GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM3743 is a 2-channel white LED driver with 
high efficiency boost regulator. With an internal 
40V/1.5A power MOSFET, it is well suited for smart 
phone backlight applications powered by 1-cell Li-Ion 
battery. The supply voltage operates from 3V to 18V. 
The boost output has an adaptive voltage regulation 
with enough low headroom voltage. The SGM3743 is 
capable of driving up to 10S2P white LEDs while 
achieving high efficiency. It supports both PWM 
dimming control and one-wire digital dimming control. A 
programmable 9-bit brightness code allows for LED 
brightness control.  
The SGM3743 includes a comprehensive set of 
protection features such as 38.5V over-voltage 
protection, 
over-current 
protection 
and 
thermal 
shutdown. Built-in soft-start circuitry avoids excessive 
inrush current during startup. 
The SGM3743 is available in a Green WLCSP 
-1.32×1.32-9B package. It operates over an ambient 
temperature range of -40℃ to +85℃.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.

NOTES: 
1. Drive the EN pin low for longer than tOW_DET after tOW_DELAY delay and before tOW_WIN expires, in order to select one-wire digital 
interface. 
2. This condition is only applied when RFA = 1. Use this feature only when the master has an open-drain output and the data line 
is required to pull high by the master through a pull-up resistor.
