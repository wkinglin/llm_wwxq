GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM458 is a low power, low supply voltage, CSP 
package, serial control interface and digital output 
temperature sensor with an accuracy of ±1℃ (TYP) in 
the temperature range of -55℃ to +125℃. The serial 
two-wire interface supports traditional I2C bus or 
SMBus interface. Multiple device access instruction is 
used in this serial bus, so multiple SGM458 devices (up 
to three) can share one serial bus. The micro-controller 
will communicate with these devices on the bus without 
sending separate instructions which increases the 
efficiency of software. In multiple hot points monitoring 
systems such as computing platform, the design can be 
realized by connecting one serial bus with multiple 
temperature sensors. The SGM458 has a power supply 
voltage range of 1.6V to 5.5V, so the 1.8V I/O of the 
micro-controller can be used as the power supply of 
SGM458. 
The SGM458 is available in a Green WLCSP-0.85× 
0.85-4B package and specified over a temperature 
range of -55℃ to +125℃.

Figure 3. I2C Timing Diagram 
Figure 3 to Figure 7 illustrate how the I2C works for the digital output of SGM458. The bus definition of Figure 3 is shown as 
below: 
Bus Idle: SDA and SCL are in high position in this mode. 
Start Data Transfer: When SCL remains in high position and SDA changes from high to low, a START condition occurs. The 
transmission should always be launched with a START condition. 
Stop Data Transfer: When SCL remains in high position and SDA changes from low to high, a STOP condition occurs. The 
transmission should always be finished with a STOP condition. 
Data Transfer: The data bytes transferred between START and STOP condition are determined by the master device. 
Acknowledge: The acknowledge signal should be generated to guarantee that the receiving device is addressed. The SDA 
should be pulled low for the entire clock pulse of SCL during the acknowledge time. Both the data hold time and data setup time 
should also be considered. If the master is a receiving in this case, the receiver can also send a not-acknowledge pulse on the 
last byte.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
Overview 
For the management of thermal profiling and 
management, the SGM458 has a better performance 
with the digital output and WLCSP package. The digital 
output can also be used for I2C interface and SMBus 
interface. In addition, it supports up to three SGM458 
connections, sharing one I2C interface to connect to the 
master device. The commands of MDA can decrease 
the communication time and the power dissipation 
which is caused by the multiple connection of SGM458. 
For normal operation, the temperature range of the 
SGM458 is from -55℃ to +125℃. 
The I2C interface supports a maximum of three 
SGM458 connections. There are three different 
addresses for SGM458, which indicates different 
address for the salve device. Also, the internal register 
can write or read a byte with the I2C interface. The 
function of MDA allows all connected slave devices to 
communicate without sending the corresponding 
address to each SGM458. 
For Figure 8, the pull-up resistors are required for the 
communication of I2C interface, and a 0.01µF bypass 
capacitor is also required to reduce the interface from 
power supply noise.

Figure 8. Typical Connections 
The thermal paths of SGM458 are provided by the 
bumping of the internal thermal resistance. The 
accuracy of the measurement for surface or air 
environment would be enhanced by isolating the 
SGM458 from the ambient temperature. 
 
Feature Description 
The resolution of the SGM458 is just 0.0625℃ and the 
two-wire digital structure can support MDA and I2C 
interfaces. 
The mechanism of multiple device access (MDA) 
allows the slave to communicate at the same time, 
rather than sending the address for each slave device. 
Up to three SGM458 devices can be connected in 
parallel for easy reading, which means that the master 
device can simply read them with the I2C interface. 
For power-sensitive and space-constrained applications, 
the SGM458 is a good choice and can be monitored by 
the master. 
 
Programming 
Temperature Watchdog Function 
There is a watchdog function inside the SGM458 to 
check if the measured temperature is higher than the 
upper threshold or lower threshold of the device 
through THIGH and TLOW registers. The flag-high bit (FH) 
is set to high if the measured temperature is higher 
than THIGH, and the flag-low bit (FL) is set to high if the 
measured temperature is lower than TLOW. For the 
normal measurement case, if both FH and FL bit are 
set to low state, it means that the measured 
temperature is lower than THIGH and higher than TLOW. 
The above three different cases are shown in Figure 9.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
The function of latch bit (LC) is used to pull the 
corresponding FH and FL bit high in latching mode and 
generate a pulse if the temperature is higher or lower 
than the limitation until the master completes read and 
sends a read command to the slave. If a read 
command is already received by SGM458 after a LC 
pulse or the measured temperature is within the 
limitations, the LC function will be low. For the default 
values when power-on, the LC, FH and FL are all in low 
state. 
 
Conversion Rate 
Users can set the value of CR1 and CR0 that are 
located in the corresponding register to adjust the 
conversion rates. Typically, the conversion time for 
SGM458 is 13ms. If the users desire to set a different 
conversion rate, the single conversion will be achieved 
first, and then the device will be powered down to wait 
the appropriate CR1 and CR0. The corresponding 
value of CR1 and CR0 is shown in Table 2.

The startup conversion is taken placed immediately as 
the power-up or general-call reset. For the first result of 
the conversion, it should be after 13ms. For the active 
mode, the quiescent current for the conversion is 77µA 
(typical at +25℃, VCC = 1.8V). For the delay mode, the 
quiescent current in this period is just 2.5µA (typical at 
+25℃, VCC = 1.8V).

When the shutdown mode operates, all of the circuitry 
inside SGM458 will be shutdown with the quiescent 
current of 0.7µA (TYP). If the values of M1 and M0 are 
equal to 0, the device will enter to shutdown mode after 
the conversion is completed. 
 
One-Shot (M1 = 0, M0 = 1) 
The one-shot mode can be supported by SGM458. For 
single conversion of the temperature measurement, 
simply writing 01 to M1 and M0 respectively when the 
device is in shutdown mode. The values of M1 and M0 
are 01 in the conversion period. After finishing the 
conversion, the SGM458 will return to shutdown mode 
immediately and the values of M1 and M0 will convert 
to 00. For the applications that do not need to measure 
the temperature continuously, this feature can reduce 
the power consumption of the circuit. 
The higher conversion rate can be achieved by 
SGM458 as well. A read command can be taken place 
in less than 20µs while a single conversion will take 
13ms. When M1 and M0 are equal to 01 respectively 
(one-shot mode), the conversions can be greater than 
or equal to 30 times per second. 
 
Continuous Conversion Mode (M1 = 1) 
If the device is operated at continuous mode with M1 = 
1, the conversion rate is determined by the bits of CR1 
and CR0. For the process of the continuous conversion, 
it starts with a single conversion and then operates in 
shutdown mode until the master sends the values to 
CR1 and CR0 bits. 
 
Bus Overview 
The device which can send the command to the target 
register is called master and the device which can be 
controlled by the master is called slave. The master 
device can generate the clock signal to the slave in 
order to control it with SCL and SDA lines. 
Send a specific address to start the slave, the SDA 
signal will be pulled from high to low while SCL is still in 
high state. For the slaves connected to the bus, at the 
CLK rising edge, the slaves start to be addressed by 
the master, and followed by a READ or WRITE bit. For 
the ninth bit of the transmission signal, if SDA is pulled 
low, the slave acknowledges the transmission, in which 
case the slave is being addressed.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
In one word, for the data transfer process, the initial 
signal will indicate a start state, and then followed by 
eight clock pulsed and an acknowledge signal. 
However, the stability of SDA signal should be 
guaranteed when SCL is high, otherwise it will be 
mistaken for START or STOP mode. After the 
transmission completes, the signal of SDA will change 
from low to high when SCL is high. 
 
Serial Interface 
On the two-wire bus or SMBus, the SGM458 can be 
operated as a slave device, which is controlled by the 
master. When connecting to the bus, both SDA and 
SCL pins are connected through the topology of 
open-drain. In addition, in order to improve the 
performance of slave devices under the condition of 
input peak value and noise bus, filter and Schmitt 
flip-flop are adopted. There are two modes of 
transmission protocol: fast mode (1kHz to 400kHz) and 
high-speed mode (1kHz to 3.4MHz). MSB is the first bit 
to be transferred when transmitting a byte. 
 
Serial Bus Address 
For the definition of I2C communication, before sending 
data, the master device should address the specified 
slave device. There are seven bits for the address of 
the slave device and another one bit is for the 
command of reading or writing. 
The SGM458 has three different slave addresses as 
shown in Table 3. For the function of the address, it can 
use to indicate the location or designator of 
temperature for three different connected slave 
SGM458s.

Writing and Reading Operation 
In order to access the specified pointer register of 
SGM458, it is necessary to send the values of the 
desired pointer register after addressing the slave 
device. As already illustrates in Figure 3, the values of 
pointer register are required after each write command. 
If the master device desires to read the information of 
the specified register, a write command must be send 
by the master at first to indicate which pointer register is 
needed. First, the slave address should be sent with 
the low state of R/W
ഥ, followed by the address of the 
pointer address. Second, the START command should 
be sent by the master, the slave address of the 
specified SGM458, and then followed with the high 
state of R/W
ഥ to indicate a read command (Figure 4). 
For the condition of repeated reading, it is not required 
for sending the bytes of pointer register again, unless 
the device is reset or the address of pointer register is 
altered by the write command. 
 
Slave Receiver Mode and Slave Transmitter Mode 
The SGM458 can also transmit or receive the 
information under read or write condition. The device 
cannot drive the SCL signal when used as a slave 
device. 
When the slave is desired to receive the data, the 
master will firstly send a slave address to the slave, 
followed by R/W
ഥ is low. After transmitting the slave 
address, the slave (SGM458) will pull SDA low to 
indicate an acknowledgement. Then, the address of 
pointer register is sent by the master and an 
acknowledgement signal is also required for the slave 
device. In addition, the data is written to the addressing 
pointer register, followed by the acknowledgement 
signal from the slave device. If the master wants to stop 
the transmission, a START or STOP command is 
required. 
The R/W
ഥ is pulled high after the slave address is 
transmitted by the master device, followed by an 
acknowledgement of the slave. Then, the data is 
transmitted by the specified pointer register of the slave 
device, followed by the acknowledgement of the master. 
In addition, if the master wants to stop the transmission, 
it can generate a not-acknowledge command or 
generate a START or STOP command to terminate the 
transmission.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
General Call 
The SGM458 also supports a general call address 
(0000000) when the eighth bit is low. After receiving an 
acknowledgement signal from the slave device, the 
master prepares to send a second byte to the device. In 
this case, if the second byte is 00000110, the slave 
device (SGM458) will go into power-up mode and reset 
all registers. However, the SGM458 cannot acquire an 
address for general call from the master device. 
 
High-Speed (Hs) Mode 
If the transmission frequency is greater than 400kHz, in 
order for SGM458 to work in high-speed mode, the byte 
that is 00001xxx must be transmitted after the START 
condition by the master. 00001xxx command can be 
sent up to 1MHz (see Table 4 below) even when the 
SGM458 is in default mode (which is fast mode).

However, the SGM458 does not need to generate an 
acknowledge byte, but the input and output filters can 
be adjusted accordingly (up to 3.4MHz) to make 
SGM458 operate in high-speed mode. After the 
high-speed byte is transmitted, the master will transmit 
a START command, followed by the slave address to 
the SGM458. In addition, the high-speed mode will stop 
once the STOP command is transmitted from the 
master, and the input and output filters of SGM458 will 
be switched to the default mode. 
 
Timeout Function 
If the SCL line is pulled low by 30ms, it means that the 
SGM458 will perform reset mode. Under this condition, 
the bus is released by SGM458 and then another 
START function is required for operation. To prevent 
the device goes into the timeout function, the operation 
frequency of the SCL should be greater than or equal to 
1kHz. 
 
Multiple Device Access (MDA) 
The function of MDA can allow the master to 
communicate with up to three SGM458 devices on the 
same bus. There are two commands included in the 
MDA command, they are the address of MDA read 
(00000001) and MDA write (00000000). In addition, the 
SGM458 will send an acknowledge signal to the master 
after receiving a MDA command. If the users desire to 
use MDA function, the slave address of the SGM458 
must be different. 
 
Multiple Device Access Write: 
At first, the MDA write command should be sent by the 
master device, and followed by the address of the 
specified pointer register (Table 6). After that, the slave 
devices connected to the same bus waits to be 
communicated by the master. After transmitting the 
data byte to the SGM458 devices, the information will 
be saved 
inside the 
pointer register and 
an 
acknowledge signal will be sent. In addition, the same 
information will be saved by the connected devices of 
SGM458 within only one transaction (Figure 6). 
Multiple Device Access Read: 
As mentioned before, if the master reads the 
information from the connected slave devices in MDA 
mode, it must first send a write command to the pointer 
register. Then, a read command can be transmitted to 
the pointer register of the slave devices. For instance, 
there are two slave devices (SGM458A and SGM458B) 
connected on the same bus. After the master device 
sends the MDA read command, the two bytes from 
SGM458A and SGM458B should be sent and followed 
by two acknowledge signals respectively from the 
master device. For each bytes from the slave devices, 
the master must send an acknowledge signal 
respectively to ensure that it already reads the data 
bytes from the slaves (Figure 7). However, if there is no 
acknowledge signal sent from the master device for 
each byte, the slave device will stop transmitting data to 
the master for reading.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
The maximum slave devices that can be connected to 
the same bus is three, see Table 3. However, if the 
sequence of connected SGM458 devices is incomplete, 
the master should send the bytes to the dummy one as 
well to ensure that the system can operate normally. 
For instance, if SGM458A, SGM458B and SGM458D 
are connected on the same bus, after the MDA 
command is being transmitted, the four bytes and four 
ACKs must be followed in order to finish the MDA 
transaction. 
 
Noise 
Because of the low power property of SGM458, the 
level of noise generated by the SGM458 is low. 
However, in order to further reduce the noise problem 
of SGM458 and ensure that it does not affect other 
devices connected on the same power supply, an RC 
filter can be taken in account. The resistance value 
should be lower than 5kΩ and the capacitance value 
should be greater than 10nF.

Figure 12. Internal Register Structure 
 
Pointer Register 
The registers of the SGM458 is shown in Figure 12. 
There is a pointer register followed by the I/O pins, 
which can give address for the following four registers. 
The three LSBs of the pointer register indicate which 
register the master wants to communicate with. The 
byte detail information is shown in Table 6. If the master 
wants to send a write command to the pointer register, 
P[7:3] must be set to 0. Table 7 indicates the address of 
the internal registers. If P[2:0] is 000, it also means that 
the device will be in the power-on reset mode, which 
means that SGM458 can also read the temperature 
when it is on power-up. 
 
Temperature Register 
The resolution of SGM458 is 12 bits, and the device 
can only support the function of reading. However, for 
the READ command, the two bytes should be 
transmitted by SGM458. That is, the MSB is for byte 1 
and LSB is for byte 2. For the code of temperature, the 
first 12 bits represent the temperature converted by the 
internal ADC. If the customer application does not 
require information about TD[3:0], this part of the least 
significant bit is useless. 
Negative numbers are represented in binary twos 
complement format. Following power-up or reset, the 
Temperature Register reads 0 until the first conversion 
completes. 
The following equations illustrate how to transfer digital 
format to analog format or how to transfer analog 
format to digital format. 
For converting the positive temperature to the 
corresponding digital signal: 
1. The result of the temperature should be divided by 
the LSB of the temperature. 
2. After calculation, convert the decimal value to binary 
value and then the digital signal is obtained. 
Example: (50 ℃)/(0.0625 ℃/LSB) = 800 = 320h = 
001100100000 
For converting the digital signal to the corresponding 
temperature: 
1. Firstly, convert the 12-bit digital signal to the 
corresponding decimal value, and MSB = 0 means that 
the corresponding temperature is a positive value. 
2. The result of decimal value should be multiplied by 
the LSB to get the corresponding temperature. 
Example: 001100100000 = 320h = 800 × (0.0625℃
/LSB) = 50℃ 
For converting the positive temperature to the 
corresponding digital signal: 
1. The result of the absolute temperature should be 
divided by the LSB of the temperature. 
2. The value of two’s complement format can be 
obtained by obtaining the complementary of the result 
digital signal and adding 1. 
Example: (|-25℃|)/(0.0625℃/LSB) = 400 = 190h = 
000110010000 
Two's complement format: 111001101111 + 1 = 
111001110000

REGISTER DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Configuration Register 
Configuration Register 
The operation mode is defined in the configuration 
register. MSB code indicates the state of read (R) or 
write (W
ഥ). Table 10 illustrates the structure of the 
configuration register. All registers will be updated at 
the end of the bytes. 
 
Temperature Limit Registers 
The thresholds that are THIGH and TLOW indicate the two 
temperature limits for the function of watchdog. After 
measuring the temperature, the device will compare the 
result value with two thresholds to check if it exceeds 
the limitation. FH bit will be set to high state if the 
measured temperature is greater than THIGH. FL bit will 
be set to high state if the measured temperature is 
greater than TLOW (Figure 12). 
Table 13 and Table 14 illustrate the corresponding byte 
to set the THIGH and TLOW thresholds. At the instant of 
power-on reset, the default values of THIGH and TLOW 
are +60℃ and -10℃ respectively.

Design Requirements 
The pull-up resistors on the SCL and SDA pins of 
SGM458 are necessary. The selection of the pull-up 
resistors is important because it will affect the sinking 
capability of the I/O pins of the SGM458. Also, the 
0.01µF bypass capacitor needs to be placed as close 
to the power supply pin of the device as possible. 
 
Detailed Design Procedure 
When measuring the heat source, the SGM458 must 
be placed as close to the measured source as 
possible, and a good layout is also required for the 
coupling of heat. Furthermore, this kind of placement 
can make sure that changes in the measured 
temperature can be detected as quickly as possible. 
In addition, the accuracy of the measurement for 
surface or air environment will be enhanced by 
isolating the SGM458 from the ambient temperature. 
Due to the low power consumption characteristics of 
SGM458, the noise level generated by the SGM458 is 
low. To further reduce the noise issue from SGM458 
and ensure that it does not affect other devices 
connected to the same power supply, an RC filter can 
be taken into account, and the value of resistor should 
be lower than 5kΩ and the value of capacitor should 
be greater than 10nF. 
 
Power Supply Recommendations 
The supported power supply range of the SGM458 is 
from 1.6V to 5.5V. For the optimized power supplies 
of the SGM458, they are 1.8V, 2.8V, 3.3V and 5.0V 
respectively. However, the measured accuracy can 
be guaranteed by the whole power supply range. 
 
Layout Guidelines 
A 0.01µF bypass capacitor should be placed as close 
to the power supply pin as possible. And for the noisy 
power supply case, another capacitor should be 
added to reject the noise of the power supply. Two 
5kΩ resistors are also required for SDA and SCL pins 
for their open-drain topology.
