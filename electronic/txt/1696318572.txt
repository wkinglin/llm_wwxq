OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

28.5V, 7A Fully-Integrated 
SGM6613A 
Synchronous Boost Converter

SEPTEMBER 2023

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
The SGM6613A is a synchronous Boost converter 
integrating a 17mΩ low-side power switch and a 31mΩ 
high-side power switch. It is capable of delivering up to 
7A peak current and up to 28.5V output voltage. In 
moderate to heavy load condition, the SGM6613A 
works at a fixed frequency PWM mode. In light load 
condition, the SGM6613A works in the forced PWM 
mode to avoid the acoustic noise and switching 
frequency interference. 
Excellent line and 
load 
transient response can be achieved with minimal output 
capacitance by applying a peak current control topology. 
The external loop compensation makes a wider range 
of 
inductor 
and 
output 
capacitor 
combinations 
available. 
The SGM6613A supports the resistor-programmable 
switching frequency of up to 700kHz. In Boost 
operation, the device can avoid overload with the 
help of peak current control topology. In addition, 
during an over-current event, if the VOUT drops and 
triggers hiccup mode, the SGM6613A enters into 
hiccup mode to provide a 70ms hiccup off-time to 
prevent the IC from overheating, thus triggering thermal 
shutdown. Device will recover automatically once the 
over-current condition is removed. 
Input Under-Voltage Lockout (UVLO) 
An under-voltage lockout circuit prevents operation of 
the device at input voltages below typical 3.94V with a 
hysteresis of 160mV. Therefore, if the input voltage 
rises and exceeds 4.1V (TYP), the device restarts. 
Enable and Disable 
When the input voltage exceeds minimum input voltage 
during startup and the EN voltage is higher than its 
logic high threshold, the SGM6613A is enabled. When 
the EN voltage is lower than its logic low threshold, the 
SGM6613A enters shutdown mode. 
Startup 
The SGM6613A implements the soft-start function to 
reduce the inrush current during startup. The device 
first charges the output voltage to 1.1×VIN with the fixed 
500kHz switching frequency during pre-charge phase. 
After the pre-charge phase (2.7ms, TYP), the output 
voltage will rise gradually and linearly to the target 
value. The soft-start time is typically 11ms. Then, the 
switching frequency is set by the resistor connected 
through the FREQ pin. 
Adjustable Peak Current Limit 
To avoid accidental large peak current, an internal 
cycle-by-cycle current limit is adopted. 
Connecting a resistor to the ILIM pin can set the peak 
current limit. Calculate the correct resistor value 
according to Equation 1 as below: 
=
LIM
LIM
730
R
I
 
(1) 
where: 
RLIM is the resistor used to set the current limit (kΩ). 
ILIM is peak current limit (A). 
For example, a 107kΩ resistor gives a 6.8A peak current 
limit. 
Adjustable Switching Frequency 
The SGM6613A has an adjustable switching frequency 
up to 700kHz. The switching frequency is set by an 
external resistor (RFREQ) connected between the FREQ 
pin and AGND pin. Do not leave the FREQ pin floating. 
The resistor value is calculated by equations as follows.

For example, when RFREQ is 330kΩ, the frequency is 
500kHz. If the frequency is set to more than 500kHz, 
lower inductance is recommended such that 1.8μH 
inductance is selected for 700kHz.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Start-up with Pre-biased Output 
The low-side switch is prohibited from turning on and 
discharging the output if a pre-biased voltage is sensed 
on the output before start-up. As long as the internal 
soft-start voltage is higher than VFB, the low-side switch 
is allowed to sink current to have a monotonic start-up 
with pre-biased output. 
 
Bootstrap Voltage (BOOT) 
A small ceramic capacitor between the BOOT pin and 
the SW pin provides gate current to charge the gate of 
the high-side MOSFET device during the on-time of 
each cycle and to charge the bootstrap capacitor. The 
value of this capacitor is recommended to be above 
0.1µF. 
 
Device Functional Modes 
The synchronous Boost converter SGM6613A operates 
at a constant frequency PWM mode in moderate to 
heavy load condition. The low-side N-MOSFET switch 
is turned on at the start of a cycle, and the inductor 
current increases to a peak current determined by the 
EA. After the peak current is reached, the current 
comparator trips, and it disables the low-side 
N-MOSFET switch and the inductor current goes 
through the body diode of the high-side N-MOSFET in 
a dead-time duration. After the dead-time duration, the 
high-side N-MOSFET switch is turned on. Because the 
output voltage is larger than the input voltage, the 
inductor current decreases. After a short dead-time 
duration, the low-side switch is turned on again and the 
switching cycle is repeated. 
To avoid sub-harmonic oscillation, the SGM6613A has 
internal slope compensation. 
In the forced PWM mode, the SGM6613A keeps the 
switching frequency constant in light load condition. As 
the load current reduces, the output of the internal error 
amplifier also decreases. Thus, the inductor current limit 
is lowered and less power is delivered from input to 
output. When the output current is reduced further, the 
current through the inductor will decrease to zero 
during the off-time. Even if the current through the 
MOSFET becomes negative, the high-side MOSFET 
will not turn off. 
This mode is good for mitigating the acoustic noise and 
switching frequency interference at the light load. 
When VOUT is close to VIN, the Boost converter cannot 
support the duty cycle anymore. It enables built-in 
Diode mode which enables the converter to regulate 
the output voltage. When operating in Diode mode, the 
converter's rectifier switch stops switching to regulate 
the output voltage. The efficiency during Diode mode 
operation is reduced so that it is recommended that VIN 
should be at least 5V lower than VOUT. 
 
Over-Voltage Protection (OVP) 
The SGM6613A provides 30.2V (TYP) OVP threshold. 
The device stops switching immediately until the 
voltage at the VOUT pin drops 600mV below the 
output OVP threshold. The OVP circuitry monitors the 
output voltage (VOUT) and protects VOUT and SW from 
exceeding safe operating voltages. 
 
Thermal Shutdown 
To prevent thermal damage, the device has an internal 
temperature monitor. If the die temperature exceeds 
+150℃ (TYP), the device stops switching. Once the 
temperature drops below +130℃ (TYP), the device 
resumes operation.

APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued) 
Setting the Peak Current Limit 
The peak current limit of the SGM6613A is set by an 
external resistor. For setting a current limit of 6.8A, the 
resistor value is 107kΩ after calculation. Due to the 
distribution of the current limit, it is recommended to 
select a resistor about 10% less than the calculated 
value for safety. Here, 93.6kΩ resistor is a preferable 
choice. 
 
Setting the Output Voltage 
The output voltage is set by a resistor divider network. 
Calculate the output voltage by Equation 4:

V

R







          (4) 
where: 
VOUT is the output voltage. 
RUP is the top divider resistor. 
RDOWN is the bottom divider resistor. 
For setting an output voltage of 28.5V, select RDOWN to 
be approximately 80.6kΩ, calculated by Equation 4, 
and RUP is 1.83MΩ. 
 
Selecting the Output Capacitors 
It is recommended to use 3 × 22μF X5R or X7R MLCC 
capacitors connected in parallel for most applications. 
Refer to Table 3. 
 
Selecting the Input Capacitor 
A 22μF input capacitor is enough for most applications. 
To reduce the input current ripple, larger values may 
also be allowed. See Table 3. 
 
Selecting the Bootstrap Capacitor 
A 0.047μF ~ 0.1μF capacitor value range is recommended 
for bootstrap capacitor. And 0.1μF is used in this design. 
Refer to Table 3. 
 
VCC Capacitor 
The value of CVCC should be at least 10 times larger 
than the value of CBOOT. A 1μF ~ 4.7μF capacitor value 
range is recommended for CVCC. A value of 4.7μF is 
recommended in this example, please see Table 3. 
 
Layout Guidelines 
As for all switching power supplies, especially those 
high frequency and high current ones, layout is an 
important design step. Poor layout could result in 
system instability, EMI failure, and device damage. 
Therefore, use wide and short traces for high current 
paths. Thus, place input capacitor as close to the VIN 
pin and GND pin as possible. If possible choose higher 
capacitance value for CIN. The SW pin carries high 
current with fast rising and falling edges, therefore, all 
connections to the SW pin should be kept as short and 
wide as possible. The output capacitor COUT (3 × 22μF) 
should be put close to VOUT pin. It is beneficial to have 
the ground of COUT close to the PGND pin since there is 
large ground return current flowing between them. It is 
also recommended to place an additional 1μF ceramic 
capacitor directly across the VOUT and PGND pins. 
Sensitive signals like FB, COMP traces must be placed 
away from SW trace. The ground of these signals 
should be connected to GND pin and separated with 
power ground.
