GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM05HB1AM is designed to protect voltage 
sensitive components from ESD. Excellent clamping 
capability, low leakage, high peak pulse current 
handling capability and fast response time provide best 
in class protection on designs that are exposed to ESD. 
Because of its small size, it is suited for use in cellular 
phones, tablets, digital cameras and many other portable 
applications where board space comes at a premium. 
 
FEATURES 
● Low Clamping Voltage 
● Low Leakage 
● Small Package: UTDFN-1×0.6-2AL 
● Protection for the Following IEC Standards: 
IEC 61000-4-2 Level 4: ±30kV Contact Discharge 
IEC 61000-4-5 (Lightning) 30A (8/20μs)

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
The TVS is designed to provide a bidirectional line for dissipating ESD events on high-speed signal. The TVS is 
suitable for lines with positive and negative signal polarity relative to the ground. 
 
ESD Protection Line
GND
 
 
The following guidelines are recommended: 
1. TVS Placement 
Place the TVS as close to the input connector as possible. 
2. TVS's Trace Layout 
Avoid running protected traces in parallel with unprotected traces. 
Minimize the path length between the TVS and the protected line. 
Minimize parallel signal path length. 
Route the protected traces as straight as possible. 
3. GND Layout 
Avoid using a common ground point shared with the TVS transient return path. 
Minimize the length of the TVS transient return path to ground. 
Use ground vias as close as possible to the TVS transient return to ground.
