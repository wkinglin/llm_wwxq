GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM61031 is an efficient high frequency 
synchronous Buck converter with an input voltage 
range of 2.7V to 5.5V and a wide output current range 
that is optimized for compact solutions. It operates in 
PWM mode at heavy loads and automatically enters 
power-save mode (PSM) at light loads to maintain its 
high efficiency. 
To meet the requirements of system power rails, the 
output capacitors with values above 100μF can be 
used by the internal loop compensation.  
With its adaptive hysteresis and pseudo-constant 
on-time control (AHP-COT) architecture, the load 
transient performance is excellent and the output 
voltage regulation accuracy is achieved.  
The SGM61031 is available in a Green TDFN-2×2-8AL 
package.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
Overview 
The SGM61031 is a high-efficient Buck converter with 
AHP-COT 
architecture 
and 
advanced 
regulation 
topology. 
At medium to heavy loads, the device works in pulse 
width modulation (PWM) mode. At light loads, it 
automatically switches to power-save mode (PSM). In 
PWM mode, the device works with a nominal switching 
frequency of 2MHz. When the load current falls, the 
device goes into PSM to achieve high efficiency with 
reducing switching frequency and minimizing quiescent 
current. 
Under-Voltage Lockout (UVLO) 
The device implements the under-voltage lockout 
(UVLO) with a 130mV (TYP) hysteresis. When the 
input voltage falls below the VUVLO, it shuts down the 
device. 
Device Enable and Disable 
A logic high input to EN pin activates the device, and a 
logic low disables the device. Do not leave it floating. 
Power Good (PG) 
The power good output of SGM61031 will be low in the 
condition that the output voltage is less than its nominal 
value. If the output exceeds 95% of the regulated 
voltage, the power good is in high-impedance state. If 
the output voltage is less than 90% of the regulated 
voltage, the power good is driven to low.  
The PG pin is an open-drain output with a maximum of 
0.5mA sink current. A pull-up resistor connecting to 
power good output is required. When the device is 
disabled, under-voltage lockout, or thermal shutdown, 
the PG pin is driven to High-Z (see Table 1). The PG 
signal connected to the EN pin of other converters can 
be used for multiple rails sequences. Leave the PG pin 
floating when not in use.

Low Dropout Operation (100% Duty Cycle) 
The device provides low input-to-output voltage drop by 
going into 100% duty cycle mode. In this mode, the 
high-side MOSFET is constantly turned on and the 
low-side MOSFET is turned off. This function can 
increase the operation time to the utmost extent for 
battery 
powered 
applications. 
To 
maintain 
an 
appropriate output voltage, the minimum input voltage 
is calculated by:

where: 
• VIN_MIN is the minimum input voltage.  
• IOUT_MAX is the maximum output current.  
• RDSON is the high-side MOSFET on-resistance.  
• RL is the inductor ohmic resistance. 
Output Discharge 
Whenever the device is disabled by enable, thermal 
shutdown or under-voltage lockout, the output is 
discharged by the SW pin through a typical discharge 
resistor of RDIS.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Soft-Start 
When EN pin is set to logic high and after about 150μs 
delay, the device starts switching and VOUT increases 
with 600μs (TYP) internal soft-start circuit. 
Inductor Current Limit 
If there is over-current or short-circuit, the device 
implements an inductor current limit. Both the peak 
current of high-side and valley current of low-side 
power MOSFETs are limited to protect the device. The 
high-side MOSFET is turned off and the low-side 
MOSFET is turned on to reduce the inductor current 
when the high-side switch current limit is triggered. The 
low-side MOSFET is turned off and the high-side switch 
is turned on again when the inductor current drops to 
the low-side switch current limit. It repeats until the 
inductor current falls below the high-side switch current 
limit. The actual current limit value may be larger than 
the static current limit due to internal propagation 
delays. 
Power-Save Mode 
Once the load current decreases, the SGM61031 will 
enter power-save mode. Then, the device has a 
reduced switching frequency and works with the 
minimum quiescent current to keep high efficiency. In 
power-save mode, the inductor current is discontinuous. 
Then a fixed on-time architecture is activated and the 
typical on-time is tON = 500ns × (VOUT/VIN). 
Thermal Shutdown 
To protect the device from overheating damage, 
thermal protection is included in the device. If the 
junction temperature exceeds the typical TJSD (+160℃ 
TYP), the switching will stop. When the device 
temperature 
drops 
below 
the 
threshold 
minus 
hysteresis, the switching will resume automatically.

Adjustable Output Voltage 
An external resistor divider connected to FB pin is used 
for setting the output voltage. Through adjusting R1 and 
R2, the output voltage can be programmed to the 
desired value. Calculate R1 and R2 with Equation 2.

R2 should be less than 40kΩ for higher accuracy. Make 
sure that the current flowing through R2 is at least 100 
times greater than the current of FB pin. A lower value 
of R2 increases the robustness against noise injection, 
and higher values reduce the input current.  
A feed-forward capacitor (C4) is recommended to 
improve the performance of smooth transition into 
power-save mode and reduce undershoot during load 
transient. 10pF to 20pF is enough for typical applications. 
Inductor Selection 
Equation 3 is conventionally used to calculate the 
output inductance of a Buck converter. The inductor 
should be selected by its value and the saturation 
current. The saturation current of inductor should be 
higher than IL_MAX in Equation 3, and sufficient margin 
should be reserved. Typically, the current above 
high-side current limit is enough, and a 10% to 30% 
ripple current is selected to calculate the inductance. 
Larger inductor can reduce the ripple current, but with 
an increasing response time.

Capacitor Selection 
For input capacitor design, a X5R/X7R dielectric 
ceramic capacitor should be selected for its low ESR 
and high frequency performance. 10μF is enough for 
most applications. The voltage rating of input capacitor 
must be considered for its significant bias effect. The 
input ripple voltage can be calculated from Equation 4.

                  (4) 
The ripple current rating of input capacitor should be 
greater than ICIN_RMS in Equation 5 and the maximum 
value occurs at 50% duty cycle. A 0.1μF capacitor is 
suggested to add for further input decoupling of device.  
ICIN_RMS = IOUT×ට
VOUT × ൫VIN-VOUT൯
VIN × VIN
=IOUT×ටD×൫1-D൯   (5) 
For output capacitor design, output ripple, transient 
response and loop stability should be considered. 
Minimum capacitance of output ripple criteria can be 
calculated from Equation 6.  
COUT > 
∆IL
8 × fSW × VOUT_RIPPLE             (6) 
Both the input and output capacitors should be placed 
as close to VIN, SENSE and GND pins as possible to 
reduce noise caused by PCB parasitic parameters.  
Higher nominal capacitance value or rating voltage 
must be chosen due to aging, temperature, and 
significant DC bias derating of the ceramic capacitors. 
In this example, 22μF/16V X5R ceramic capacitor is 
used as input and output capacitors. 
Output Filter Design 
To simplify customer's design process, the inductor and 
output capacitor combinations are recommended in

LAYOUT Guidelines 
Good PCB layout is the key factor for high performance 
operation of a device regarding the stability, regulation, 
efficiency and other performance measures.  
A list of guidelines for designing the PCB layout of 
SGM61031 is provided below:  
● Place the power components close together and 
connect them with short and wide routes. The low-side 
of the capacitors must be connected to GND properly to 
avoid potential shift. 
● Signal traces are connected to the FB and SENSE 
pins. Connect the inductor with a short trace. Keep the 
traces away from SW nodes. 
● Typical suggested layout is provided in Figure 4.
