GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM41573 is a synchronous Buck-Boost battery charge 
controller with NVDC power path management. It can provide 
high efficiency and low component count solution for 1-cell to 
4-cell batteries charging applications. 
The system is regulated slightly to be higher than the battery 
voltage, but not lower than the programmable system 
minimum voltage. Therefore, the system power is maintained 
even if the battery is completely depleted or removed. 
Dynamic power management (DPM) feature is also included 
that automatically reduces the charge current if the input 
current or voltage limit is reached. If the system load 
continues to increase after reduction of charge current down 
to zero, the battery enters the supplement mode and both 
adapter and battery power the system. 
A wide range of input sources are supported for SGM41573, 
including traditional adapters, USB adapter and high voltage 
USB PD sources. The converter is configured as Buck, Boost 
or Buck-Boost during power-up, depending on the input 
source and battery conditions. The charger automatically 
switches among Buck, Boost and Buck-Boost without host 
control. 
When the input source is absent, the SGM41573 can work in 
USB On-The-Go (OTG) mode to supply VBUS from battery. 
The OTG output voltage can be programmed from 3V to 
20.56V with 8mV resolution. The slew rate of the output 
voltage transitions in OTG can be configured (by OTG current 
setting) to comply with the USB PD 3.0 PPS specifications. 
If there is no external load on the USB OTG port and the 
system is powered by battery-only, the VMIN Active Protection 
(VAP) feature is supported. In VAP, the VBUS voltage is 
charged up by the battery and the energy is stored in the 
input decoupling capacitors. When the system requires peak 
power spike, the charge stored on the input capacitor 
discharges to maintain the system voltage at minimum 
system voltage. 
Adapter current, battery current and system power are 
monitored in SGM41573. When the system power is too high 
and exceeds available power from adapter and battery 
together, a flexibly programmed nPROCHOT pulse is 
asserted to inform CPU for throttle back.

ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

I2C NVDC Buck-Boost Charge Controller 
SGM41573 
for 1- to 4-Cell Battery

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
Overview 
The SGM41573 is a charger controller with narrow voltage 
DC Buck-Boost topology that is suitable for portable 
applications such as notebooks, tablets and other mobile 
devices with rechargeable batteries. This device offers high 
light load efficiency, fast response and it can automatically 
convert among Buck, Buck-Boost, and Boost operation 
modes. 
A variety of source types, including traditional AC/DC 
adapters, USB PD and legacy USB ports with 3.58V to 24V 
voltage range can power the device for charging 1-cell to 
4-cell batteries. When there is no adapter, the USB 
On-The-Go (OTG) function can be enabled to generate 
adjustable 3V to 20.56V on the USB port with 8mV resolution 
from a 1-cell to 4-cell batteries. The slew rate of the output 
voltage transitions in OTG can be configured (by OTG current 
setting) to comply with the USB PD 3.0 PPS specifications. 
When there is only battery and no load connected to the USB 
OTG port, VMIN Active Protection (VAP) feature is provided to 
avoid system voltage drops when the load connected to 
system has rapid changes between light load and heavy load. 
When the system load is not heavy, the input decoupling 
capacitors of VVBUS are charged to store energy. During a 
system power spike, the capacitors are discharged through 
Buck-Boost converter to keep the system voltage above 
minimum voltage, because the battery impedance causes the 
significant system voltage drops during the system load steps. 
This feature is strongly recommended by Intel for 1-cell or 
2-cell battery to smooth the power peaks and improve the 
system performance when there are the high demands in the 
system. 
The DPM (dynamic power management) feature is provided 
to avoid the input overload by limiting the input power. With 
DPM, when the system power increases, the charging current 
is reduced to keep the input current below the adapter rating. 
Changing to the supplement mode may be required if the 
charge current is decreased and reached to zero, but the 
input is still overloaded. In this case, the charger reduces the 
system voltage below the battery voltage to allow operation in 
the supplement mode and provides a portion of system power 
demand from the battery through the BATFET. 
The PSYS function is provided to comply with Intel 
IMVP8/IMVP9, in which the total input power from the adapter 
and the battery is monitored. Moreover, the device provides 
an independent input current buffer (IADPT) and a battery 
current buffer (IBAT) with the accurate amplifiers. 
The input current, charge current and charge voltage 
registers can be controlled by I2C with high resolution and 
high accuracy regulation limits. The nPROCHOT timing and 
threshold profile is also set by I2C to match the system 
requirements. 
 
Power-Up from Battery without DC Source 
If the battery is the only source and VBAT > VVBAT_UVLOZ, it will 
be connected to the system by turning the BATFET on. By 
default, the charger starts in low power mode (EN_LWPWR 
bit = 1) with the lowest quiescent current and keeps the LDO 
off. The host can change charger operation to the 
performance mode (EN_LWPWR bit = 0). In this mode, the 
host can enable IBAT buffer (to monitor discharge current), 
the PSYS (to monitor total system power), nPROCHOT and 
the independent comparator through I2C. The REGN (LDO) is 
kept on in the performance mode to provide an accurate 
reference for other functions. 
 
VMIN Active Protection (VAP) when Battery- 
Only Mode 
In the VMIN Active Protection (VAP) mode, the VBUS 
decoupling capacitors are charged to their highest possible 
voltages (e.g. 20V) by the Buck-Boost converter from the 
battery. For a system with 2S1P or 1S2P battery configuration, 
the peak system power may reach 100W if the SoC and 
system power spike at the same time. Such coincidence is 
normally rare, but is still possible. At this time, the energy 
stored in the input decoupling capacitors will be able to 
supplement the battery through Buck-Boost converter to 
avoid system voltage drops. With the VAP mode, the higher 
peak power levels can be set to the SoC to provide much 
better turbo performance. 
The following steps must be followed to enter VAP operation: 
1. VBAT should not cause a SYSOVP trip that stops 
converter switching. 
2. VAP output voltage is set by OTGVoltage and 
OTG_RANGE_LOW registers. If OTG_RANGE_LOW bit = 0, 
a 1.28V offset is added to the VOTG from digital DAC to 
achieve the higher ranges from 4.28V to 20.56V. If 
OTG_RANGE_LOW bit = 1, no offset is added and the VOTG 
from digital DAC is from 3V to 19.28V. 
3. Set the VBUS charge current limit in OTGCurrent register. 
4. 
Set 
the 
system 
voltage 
regulation 
point 
in 
MinSystemVoltage register. The VSYS_MIN loop regulates 
VSYS at this point when the input capacitors supplement the 
battery.

5. Set the PROCHOT_VSYS_TH1 threshold for triggering the 
VAP discharging VBUS in VSYS_TH1[3:0] register. 
6. Set the PROCHOT_VSYS_TH2 threshold to send an 
nPROCHOT active low signal in VSYS_TH2[1:0] register. 
7. Enable VAP by setting OTG_VAP_MODE bit = 0 and 
pulling the OTG/VAP pin high. 
To terminate the VAP mode, either set the OTG_VAP_MODE 
bit = 1 or pull the OTG/VAP pin low. With any regular charger 
fault, the VAP mode is automatically terminated by resetting 
OTG_VAP_MODE bit = 1. 
 
Power-Up from DC Source 
After connecting a DC source, the input voltage is checked 
before turning on the LDO and bias circuits. The input current 
limit is also set before starting converters. 
The power-up sequence from a DC source is: 
1. 50ms after VVBUS exceeds VVBUS_CONVEN, the 5.6V LDO is 
enabled and CHRG_OK is pulled high. 
2. Poor source detection. 
3. Input voltage and current limits are set. 
4. Battery cell configuration (by reading the CELL_BATPRESZ pin 
voltage). 
5. The converter powers up. 
 
CHRG_OK Indicator 
The CHRG_OK is an open-drain, active high output, which 
indicates the normal charger operation. It is activated when 
the following conditions are met: 
• VVBUS > VVBUS_CONVEN. 
• VVBUS < VACOV. 
• There is no SYS short latch off, SYSOVP, BATOC, ACOC, 
force latch off, and thermal shutdown. 
 
Setting the Input Voltage and Current Limit 
After CHRG_OK is asserted, the default input current limit 
(3.25A) is set in IIN_HOST register. The actual limit is the 
lower of IIN_HOST register and the ILIM_HIZ pin settings.  
The VBUS measurement is enabled just before enabling the 
converter (VBUS without any load). The VINDPM threshold is 
VBUS (without any load on the converter) minus 1.28V (in 
default). The VINDPM threshold is the input voltage level at 
which the dynamic power management begins to reduce the 
charge current to avoid further system voltage drop and gives 
priority to system load rather than charging. 
The charger can be powered up with the proper input current 
and voltage limits settings. The host can always change these 
limits after powering up to match with the input source type. 
 
Battery Cell Configuration 
A resistor divider between REGN and GND and tapped to 
CELL_BATPRESZ should be used to define the battery 
configuration for the charger. The bias voltage on the 
CELL_BATPRESZ pin is measured by the device to detect 
the battery configuration after the VDDA LDO is activated. 
See Table 1 for the cell configuration voltage thresholds and 
the other affected settings. 
 
Device HIZ State 
If the voltage of the ILIM_HIZ pin falls below 0.6V or if 
EN_HIZ bit is set to 1, the charger will enter the HIZ mode 
which operates in the low quiescent current mode. And the 
system is powered from battery even when the input source is 
present. During this mode, the LDO of REGN is enabled.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Input Current Optimizer (ICO) 
The device provides the input current optimizer (ICO) to 
identify the maximum power point of the input adapter source. 
To avoid overloading the input adapter source and staying in 
VINDPM, the ICO algorithm identifies the maximum input 
current limit of the adapter and updates this input current limit 
to IIN_DPM register.  
The ICO function is disabled by default, and it can be enabled 
by the host through setting EN_ICO_MODE bit = 1. When the 
ICO routine is successfully executed, the ICO_DONE bit = 1 
notifies ICO done. 
When the ICO algorithm is enabled, it runs to dynamically and 
continuously adjust the input current limit. The operation of 
ICO algorithm depends on the battery voltage as following: 
Case 1: When VBAT < VSYSMIN, the device starts ICO algorithm 
with an initial value that equals to the IINDPM. Where the IINDPM 
is the maximum input current limit determined by the host. 
Case 2: When VBAT > VSYSMIN, the device starts ICO algorithm 
with an initial value of min (500mA, IIN_HOST).  
During the optimization, if VINDPM is triggered, the ICO 
algorithm decreases the input current limit to avoid input 
source overloading. When the maximum input current limit is 
detected, the IIN_DPM register reflects the optimal maximum 
input current limit which does not trigger VINDPM, the 
ICO_DONE bit = 1 indicates the maximum input current 
detected. 
In above case 1, if both VINDPM and IINDPM are not 
triggered, the IIN_DPM register keeps the initial value and the 
ICO_DONE bit = 0 indicates that the ICO optimization is in 
process. If the load becomes heavy, the VINDPM is still not 
triggered, but IINDPM is triggered, and the ICO algorithm is 
also completed. The IIN_DPM register remains the initial 
value unchanged, and the ICO_DONE bit = 1 indicates the 
maximum input current detected. 
In above case 2, if the VINDPM is not triggered and the 
converter is under light load condition, the IIN_DPM register 
gives a little higher input current limit than the actual input 
current. The ICO_DONE bit = 0 indicates that the ICO 
optimization is in process. If the load becomes heavy, the ICO 
algorithm automatically runs to set new IIN_DPM register 
value. 
After the ICO algorithm completes, the host changes the 
IIN_HOST register or InputVoltage register to force the ICO 
algorithm to run again. 
 
USB On-The-Go (OTG) 
The SGM41573 supports USB OTG operation and can power 
other portable devices connected to the USB port from the 
battery. The OTG output voltage and current limit are set in 
OTGVoltage register and OTGCurrent register. The OTG 
mode can be enabled if the following conditions are met: 
• VBAT should not cause a SYSOVP trip that stops converter 
switching. 
• OTG output voltage is set by OTGVoltage and 
OTG_RANGE_LOW registers. If OTG_RANGE_LOW bit = 0, 
a 1.28V offset is added to the VOTG from digital DAC to 
achieve the higher ranges from 4.28V to 20.56V. If 
OTG_RANGE_LOW bit = 1, no offset is added and the VOTG 
from digital DAC is from 3V to 19.28V. 
• OTG output current is set in OTGCurrent register. 
• 
OTG/VAP 
pin 
is 
high, 
EN_OTG 
bit 
= 
1 
and 
OTG_VAP_MODE bit = 1. 
• VVBUS < VVBUS_CONVEN. 
• 10ms after having all above conditions valid, the converter 
starts to generate OTG output from the battery and VBUS 
ramps up to the target voltage. The CHRG_OK pin goes high 
only if OTG_ON_CHRGOK bit = 1. 
 
Converter Operation Modes 
A synchronous Buck-Boost converter with the external 
N-channel MOSFET switches is used by this device such that 
it can charge batteries from a standard 5V or a higher voltage 
source. It can operate in Buck, Boost or Buck-Boost mode 
depending on the input/output voltage conditions. The 
Buck-Boost covers all voltage conditions with smooth 
transitions between them and continues the operation.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Inductance Detection through IADPT Pin 
Before powering up the converter, the charger can be 
informed about the inductance value (L) using an external 
resistor connected to the IADPT pin. The recommended 
resistor values for 1μH, 2.2μH and 3.3μH inductances are 
93kΩ, 137kΩ and 169kΩ, respectively, refer to Table 3. A ±3% 
or better chip resistor can be used for inductance 
identification.

Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM) 
When the system load or charging current is large enough, 
the inductor current ripples are always above zero which is 
defined as CCM. Taking Buck operation as an example, a 
new switching cycle is started by turning on the high-side 
switch (HS) each time, and the internal ramp comes up from a 
pre-biased offset. The HS will turn off and low-side switch (LS) 
turns on when the ramp exceeds the error amplifier output. 
When the ramp resets, the LS turns off and a new cycle will 
begin. A short dead time in which both MOSFETs are off is 
considered 
using 
break-before-make 
logic 
to 
avoid 
shoot-through during transition. During the dead time, the LS 
body-diode conducts the inductor current. The LS is turned on 
when the HS turns off. This keeps the losses low and 
provides safe charging at high currents. 
 
Pulse Skip Mode 
For better light-load efficiency, the converter operates with 
PSM (pulse skip mode) at light loads. In PSM, the effective 
switching frequency is reduced as the load decreases. The 
lowest PSM frequency can be limited to 25kHz by setting the 
OOA (out-of-audio frequency) bit (EN_OOA bit = 1). The 
OOA feature is enabled by default. 
 
Current and Power Monitor 
High-Accuracy Current Sense Amplifier (IADPT and 
IBAT) 
Accurate current sense amplifiers (CSA) for monitoring the 
IADPT (input current in forward charging, or the output 
current during OTG) and IBAT (the battery charge or 
discharge current) are provided as an industry standard 
feature. IADPT voltage is 20 or 40 times the ACP to ACN 
differential voltage, and IBAT voltage is 8 or 16 times the SRP 
to SRN differential voltage (charging and discharging gains 
are selectable separately). And if the input or battery voltage 
is below UVLO level, IADPT output will not be valid. 
In summary: 
• VIADPT = 20 or 40 × (VACP - VACN) in the forward mode. 
• VIADPT = 20 or 40 × (VACN - VACP) in the reverse OTG mode. 
• VIBAT = 8 or 16 × (VSRP - VSRN) in the forward mode when 
EN_ICHG_IDCHG bit = 1 
• VIBAT = 8 or 16 × (VSRN - VSRP) in the supplement mode, or 
the reverse OTG mode when EN_ICHG_IDCHG bit = 0. 
It is recommended that a small decoupling capacitor (100pF 
MAX) be connected to these outputs to absorb high 
frequency noise. An additional RC filter can be used carefully 
if needed. Pay attention that the filter will increase the 
response delay. 
 
High-Accuracy Power Sense Amplifier (PSYS) 
The total system power can also be monitored by the device. 
In the forward mode, the input adapter powers the system, 
and in the reverse OTG mode, the battery powers the system 
and the VBUS output. The PSYS pin output current is 
proportional to the total system power. The KPSYS, which is 
the ratio of the PSYS pin output current to the total system 
power, can be set in PSYS_RATIO register and its default 
value is 1μA/W. A resistor connects this output to GND to 
convert the current to an output voltage. The input and battery 
current sense resistor values (RAC and RSR) are defined for 
the 
PSYS 
calculation 
in 
RSNS_RAC 
register 
and 
RSNS_RSR register. Use Equation 1 to calculate the PSYS 
voltage. When the adapter is connected and the device is in 
forward charging, IIN > 0 and IBAT < 0. During battery 
discharge IBAT > 0: 
 
VPSYS = RPSYS × KPSYS (VACP × IIN + VBAT × IBAT) 
(1) 
And during OTG mode, there are two selectable modes in 
PSYS_OTG_IDCHG register. When PSYS_OTG_IDCHG = 0 
(default), the PSYS reports the battery discharge power 
minus OTG output power (for Equation 1, in OTG mode, IIN < 
0 and IBAT > 0). When PSYS_OTG_IDCHG = 1, the PSYS 
reports the battery discharge power only. 
RAC and RSR values should be 10mΩ or 20mΩ for proper 
PSYS function. 
The PSYS function is disabled by default to minimize the 
quiescent current. Set EN_PSYS bit = 1 to enable this 
function.

For DPM operation, please refer to the Input Current and 
Input Voltage Registers for Dynamic Power Management 
section. 
 
Two-Level Adapter Current Limit (Peak 
Power Mode) 
An adapter is generally able to provide higher than its rated 
DC current in a few milliseconds to tens of milliseconds. This 
overloading capability is used by charger through two-level 
input current limit (also called peak power mode) to minimize 
battery usage when the CPU goes in turbo mode. The peak 
power mode can be enabled in EN_PKPWR_IDPM register 
and EN_PKPWR_VSYS register. The main current limit (ILIM1) 
is set equal to the adapter current limit, read from IIN_DPM 
register. And the overload limit (ILIM2) is set as ratio of ILIM1 in 
ILIM2_VTH[4:0] register. 
As shown in Figure 4, a peak power cycle starts when an 
input current surge/battery discharge is detected by the 
charger due to a load transient (adapter and battery supply 
the system together), or by detecting a system voltage drop 
below 96% VSYSMIN. The charger first applies ILIM2 limit for a 
period of TOVLD (set in PKPWR_TOVLD_DEG[1:0] register) 
and then applies ILIM1 for up to TMAX - TOVLD time (TMAX is set in 
PKPWR_TMAX[1:0] register). A new peak power cycle will 
repeat if the overload continues after TMAX. If the TOVLD = TMAX, 
the peak power mode will be always on. 
 
Processor Hot Indication 
In turbo mode, the peak system power may exceed total 
power available from adapter and battery. Typical indicators 
of such overload are system voltage drops or reaching the 
adapter or battery (discharge) maximum currents. These 
events are observed by the processor hot function in the 
device that sends an nPROCHOT pulse to CPU, asking for 
load reduction. The monitored events are: 
1. ICRIT: Adapter peak current reaches 110% of ILIM2. 
2. INOM: Adapter average current reaches 110% of input 
current limit (ILIM1). 
3. IDCHG: Battery discharge current reaches its programmed 
nPROCHOT threshold value. (IDCHG > IDCHG_VTH with 
tIDCHG_DEG deglitch). 
4. VSYS: System voltage on VSYS reaches its programmed 
nPROCHOT threshold value. (VSYS < VSYS_TH2 when 
EN_CON_VAP bit = 0 or VVBUS < VVBUS_CONVENZ when 
EN_CON_VAP bit = 1). 
5. Adapter removal: Upon adapter removal that results in 
CHRG_OK pin to go low when VVBUS < VVBUS_CONVENZ. 
6. Battery removal: Upon battery removal that results in 
CELL_BATPRESZ pin to go low. 
7. CMPOUT: Independent comparator output (CMPOUT pin) 
goes from high to low. 
8. VDPM: VBUS falls below 80% or 90% (by PROCHOT_ 
VDPM_80_90 register) or 100% (LOWER_PROCHOT_ 
VDPM register) of the VINDPM threshold. 
9. EXIT_VAP: The charger exits VAP mode.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
The thresholds for the IDCHG, ICRIT, VSYS, VDPM events, and 
the deglitch times of the IDCHG, ICRIT, INOM or CMPOUT events 
are I2C programmable. Triggering by each event is 
individually enabled or disabled in ProchotOption1[7:0] bits 
(I2C address = 0x38) except for the PROCHOT_EXIT_VAP 
which is always enabled. If any enabled event is triggered, a 
low 
pulse 
with 
minimum 
width 
programmable 
in 
PROCHOT_WIDTH[1:0] bits is generated on nPROCHOT. If 
the event is still active at the end of the pulse, nPROCHOT 
will still be low until the event is cleared. 
By enabling nPROCHOT pulse extension mode (set 
EN_PROCHOT_EXT bit = 1), the nPROCHOT output 
remains low until the host writes a 0 to PROCHOT_CLEAR 
bit even if the triggering event is already cleared. For the 
STAT_VDPM and STAT_EXIT_VAP events trigged, the 
nPROCHOT output will be low until the host writes 
STAT_VDPM or STAT_EXIT_VAP to clear the event, 
independent of EN_PROCHOT_EXT bit. 
 
nPROCHOT during Low Power Mode 
The device provides a low power nPROCHOT function with 
very low quiescent current consumption if the device is in low 
power mode (EN_LWPWR bit = 1). In this mode, the 
independent comparator is used for system voltage 
monitoring, and sends an nPROCHOT signal to CPU if an 
overload condition occurs. The independent comparator 
threshold is always 1.2V. The register settings needed to 
enable nPROCHOT system voltage monitoring in low power 
mode are as follows: 
• EN_LWPWR bit = 1 (enable charger low power mode). 
• ProchotOption1[7:0] bits (I2C address = 0x38) = 0x40. 
• ChargeOption1[6:4] bits (I2C address = 0x30) = 0b100. 
• Independent comparator threshold is always 1.2V. 
• When EN_PROCHOT_LPWR bit = 1, the charger can 
monitor the system voltage by connecting CMPIN pin to a 
voltage proportional to system. The nPROCHOT will be 
pulled from high to low when CMPIN voltage (which is 
proportional to system voltage) falls below 1.2V to indicate an 
overload condition occurs. 
 
nPROCHOT Status 
The event that has triggered nPROCHOT sets the 
corresponding bit in ProchotStatus[7:0] bits (I2C address = 
0x22) and STAT_EXIT_VAP bit. This status bit (except 
STAT_VDPM and STAT_EXIT_VAP bits) can be reset to 0 if 
it is not active anymore after being read by the host. The 
STAT_VDPM and STAT_EXIT_VAP bits can be reset to 0 
after the host writes the corresponding bit to 0. 
If an nPROCHOT event occurs while another event is active, 
both status bits will be 1. The nPROCHOT pulse will be 
extended if one of the events is still active after the normal 
nPROCHOT pulse width.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Device Protection 
Watchdog Timer 
An internal watchdog timer can terminate the charging if in a 
153s window (selectable in WDTMR_ADJ[1:0] bits), a write to 
MaxChargeVoltage register or ChargeCurrent register does 
not occur. Except ChargeCurrent register, which is reset to 
zero and suspends battery charging, the other registers are 
not changed after watchdog timeout. Therefore, within each 
watchdog cycle, at least one write to MaxChargeVoltage 
register or ChargeCurrent register is necessary to reset 
watchdog timer and continue (or resume) charging if the 
values are valid. The watchdog timer can be disabled by 
writing 00 to WDTMR_ADJ[1:0] bits. 
 
Input Over-Voltage Protection (ACOV) 
The device has a fixed input over-voltage threshold (the input 
is conventionally called AC adapter). If VVBUS exceeds ACOV 
threshold, it is considered as adapter over-voltage. An ACOV 
event disables the converter and pulls the CHRG_OK low. 
BATFET will turn on while VSYS drops below VBAT. When 
VVBUS returns below ACOV (adapter back to normal voltage), 
the CHRG_OK will be released to go high again and the 
converter automatically resumes if the other enable 
conditions are valid. 
 
Input Over-Current Protection (ACOC) 
If the input current exceeds the ACOC threshold, the 
converter stops switching. It will retry switching after 250ms. 
The ACOC is set by ILIM2_VTH (ILIM2_VTH[4:0] bits) multiplied 
by 1.33 or 2 (ACOC_VTH register). 
 
System Over-Voltage Protection (SYSOVP) 
After the converter starts, the CELL_BATPRESZ pin is read 
to set the MaxChargeVoltage register. It also sets the 
SYSOVP threshold to 5V (1-cell battery), or 12V (2-cell 
battery) or 19.4V (3-cell or 4-cell battery). Before the host 
writes 
to 
MaxChargeVoltage 
register, 
the 
battery 
configuration is set by CELL pin voltage. If a system 
over-voltage occurs, the converter will be latched off and 
SYSOVP_STAT = 1. The latch off can be cleared to restart 
the converter by writing 0 to this bit or by adapter 
remove-reconnect.  
 
Battery Over-Voltage Protection (BATOVP) 
A battery over-voltage may occur by inserting a wrong battery 
or due to removal of the battery during charge. Battery 
over-voltage threshold is 104% (2-4 cells battery) of the 
regulation voltage (MaxChargeVoltage register). In case of a 
BATOVP, the Buck-Boost stops switching and the VSYS pin 
starts to sink current until VBAT falls below 102% of the 
regulation voltage (MaxChargeVoltage register). 
 
Battery Short 
If VBAT drops below VSYSMIN voltage during charging, the 
maximum current will be limited to 384mA. 
 
System Short Hiccup Mode 
The system voltage (VSYS) is constantly monitored and if it 
falls below 2.4V, it enters SYS short with maximum IINDPM = 
500mA. And after a 2ms deglitch time, the charger shuts 
down for 500ms and then restarts for 10ms. If the VSYS is still 
below 2.4V, the shutdown will repeat. This hiccup mode will 
continue until the restarts fail 7 times in 90 second and the 
charger will latch off if the short is still present. The Fault 
SYS_SHORT bit will be set to 1 to indicate system short fault. 
The charger can be re-enabled only by writing 0 to Fault 
SYS_SHORT bit. The charger system short hiccup mode can 
be disabled by writing SYS_SHORT_DISABLE bit = 1. 
 
Battery Discharge Over-Current (BATOC) 
The battery discharging current (IBAT) is constantly monitored, 
and if IBAT > IBAT_OC, the BATOC is triggered. After BATOC, 
the Buck-Boost stops switching and the Fault BATOC bit will 
be set to 1 to indicate the battery over-current. 
During OTG/VAP, whether it exits OTG/VAP after BATOC 
automatically is described as follows: 
1. If it is in OTG mode and VBAT > VSYSMIN, OTG doesn't exit, 
and the BUS_UVP function (refer to BUS UVP in OTG/VAP 
mode) is disabled. When IBAT < IBAT_OC, it resumes switching, 
and BUS_UVP function is enabled again. 
2. Otherwise, it exits OTG (by setting EN_OTG bit to 0) or 
VAP (by setting OTG_VAP_MODE = 1) automatically. 
The threshold of BATOC is set in BATOC_VTH register as 
ratio of IDCHG_VTH[5:0] and the minimum value of BATOC 
is 10A. The BATOC function can be disabled by writing 
EN_BATOC bit = 0.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Bus Over-Voltage Protection (BUS OVP) in 
OTG/VAP Mode 
During OTG/VAP, when VVBUS > 110% OTGVoltage register, 
the BUS OVP is triggered. In case of a BUS OVP, the 
Buck-Boost stops switching and the VBUS pin starts to sink 
current. Fault_OTG_OVP bit = 1 indicates BUS over-voltage 
fault. In OTG mode, if VBUS OV exceeds 10ms, it exits OTG 
(by setting EN_OTG bit to 0) automatically.  
 
Bus Under-Voltage Protection (BUS UVP) in 
OTG/VAP Mode 
During OTG/VAP, OTG output current is limited in 
OTGCurrent register, when the BUS load is heavier than the 
current limit, VVBUS voltage decreases. When VVBUS < 85% 
OTGVoltage 
register, 
OTG 
BUS 
UVP 
is 
triggered. 
Fault_OTG_UVP bit = 1 indicates BUS under-voltage fault. 
For OTG mode, if the BUS UV condition lasts for 7ms deglitch 
(for OTG startup, the BUS UVP deglitch time is 400ms), it 
exits OTG (by setting EN_OTG bit to 0) automatically. For 
VAP mode, during VBUS charging, if VVBUS < 2.4V for 7ms, it 
exits 
VAP 
(by 
setting 
OTG_VAP_MODE 
bit 
= 
1) 
automatically. 
 
Thermal Shutdown (TSHUT) 
The device uses a TQFN package with low thermal 
impedance and excellent junction to ambient thermal 
conduction. If the junction temperature (TJ) exceeds +155℃, 
the converter will shut down. The device resumes its normal 
operation (with soft-start) when TJ returns below +135℃. 
 
Device Functional Modes 
Forward Mode 
When a qualified input source is connected to VBUS, the 
device is in the forward mode, regulates the system output 
and charges the battery. 
 
System Voltage Regulation with Narrow VDC Architecture 
The SGM41573 is an NVDC charger and uses the external 
P-type BATFET transistor to separate the system bus and 
battery. Using BATFET, the VSYS can be regulated above the 
minimum system voltage (VSYSMIN is set in MinSystemVoltage 
register) even if the battery is fully depleted. If VBAT is below 
VSYSMIN, the BATFET will operate in linear mode (LDO mode) 
and as VBAT rises, it gradually goes to full-ON state when VBAT 
reaches VSYSMIN. The BATFET is fully ON in charge and 
supplement modes so VBAT ≈ VSYS (the difference is only the 
VDS of the BATFET). Normally, the VSYS is regulated to 
160mV + VBAT when BATFET is off (not in charging or 
supplement modes). 
Refer to the System Voltage Regulation section for more 
details about system voltage regulation and how it is 
programmed. 
 
Battery Charging Control 
The device can charge 1-cell to 4-cell batteries with constant 
current (CC) and constant voltage (CV) modes. The 
CELL_BATPREZ pin voltage setting is read to set the default 
battery voltage (4.2V/cell) in MaxChargeVoltage register. 
Depending on the battery capacity, the host should program 
proper charge current in ChargeCurrent register. If the battery 
is fully charged or if it is not in proper charge condition, the 
host can terminate the charge by setting CHRG_INHIBIT bit = 
1 or clearing ChargeCurrent register. 
 
USB On-The-Go 
The USB OTG function is supported, and the device can send 
power from the battery to another portable device connected 
to the USB port (reverse mode). The OTG mode voltage is 
USB PD compliant and includes 5V, 9V, 15V, and 20V 
outputs. The output current is also USB type-C compliant and 
includes 500mA, 1.5A, 3A and 5A currents. Similar to the 
forward mode, in the OTG mode, the converter can also 
switches from PWM to pulse skip mode at light loads for 
efficiency improvement. 
 
Pass Through Mode (PTM) 
In the pass through mode, the upper switches of the 
Buck-Boost are on, and the lower ones are off, connecting the 
system directly to the source through the upper switches. This 
mode is used in light load or when the system is in the sleep 
mode to minimize losses. The switching and inductor core 
losses are avoided in PTM mode. 
The following settings are needed to transfer charger to PTM 
from normal Buck-Boost operation: 
• Set EN_EXTILIM bit = 0, to disable the EN_EXTILIM. 
• Set PTM_PINSEL bit = 1. 
• Set EN_PTM bit = 1. 
• Ground ILIM_HIZ pin. 
To leave PTM mode, set EN_PTM bit = 0 or pull ILIM_HIZ 
high. 
The device exits PTM automatically if any of conditions below 
is triggered: 
1. ACOC 
2. TSHUT 
3. BATOC 
4. BATOV 
5. VINDPM

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Programming 
I2C Write-Word or Read-Word charger protocol commands 
are supported by SGM41573. The charger can be identified 
by the ManufacturerID and DeviceID. The ManufacturerID 
always returns 0x07. And the I2C address is 6BH. 
 
I2C Serial Interface and Data Communication 
Standard I2C interface is used to program SGM41573 
parameters and get status reports. I2C is well known 2-wire 
serial communication interface that can connect one (or more) 
master device(s) to some slave devices for two-way 
communication. The bus lines are named serial data (SDA) 
and serial clock (SCL). The device that initiates a data 
transfer is a master. A master generates the SCL signal. 
Slave devices have unique addresses to identify. A master is 
typically a micro controller or a digital signal processor. 
The SGM41573 operates as a slave device that address is 
0x6B (6BH). It has forty-five 8-bit registers, numbered from 
REG0x00 to REG0x3C.  
 
Physical Layer 
The standard I2C interface of SGM41573 supports standard 
mode and fast mode communication speeds. The frequency 
of stand mode is up to 100kbits/s, while the fast mode is up to 
400kbits/s. Bus lines are pulled high by weak current source 
or pull-up resistors and are in logic high state with no clocking 
when the bus is free. The SDA and SCL pins are open-drain. 
 
I2C Data Communication 
START and STOP Conditions 
A transaction is started by taking control of the bus by master 
if the bus is free. The transaction is terminated by releasing 
the bus when the data transfer job is done as shown in Figure 
6. All transactions begin by the master which applies a 
START condition on the bus lines to take over the bus and 
exchange data. At the end, the master terminates the 
transaction by applying one (or more) STOP condition. 
START condition is generated by master when SCL is high 
and a high to low transition on the SDA. Similarly, a STOP is 
defined when SCL is high and SDA goes from low to high. 
START and STOP are always generated by a master. After a 
START and before a STOP the bus is considered to be busy. 
 
 
 
Figure 6. I2C Bus in START and STOP Conditions 
 
Data Bit Transmission and Validity 
Data bit (high or low) must remain stable during clock HIGH 
period. The state of SDA only can change when SCL is LOW. 
For each data bit transmission, one clock pulse is generated 
by the master. Bit transfer in I2C is shown in Figure 7. 
 
 
Figure 7. I2C Bus Bit Transfer 
 
Byte Format 
Data is transmitted in 8-bit packets (one byte at a time). The 
number of bytes in one transaction is not limited. In each 
packet, the 8 bits are sent successively with the Most 
Significant 
Bit 
(MSB) 
first. 
An 
acknowledge 
(or 
not-acknowledge) bit must come after the 8 data bits. This bit 
informs the transmitter whether the receiver is ready to 
proceed for the next byte or not. If the slave is busy and 
cannot transfer another byte of data, it can hold the SCL line 
low and keep the master in a wait state (called clock 
stretching). When the slave is ready for another byte of data, 
it releases the clock line and data transfer can continue with 
clocks generated by master. Figure 8 shows the byte transfer 
process with I2C interface.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Acknowledge (ACK) and Not Acknowledge (NCK) 
After transmission of each byte by transmitter, an 
acknowledge bit is replied by the receiver as the ninth bit. 
With the acknowledge bit, the receiver informs the transmitter 
that the byte is received, and another byte is expected or can 
be sent (ACK) or it is not expected (NCK = not ACK). Clock 
(SCL) is always generated by the master, including for the 
acknowledge clock pulse, no matter who is acting as 
transmitter or receiver. SDA line is released for receiver 
control during the acknowledge clock pulse. And the receiver 
can pull the SDA line low as ACK (reply a 0 bit) or let it be high 
as NCK during the SCL high pulse. After that, the master can 
either STOP (P) to end the transaction or send a new START 
(S) condition to start a new transfer (called repeated start). 
For example, when master wants to read a register in slave, 
one start is needed to send the slave address and register 
address, and then, without a STOP condition, another start is 
sent by master to initiate the receiving transaction from slave. 
Master then sends the STOP condition and releases the bus. 
 
Data Direction Bit and Addressing Slaves 
The first byte sent by master after the START is always the 
target slave address (7 bits) and the eighth data-direction bit 
(R/W). R/W bit is 0 for a WRITE transaction and 1 for READ 
(when master is asking for data). Data direction is the same 
for all next bytes of the transaction. To reverse it, a new 
START or repeated START condition must be sent by master 
(STOP will end the transaction). Usually the second byte is a 
WRITE sending the register address that is supposed to be 
an access in the next byte(s). The data transfer transaction is 
shown in Figure 9. 
WRITE: If the master wants to write in the register, the third 
byte can be written directly as shown in Figure 10 for a single 
write data transfer. After receiving the ACK, master may issue 
a STOP condition to end the transaction or send the next 
register data, which will be written to the next address in a 
slave as multi-write. A STOP is needed after sending the last 
data.  
READ: If the master wants to read a single register (Figure 
11), it sends a new START condition along with device 
address with R/W bit = 1. After ACK is received, master reads 
the SDA line to receive the content of the register. Master 
replies with NCK to inform slave that no more data is needed 
(single read) or it can send an ACK to request for sending the 
next register content (multi-read). This can continue until a 
NCK is sent by master. A STOP must be sent by master in 
any case to end the transaction.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Data Transactions with Multi-Read or Multi-Write 
Multi-read and multi-write are supported by SGM41573, as 
explained in Figure 12 and Figure 13. In the multi-write, every 
new data byte sent by master is written to the next register of 
the device. A STOP is sent whenever master is done with 
writing into device registers. 
In a multi-read transaction, after receiving the first register 
data (its address is already written to the slave), the master 
replies with an ACK to ask the slave for sending the next 
register data. This can continue as much as it is needed by 
master. Master sends back an NCK after the last received 
byte and issues a STOP condition.

Write 2-Byte I2C Commands 
There are some I2C commands combine two 8-bit registers 
together to form a complete value. These commands include: 
• ChargeCurrent() 
• MaxChargeVoltage() 
• IIN_DPM() 
• OTGVoltage() 
• InputVoltage() 
The host must write the LSB command first and then the MSB 
command. If the MSB is written first or if the other command 
(not the MSB) is written after LSB command, this command is 
ignored. After the LSB command is written, the MSB 
command must be written within the watchdog time. 
Otherwise, this command is ignored. Both bytes will be 
updated simultaneously when the LSB and MSB bytes are 
properly written.

ChargeCurrent Register 
Charge current is set in ChargeCurrent register (REG0x03/02). 
When a 10mΩ sense resistor is used, the charge current range is 
64mA to 8.128A with 64mA resolution.  
The ChargeCurrent register will be set to 0A when: 
1. Auto wakeup is not active after POR. 
2. The CELL_BATPRESZ goes low. 
3. Write MaxChargeVoltage register to 0. 
4. Adapter plugs out. 
5. Watchdog timer out. 
The default current sense resistor RSR between SRP and 
SRN is 10mΩ, other value resistor can also be used. Larger 
sense resistor will increase the regulation accuracy but 
increase the conduction loss at the same time, thus values 
above 20mΩ are not recommended. 
 
Battery Pre-Charge Current Clamp 
In pre-charge, BATFET operates in linear (LDO) mode when 
EN_LDO bit = 1. For 2-cell/3-cell/4-cell battery, VSYS voltage 
is regulated at minimum system voltage and the maximum 
pre-charge current is 384mA. For 1-cell battery, the 
pre-charge current is clamped at 384mA. When VBAT is 
above 3V but below minimum system voltage, the BATFET 
operates in LDO mode and the charge current is clamped at 
2A.

Charge voltage is set in MaxChargeVoltage register 
(REG0x05/04). The charge voltage range is 1.024V to 
19.200V with 8mV resolution.  
The MaxChargeVoltage register is set to 4200mV for 1-cell, 
8400mV for 2-cell, 12600mV for 3-cell or 16800mV for 4-cell 
by default. After CHRG_OK goes high, the charge will start 
depending on the charge current setting in ChargeCurrent 
register and the charge voltage setting in MaxChargeVoltage 
register. MaxChargeVoltage register needs to be set before 
ChargeCurrent register for correct battery voltage setting if 
battery 
voltage 
is 
different 
from 
4.2V/cell. 
Writing 
MaxChargeVoltage register to 0 will set MaxChargeVoltage 
register 
to 
the 
corresponding 
value 
depending 
on 
CELL_BATPRESZ pin (refer to Battery Cell Configuration 
section). 
The battery voltage is sensed on SRN pin for regulation, and 
the battery should be placed as close to SRN pin as possible.

MinSystemVoltage Register 
The minimum system voltage is set in MinSystemVoltage 
register (REG0x0D/0C). The minimum system voltage range 
is 1.024V to 16.128V with 256mV resolution. Any 
out-of-range write is ignored. The MinSystemVoltage register 
is set to 3.584V for 1-cell, 6.144V for 2-cell, 9.216V for 3-cell, 
and 12.288V for 4-cell by default. Writing MinSystemVoltage 
register to 0 will set MinSystemVoltage register to the 
corresponding value depending on CELL_BATPRESZ pin 
(refer to Battery Cell Configuration section). 
 
System Voltage Regulation 
The system is separated from battery by BATFET, and the 
system is regulated above the minimum system voltage 
setting in MinSystemVoltage register even if the battery is 
completely depleted or removed.  
The BATFET is in LDO mode and the system is regulated 
above VSYSMIN when the battery voltage is below VSYSMIN. 
When the battery voltage is above VSYSMIN, the BATFET is 
fully on (during charge or in the supplement mode) and the 
system voltage is regulated at battery voltage plus the VDS of 
BATFET. The BATFET is off and the system voltage is 
regulated at battery voltage plus about 180mV when the 
charge is disabled or no supplement mode. 
VSYS is shorted to SRP if BATFET is removed. At this 
condition, LDO mode must be disabled before starting 
converter. Follow the sequence below to configure charger. 
1. Before the adapter is plugged in, set the charger into HIZ 
mode by pulling ILIM_HIZ pin to ground or setting EN_HIZ bit 
to 1. 
2. Disable LDO mode by setting EN_LDO bit to 0. 
3. Disable auto-wakeup mode by setting AUTO_WAKEUP_EN bit 
to 0. 
4. Make sure the battery voltage is set properly in 
MaxChargeVoltage register. 
5. Set pre-charge/charge current in ChargeCurrent register. 
6. Exit HIZ mode by releasing ILIM_HIZ from ground and set 
EN_HIZ bit to 0. 
When exiting HIZ mode, the low input current limit (a few 
hundred milliamps) should be set to avoid accidental SW 
mistakes.

REGISTER AND DATA (continued) 
Input Current and Input Voltage Registers 
for Dynamic Power Management 
The SGM41573 features dynamic power management (DPM). 
When the input current tries to exceed the input current limits 
or the input voltage tends to fall below the input voltage limit, 
the device gives priority to provide system load by reducing 
the battery charge current adequately to avoid the input 
parameter (voltage or current) exceeding the limit. 
If the charge current is decreased and reached to zero, but 
the input is still overloaded, the system voltage starts to drop 
with the system load rising. When the system voltage drops 
below the battery voltage, the device operates in the 
supplement mode and the battery provides a portion of 
system power demand through BATFET. 
 
Input Current Limit Registers 
The input current limit is set in IIN_HOST register 
(REG0x0F/0E). With a 10mΩ sense resistor, the input current 
limit range is 50mA to 6350mA with 50mA resolution. The 
default input current limit is 3.25A. The input current limit is 
reset to the default value when the adapter is removed, and 
the input current limit is 50mA when the IIN_HOST register 
code is set to 0. 
The default current sense resistor RAC between ACP and 
ACN is 10mΩ, the other value resistor such as 20mΩ can 
also be used. Larger sense resistor will increase the 
regulation accuracy, but will increase the conduction loss at 
the same time. 
External input current limit can be set by ILIM_HIZ pin voltage 
using the following equation, in which IDPM is the target input 
current limit. 
 
VILIM_HIZ = 1V + 40 × (VACP - VACN) = 1+ 40 × IDPM × RAC (2) 
Writing EN_EXTILIM bit to 0 or pulling ILIM_HIZ pin above 
4.0V can disable ILIM_HIZ pin.

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
The SGM41573 is a synchronous Buck-Boost battery charge 
controller with NVDC power path management. It is typically 
used as a charger controller with portable applications such 
as notebooks, tablets and other mobile devices with 
rechargeable batteries. 
 
Design Requirements 
Table 50 provides a list of requirements for a typical 
application design. Input voltage and current are specified 
based on the adapter specifications and minimum system 
voltage. Battery charge voltage and charge current are 
determined based on the battery specifications.

Detailed Design Procedure 
Many parameters such as charging current and voltage can 
be configured by the software. Figure 2 shows a simplified 
application circuit. Inductor, capacitor, and MOSFET are 
essential for the converter. 
 
ACP-ACN Input Filter 
Because the SGM41573 uses average current mode control, 
proper sensing of the input current is critical to recover the 
inductor current ripple. This current is sensed by the 
differential voltage between ACP and ACN across RAC 
resistor. Parasitic inductances over the shunt and PCB 
connections must be avoided because they cause high 
frequency ringing on ACP-ACN and deteriorate the sensed 
current. Large parasitic inductance can also cause current 
loop instability. The filter suggested in Figure 14 can be used 
to remove such parasitic noises. Insignificant delays would 
not deteriorate the loop stability. 
 
Inductor Selection 
Two fixed switching frequencies (fS) can be selected. Choose 
the higher one to reduce the inductor and capacitors values. 
Select the inductor saturation current larger than maximum 
charging current (ICHG, plus system current if there is any 
system load) plus half the peak-to-peak ripple current 
(IRIPPLE_BUCK) for the Buck mode: 
 
ISAT ≥ ICHG + (1/2) IRIPPLE_BUCK 
(3) 
Select the inductor saturation current which is larger than the 
maximum input current plus half the peak-to-peak ripple 
current (IRIPPLE_BOOST) for the Boost mode: 
 
ISAT ≥ IIN + (1/2) IRIPPLE_BOOST

APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued) 
In Buck mode, the maximum ripple current occurs around D = 
0.5. For example, for a 3-cell battery, the charging voltage 
range is 9V to 12.6V and if a 20V adapter voltage is applied, 
the inductor current ripple is maximum when the battery 
voltage is around 10V. For a 4-cell battery (12V to 16.8V 
voltage range), when battery voltage is 12V, the inductor 
ripple current is at its maximum. 
Typically the inductance is selected such that the ripple is 
within 20% to 40% of the maximum charging current for a 
tradeoff between the inductor losses and its dimensions. 
 
Input Capacitor 
The input capacitor must tolerate the inductor ripple current. 
With a pulse current duty cycle of D and the DC charging 
current of ICHG (plus system current if there is any system 
load), the RMS current can be estimated of the Buck mode by 
Equation 6:

Use low ESR ceramic capacitor (X7R or X5R etc.) for input 
decoupling and place them before current sense resistor and 
as close as possible to the power stage. The capacitance 
between the RAC (current sense resistor) and the power stage 
should not be too large. Otherwise, the ripple information of 
the inductor current will be distorted. Consider ceramic 
capacitor (MLCC) DC bias voltage derating (which may leads 
significant capacitance drop) of the capacitors for choosing 
their rated voltage. Tantalum capacitors (POSCAP) can avoid 
DC bias effect and temperature variation effect which is 
recommended for higher power application. 
In addition, the input capacitor of the system in OTG mode is 
changed to the output capacitance of OTG. It should also be 
considered that the input capacitance can affect the output 
voltage ripple and transient response in OTG mode. 
 
Output Capacitor 
The output capacitor (on the system) must have enough RMS 
current rating to carry the inductor switching ripple and 
provides enough energy for system transient current 
demands. For the Buck mode, ICOUT (COUT RMS current) can 
be calculated by:

For the best stability, place at least a 10μF/0805 capacitor 
after the charge current sense resistor (RSR). 
 
Power MOSFETs Selection 
Four N-channel MOSFETs are needed for the charger's 
synchronous switching converter along with one P-channel 
MOSFET for BATFET. The internal gate drivers provide 6V 
drive voltage. Choose 30V or higher rated MOSFETs for 19V 
~ 20V input voltage. 
To tradeoff between conduction and switching losses, the 
figure-of-merit (FOM) is a common parameter used for switch 
comparison. The FOM is defined as the product of the 
MOSFETs RDS(ON) to its gate-to-drain charge, and QGD is for 
top-side switches. The RDS(ON) times total gate charge, and 
QG is for the bottom-side switches. 
 
FOMTOP = RDS(ON) × QGD; FOMBOTTOM = RDS(ON) × QG (12) 
A lower FOM value shows smaller total loss. Switches with 
lower RDS(ON) in the same package are usually more 
expensive. 
The top-side MOSFET loss can be calculated as (Buck 
mode):

Power Supply Recommendations 
An adapter with 3.58V to 24V voltage which is capable to 
provide at least 500mA can be used with this device. 
CHRG_OK = HIGH shows that adapter is powering the 
system through the charger. If the adapter is removed, the 
system will connect to the battery through BATFET. Usually, 
the battery depletion threshold is larger than the minimum 
system voltage setting such that full battery capacity can be 
utilized. 
 
Layout Guidelines 
A good layout is critical for proper performance of a switching 
charger. To reduce the switching losses, the hard switching 
rise and fall times of the switching nodes should be minimized. 
Also, to reduce electric and magnetic couplings and noise 
radiation from the high frequency path, the loop area and 
conductor surfaces must be minimized. 
A list of PCB layout guidelines is given below. It is important 
to prioritize these guidelines in the as ordered in this list. 
1. Place the input capacitor right on the supply and ground 
connection points of switching legs and on the same layer 
with the switches. Avoid vias in the high frequency current 
paths if possible. 
2. Keep the device close to the switch gate pins to minimize 
gate drive trace lengths. The device can be placed on the 
opposite side of the PCB. Connect the gates with some 
parallel vias to minimize gate connection impedance. 
3. Place the inductor pins as close as possible to the 
switching nodes. Keep the switching node connections short 
and wide with minimal copper area to minimize capacitive 
coupling noise and radiation. Do not use multiple traces in 
parallel layers. Try to minimize parasitic capacitance from this 
area to any other trace or plane, especially the sensitive 
analog signal traces. 
4. Place the charge current sense resistor right next to the 
inductor output. Use kelvin contact to connect the sense 
traces across the shunt resistor and keep both traces on the 
same layer, close to each other and away from high current 
paths. Place a decoupling capacitor between sense lines just 
before reaching the device. 
5. Place one of the output capacitors next to the battery 
sensing resistor and ground. 
6. Connect the ground returns of the input and output 
capacitors together and then connect them to the system 
ground to minimize high frequency current loop areas and 
path length. 
7. Connect the charger power and analog grounds only at 
one point just beneath the device (thermal pad). Pour analog 
ground copper planes but keep them away from power pins to 
minimize inductive and capacitive noise coupling. 
8. Use separate routes for analog and power grounds. 
Connect analog and power grounds at one point on the 
thermal pad or use a 0Ω resistor as connection to separate 
analog and power ground nets in the layout. In this case, tie 
the thermal pad to the analog ground if possible. 
9. Always place the decoupling capacitors right next to the 
device pins with the shortest possible traces. 
10. It is important to solder the device thermal pad and use 
proper thermal vias to conduct the heat to the backside 
ground plane of the board for cooling. 
11. Choose proper size and quantity of vias in each current 
path.
