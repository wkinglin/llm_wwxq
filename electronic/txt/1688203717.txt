GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM862 family is a high-accuracy, low-power, and 
small size dual-channel voltage detector which can 
monitor two power rails respectively. 
SENSEx is the input pin which can be programmed with 
an external resistor divider. There are four different 
hysteresis options of 0.6%, 1%, 5% or 10%. 
OUTx is the open-drain corresponding output of SENSEx. 
OUTx goes low when the input voltage of SENSEx is 
lower than the falling threshold (VIT-). OUTx goes high 
when the input voltage of SENSEx is higher than the 
rising threshold (VIT+). The internal hysteresis of SENSEx 
has glitch immunity and ensures stable operation. 
The device has low quiescent current of 1.1µA (TYP), 
high accuracy and small size, which is particularly suitable 
for system-monitoring of low power and portable 
equipment. 
The SGM862 is available in Green UTDFN-1.45×1-6AL 
and SOT-23-6 packages.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

pulled up to 6.5V independently of VDD through a pull-up resistor. When the 
input voltage of SENSE2 falls below the falling threshold VIT-, OUT2 is driven

OUT1 
Voltage Monitor Output 1 for SENSE 1. It is an open-drain output that can be 
pulled up to 6.5V independently of VDD through a pull-up resistor. When the 
input voltage of SENSE1 falls below the falling threshold VIT-, OUT1 is driven 
low. When the input voltage of SENSE1 exceeds the rising threshold VIT+,

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
Overview 
The SGM862 family is a high-accuracy, low-power, and 
small size dual-channel voltage detector with open-drain 
output. 
SENSEx is the input pin which can be programmed with 
an external resistor divider. There are four different 
hysteresis options of 0.6%, 1%, 5% or 10%. As shown in 
Table 1, OUTx goes low when the input voltage of 
SENSEx is lower than the falling threshold (VIT-). OUTx 
goes high when the input voltage of SENSEx is higher 
than the rising threshold (VIT+). The internal hysteresis of 
SENSEx has glitch immunity and ensures stable 
operation. 
The device can be used to monitor multiple voltage rails 
in applications or simultaneously monitor both early 
warning signal channel and reset signal channel in one 
system.

Inputs (SENSE1, SENSE2) 
The SGM862 has two voltage detection comparators. 
The comparator input voltage is from 0V to 6.5V, which 
is independent of the device power supply voltage used. 
The no-inverting input of the comparator is connected 
to the external resistor divider. The inverting input of the 
comparator is connected to an internal threshold 
reference. When SENSEx voltage drops below VIT-, the 
corresponding OUTx is driven low. When SENSEx 
voltage rises above VIT+, the corresponding OUTx is 
driven high. The hysteresis falling threshold prevents 
the comparator from being falsely triggered, and 
ensures stable operation. 
In situations with extremely high noise and interference, 
it is recommended to place a 1nF to 10nF bypass 
capacitor at the input of the comparator to improve 
transient immunity and reduce the sensitivity of layout 
parasitism. In most cases, the decoupling capacitance 
is not required. See Figure 2 for more details. 
 
Outputs (OUT1, OUT2) 
The SGM862 is usually used in reset or power 
sequencing circuit, where the output is connected to 
the digital signal processor (DSP), microcontroller (µC), 
microprocessor (CPU) and so on, or the output is 
connected to the DC/DC or LDO enable terminal to 
enable or disable the power converter. 
OUT1 and OUT2 are two open-drain outputs of 
SGM862. A pull-up resistor is needed to connect a 
voltage rail, which can be up to 6.5V and is 
independent of the device power supply voltage (VDD). 
To choose a proper pull-up resistor, users should 
consider low-level output voltage (VOL), sink current 
capability and output leakage current (ILKG_OD). The 
open-drain output is convenient for the logic level 
compatibility. Another advantage of open-drain output 
is to implement wired and logic easily. OUT1 and OUT2 
can be combined into one logic signal. The input 
(SENSE1, SENSE2) section has described how to 
assert or desserts the output. 
 
Device Functional Modes 
Normal Operation (VDD ≥ VDD_MIN) 
Once the voltage on VDD rises above VDD_MIN and lasts 
for tSD, the OUTx starts to indicate the present state of 
corresponding SENSEx pins. 
 
Power-On Reset (VDD < VPOR) 
Once the voltage on VDD is below VPOR which is the 
required voltage to pull the output to GND, the OUTx is 
undefined and unreliable for proper system operation.

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
The SGM862 family is a dual-voltage detector with high 
accuracy. The monitored voltage, VDD voltage and 
output pull-up voltage can be flexibly used as 
independent voltages or connected to any other 
configuration. 
 
Threshold Overdrive 
Threshold overdrive is how much SENSEx exceeds the 
threshold VIT, which is important to know because the 
larger the overdrive is, the faster the OUTX responses. 
VIT is the threshold voltage in Equation 1. Use the 
percent of the sense voltage threshold to calculate the 
threshold overdrive. 
Overdrive = | (VSENSE/VIT - 1) × 100% |    (1) 
VIT is VIT- when caculating the negative-going threshold 
overdrive. VIT is VIT+ when caculating the positive-going 
threshold overdrive. 
 
Sense Resistor Divider 
Use Equation 2 to caculate the resistor divider values, 
which determines VMON_UV. Use Equation 3 to caculate 
the target threshold voltage, which determines VMON_PG.

SENSEx pins: 
R1 is the upper divider resistor. R2 is the lower divider 
resistor. 
VMON_UV is the target voltage for monitoring the 
under-voltage. 
VMON_PG is the target voltage that monitors the output 
goes high during VMONx rises. 
Selecting the total resistance values of R1 and R2 
determines that the current flowing through the divider 
about 100 times higher than the SENSEx input current. 
Meanwhile, choose the resistors values as high as 
possible to minimize current consumption which will not 
bring about obvious error to the resistance divider. 
 
Power-Supply Recommendations 
The input supply voltage of SGM862 ranges from 
1.65V to 6.5V. A 0.1μF or greater ceramic capacitor 
close to VDD pin is recommended. VDD pin has a 7V 
absolute maximum rating.

Detailed Design Procedure 
The SGM862D is 10% hysterisis version and chosen 
finally. An open-drain output allows for the output to be 
pulled up to a voltage other than VDD. 
Use Equation 2 and Equation 3 to calculate the resistor 
divider values. For SENSE1, R1 = 1.72MΩ and R2 = 
1.18MΩ. While R3 and R4 of SENSE2 can be caculate 
through R1 and R2 in Equation 2 and Equation 3. 
Therefore, R3 = 1.42MΩ and R4 = 1.18MΩ.

LAYOUT 
It is recommended to place the decoupling capacitor 
close to VDD, and place the bypass capacitor close to 
the SENSEx if the bypass capacitor is necessary. 
Avoid long traces to power VDD. The VDD decoupling 
capacitor and parasitic inductance from long traces 
can form LC resonance and cause ringing with peak 
voltages, which may damage the device.
