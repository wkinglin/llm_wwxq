GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM447 is a high-accuracy analog output CMOS 
integrated-circuit temperature sensor with tiny WLCSP 
package. It can operate with a supply voltage of 1.5V in 
the lowest gain configuration while measuring the 
temperature of -55℃ to +150℃. 
The SGM447 is capable of strong output source and 
sink current while driving heavy loads in that it has 
class-AB output. Therefore, it is available for sourcing the 
input of a sample-and-hold analog-to-digital converter 
requiring transient load. Without using external 
components such as resistors and buffers on the output, 
the SGM447 can deliver the output voltage inversely 
proportional to measured temperature from -55℃ to 
+150 ℃. Low supply current makes it suitable for 
application in 
general temperature sensors 
and 
battery-powered systems. 
The gain of the temperature-to-voltage output transfer 
function is set by the gain selection input (GS) pin with 
two selectable slopes, (-5.4mV/℃ at GS = 0 or -8.1mV/℃ 
at GS = 1). If the GS pin is connect to logic high, the 
transfer function will achieve the maximum temperature 
sensitivity gain. The GS pin can be connected to VDD 
or GND without any components such as pull-up or 
pull-down resistors to minimize the board area. During 
operation or system diagnostics, if the input is driven by 
a logical signal, then the system will optimize the gain. 
The SGM447 is available in a Green WLCSP-0.8×0.8- 
4B-A package. It is specified over a wide temperature 
range of -55℃ to +150℃.

NOTE: 
1. When the input voltage (VIN) at any pin exceeds power 
supplies (VIN < GND or VIN > V+), the current at that pin 
should be limited to 5mA. 
OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

NOTES: 
1. The currents flowing out of the SGM447 are source currents, and flowing into the SGM447 are sink currents. 
2. The line regulation in DC is calculated as the output voltage when the supply voltage reaches its maximum value and its 
minimum value. Also, the line regulation is not the output change which is illustrated in output voltage shift section.

APPLICATION INFORMATION (Continued) 
From the above table, although the output voltage is 
nearly linear with the change of temperature, the 
transfer function between the voltage and temperature 
is parabolic, which can reflect the accuracy of the 
SGM447. Equation 1 is the parabolic transfer function 
reflecting the output voltage in Table 1. 
G0: VTEMP (mV) = 868.6mV - 5.434mV/℃ × 
(T - 30℃) - 0.0003mV/℃ × (T - 30℃) 2           
G1: VTEMP (mV) = 1317.3mV - 8.081mV/℃ ×  
(T - 30℃) - 0.0006mV/℃ × (T - 30℃) 2        (1) 
For simplicity, the two-point equation can be easily 
calculated the output voltage for the corresponding 
temperature.

The following steps are the examples for calculating the

the corresponding value of voltage for the temperature 
which is in the range of +20℃ to +50℃ at GS = 0, the 
calculation is shown as below:

Users can approximate the needed temperature ranges 
by using the above method. 
 
Mounting and Thermal Conductivity 
The SGM447 can be easily applied to the PCB board 
like other temperature sensors. Cementing and gluing 
are also allowed. 
For conducting the thermal, the backside of the die is 
connecting to GND. However, the temperature of 
trances and lands will also affect the reading of 
temperature for the temperature sensor. 
The SGM447 can be also mounted into a sealed-end 
metal tube, dipped into a bath or screwed into a 
threaded hole in a tank. To avoid leakage and corrosion, 
it is recommended that the corresponding circuit should 
be kept dry enough. For cold temperature where 
condensation and moisture may occur, it will affect the 
operation of the SGM447 because of short circuit. To 
protect the temperature sensor from moisture, a 
printed-circuit coating can be used. 
Thermal resistance junction to ambient (θJA) can be 
approximated as the temperature rise for the power 
dissipation of SGM447. The following equation is used 
for calculating the die temperature of SGM447: 
TJ = TA + θJA × [(VDD × IQ) + (VDD - VOUT) × IL]    (6) 
where: 
IQ is the quiescent current, 
IL is the load current, 
VOUT is the output voltage, 
θJA is 122℃/W. 
For example, if the users substitute TA = +25℃, VDD = 
5.5V, IQ = 4.1μA, GS = 1, VOUT = 2.5mV, and IL = 2μA in 
the above equation, TJ will be +25.0041℃, which 
means that the temperature error due to the power 
dissipation is 0.0041℃. One way to reduce the junction 
temperature of SGM447 is to reduce the load current. 
 
Output and Noise Considerations 
Because of the structure of push-pull output stage, the 
ability of sink and source current is enhanced due to 
the low output resistance, which means that it can drive 
the dynamic loads such as Analog-to-Digital Converter 
(ADC). In some applications, the SGM447 can provide 
a current source directly to the input capacitance of an 
ADC. It can also be widely used in situations where 
strong sink and source current are required. 
Because of the ripple of the power supply, the 
supply-noise gain may have an impact on the results, 
and the output capacitance can be used to filter the 
noise. 
A 0.47μF ceramic bypass capacitor should be placed 
closely on the power supply pin to avoid interference of 
noise.

APPLICATION INFORMATION (Continued) 
Capacitive Loads 
For noisy conditions, such as driving a SAR ADC, an 
output capacitor is necessary to filter out output noise 
due to the switching input of the load. The SGM447 has 
outstanding capacitive loading capability. In Figure 2, 
the SGM447 can handle a 1100pF capacitive load. 
However, if the load capacitance is larger than 1100pF, 
a series resistor should be used to compensate for the 
SGM447 in Figure 3. If the CL value is 1.1nF to 99nF, 
the minimum value of RS should be 3kΩ. If the CL value 
is 100nF to 999nF, the minimum value of RS should be 
1.5kΩ. And if the CL value is 1µF, the minimum value of 
RS should be 800Ω. Meanwhile, if the VDD ramp rate is 
between 0.02V/µs and 5V/µs, a 1nF load capacitor is 
recommended to connect to OUT pin.

Output Voltage Shift 
The characteristic of output voltage of the SGM447 is 
linear within the proper temperature range. However, a 
slightly output shift may occur when the supply voltage 
ramps to the typical voltage range of the device. This 
phenomenon is caused by the rail to rail PMOS or 
N-MOS buffer in the output stage of the temperature 
sensor. The output voltage shift will also occur when 
VDD is 1.0V greater than VOUT. 
The output voltage shift always takes place if the 
change of output voltage or supply voltage is 
approximately equal to 200mV. This voltage shift will 
also happen if the temperature is from +5℃ to +20℃ 
and the output voltage is also monotonic. In summary, 
the data for the entire temperature range of the two 
optional gains in the electrical characteristics table 
already includes possible voltage shifts. 
 
Selectable Gains for Optimization 
The GS pin of the SGM447 can be driven by the GPIO 
pins of microcontroller or simply tied to the rails of the 
system. For low power supply system, the SGM447 can 
also measure the temperature from -55℃ to +150℃ 
with the gain of -5.4mV/℃. For large power supply 
system, the corresponding gain should be set to 
-8.1mV/℃. And if the users desire to reduce the output 
noise, selecting larger gain is a good choice (for 
example, the coupling noise at the output or 
quantization noise which is from ADC). 
Another advantage of digital selectable gains is that the 
dynamic testing of the SGM447 will be enhanced when 
operating. Users can use their host equipment 
(microcontroller) to modify the gain of temperature 
sensor to check the functionality.

Conserving Power Dissipation with Shutdown

Connection for the Input Stage of SAR ADC 
Most of the CMOS-based ADCs are integrated in 
microcontroller and have a sampling capacitor input 
structure. In addition, for charging the sampling 
capacitor of ADC, it needs the instantaneous charge 
from the output of the source. Adding an output 
capacitor (CFILT) can satisfy this requirement. For the 
size of CFILT, it depends on the sampling frequency and 
the size of sampling capacitor. However, the input 
stages of the ADCs are not exactly the same, and thus 
the conditions of charge are also different. Figure 6 is 
just one example to show what the input stage of SAR  
ADC looks like.
