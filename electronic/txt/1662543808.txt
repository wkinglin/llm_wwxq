GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM8742 is a dual, high speed, low power 
comparator, which features a fast 45ns propagation 
delay. The device is optimized for low voltage operation 
on 3V or 5V supply, and consumes only 305µA supply 
current. 
The SGM8742 supports rail-to-rail input and output 
operation. The input common mode voltage range is 
from -0.1V to (+VS) + 0.1V, and the output voltage 
swing is within 0.2V of the rails without external pull-up 
or pull-down resistor. The device can be compatible 
with CMOS and TTL logics. Any input or output pin has 
a continuous short-circuit protection to both power 
supply rails. The SGM8742 has an internal hysteresis 
for reducing comparator sensitivity to noise, even when 
the input signals move slowly. 
The SGM8742 is available in Green SOIC-8 and 
MSOP-8 packages. It is rated over the -40℃ to +85℃ 
temperature range.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

NOTES: 
1. This value is from PSRR test. 
2. This value is from PD test. For the range of common mode voltage, the maximum input common mode voltage can reach (+VS) 
+ 0.1V without any damage to SGM8742. 
3. VOS is the midway voltage for the hysteresis zone of the comparator. 
4. The input hysteresis is the gap between the upper threshold where the output of the comparator switches to high position and 
the lower threshold where the output of the comparator switches to low position. 
5. CMRR is defined over the condition of whole input common mode range.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
The SGM8742 is a dual, high speed, low power 
comparator with internal hysteresis. The device is 
optimized for low voltage operation from 2.7V to 5.5V 
single supply. It supports rail-to-rail input and output 
operation. With 4mA output current, the output voltage 
swing is within 0.2V of the rails without external pull-up 
or pull-down circuitry. The SGM8742 is suitable for 
portable equipment. It can be compatible with CMOS 
and TTL logics. 
There are a lot of comparators switched frequently for 
the linear region as the effect of noise and parasitic 
parameters, and the condition of this negative situation 
is when the one input of the comparator tends to reach 
the other input voltage. In order to ease the effect of 
noise and parasitic parameter, there is a 2.8mV internal 
hysteresis inside the comparator. 
There are two trip points which are made by the 
comparator: the trip points when rising edge occurs and 
the trip points when falling edge occurs. And the gap 
between two trip points is the hysteresis of the 
comparator. The offset voltage VOS is defined as the 
average value of the two trip points. For the condition 
which two inputs of the comparator are nearly equal, 
the internal hysteresis will launch to avoid the 
frequently switching at this case. For the normal 
comparator other than SGM8742, the users usually use 
external resistors connected at +IN pin to provide 
hysteresis, while the internal hysteresis of SGM8742 
can provide internal hysteresis without any external 
component. However, if users need more hysteresis to 
reject the influence of noise or parasitic parameters, 
please add the external resistors at +IN pin to increase 
the hysteresis. 
 
 
 
Figure 1. The Waveform for Input and Output,  
Non-Inverting Input Varied 
On the condition shown in Figure 1, the -IN is fixed 
while +IN is varied, and the corresponding output is 
shown under the figure of input signal. However, if +IN 
is fixed while -IN is varied, the output will be inverted. 
 
Output Structure 
In Figure 2, the SGM8742 has a push-pull output stage. 
When output is changed from logic high/low to low/high, 
the changed sink/source current pulls/pushes output 
pin to logic low/high. Beginning this transition, larger 
sink/source current is used to create a high slew rate 
transit from high/low to low/high. Once the output 
voltage reaches VOL/VOH, it will reduce the sink/source 
current to a just right value to maintain the VOL/VOH 
static condition. This current-driven push-pull output 
stage will significantly reduce the power consumption in 
application system. 
If low slew rate transition is needed in system design, 
adjusting the load capacitance will change the slew rate. 
The heavier capacitive load will slow down the output 
voltage transition. This feature will be used to reduce 
the interference generated by fast edge of transition 
between 1 and 0 in noise-sensitive system.

Figure 4. The Application of Line Receiver 
 
Layout and Bypassing 
Good power supply decoupling, layout and grounding 
are very important for SGM8742 to realize the full 
high-speed capabilities in system, following skills will be 
used: 
 A 0.1µF to 4.7µF range ceramic capacitor is used to 
provide good power supply decoupling. This ceramic 
capacitor must be placed as close to +VS pin as 
possible. 
 For grounding, unbroken and low-inductance ground 
plane is a good choice. 
 For Layout, use short PCB trace to avoid unwanted 
parasitic feedback around the comparator. SGM8742 
must be soldered directly to the PCB and the socket is 
not recommended.
