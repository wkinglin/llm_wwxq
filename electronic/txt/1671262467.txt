SEPTEMBER 2022 - REV.A 
GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM72022A is a double-pole/double-throw (DPDT) 
transfer switch, which supports from 0.4GHz to 5.8GHz. 
The device features low insertion loss and high 
isolation, which make it suitable for high linearity and 
2G/3G/4G/5G applications. 
The SGM72022A has the ability to integrate DPDT 
transfer switch and GPIO controller on an SOI chip. 
Internal driver and decoder for switch control signals 
are offered by the GPIO controller, which makes it 
flexible in RF path routing and band selection. 
No external DC blocking capacitors are required on the 
RF paths as long as no external DC voltage is applied, 
which can save PCB area and cost. 
The SGM72022A is available in a Green ULGA-1.1×
1.5-10L package.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.
