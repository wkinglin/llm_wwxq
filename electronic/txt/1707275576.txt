JANUARY 2024 – REV. A 
GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM48755X is a 4:1 CMOS analog signal 
multiplexer. It operates from 2.5V to 5.5V single power 
supply and all digital inputs support 1.8V logic control. 
Other features include low voltage, high off-isolation and 
low off-leakage current. The high performances make it 
very suitable for multiple applications,  
such as cellular phones, audio and video signal routing, 
etc. 
The SGM48755X is available in a Green MSOP-10 
package. It operates over an ambient temperature 
range of -40℃ to +125℃. 
FEATURES 
● Single Supply Voltage Range: 2.5V to 5.5V 
● On-Resistance: 27Ω (TYP) with 5V Supply 
●  “T” Type Switch 
● 1.8V Logic Compatible 
● Low On-Resistance Flatness 
● High Off-Isolation: -85dB (RL = 50Ω, f = 1MHz) 
● Low Off-Leakage Current: ±1μA (MAX) 
● Low On-Leakage Current: ±1μA (MAX) 
● Low Distortion: 0.33% (RL = 600Ω, f = 20Hz to 20kHz) 
● -40℃ to +125℃ Operating Temperature Range 
● Available in a Green MSOP-10 Package

NOTE: 
1. Internal diodes will clamp the voltage on any signal that is 
lower than GND. Limit the current through the forward diode 
to the maximum ratings. 
 
RECOMMENDED OPERATING CONDITIONS

2.5V to 5.5V 
Operating Temperature Range .................... -40℃ to +125℃ 
 
OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.
