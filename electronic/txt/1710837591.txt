NOTE: 1. VUVLO_RISING is 4.6V but VUVLO_FALLING is lower than 
4.5V, so input must be > 4.6V for startup, and after startup 
SGM61280-3.3V can work down to 4.5V input voltage. 
OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may 
affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

PIN DESCRIPTION 
PIN 
NAME 
TYPE 
FUNCTION 
1 
BST 
I 
Upper Gate Driver Supply Bootstrap Input. Place a 0.1µF/10V ceramic capacitor CBST in series 
with a 10Ω RBST resistor between BST and SW pins as close as possible to the IC. 
2, 3 
SW 
O 
Switching Node Output of the Internal Switches. These pins connect to one terminal of the output 
inductor and the bootstrap circuit. Keep this trace short with minimal copper area to minimize noise 
coupling, but it should be enough to carry inductor current.  
4 
PGND 
G 
Power Ground. 
5 
VIN 
I 
Input Supply Pin. Decouple this pin to PGND with at least 10µF ceramic capacitor as close as 
possible to these two pins. 
6 
EN 
I 
Enable Input. Applying a logic high voltage (above 0.8V and below VIN) to EN pin enables the 
device and a logic low (below 0.4V) will shut it down. EN pin should not be left open.  
This pin is also used to activate the audio avoid mode (AAM) to prevent audio noise at light loads. 
The AAM is allowed if the VEN voltage is in the 0.8V to 1.6V range. The device is enabled without 
AAM if VEN is between 2.3V and VIN. 
7 
PG 
O 
Open-Drain Power Good Indicator. With a pull-up resistor, this output will go high when the VOUT 
is above 91% of is nominal value. Pull it up to VCC or a 5.6V or less voltage rail with a resistor (like 
100kΩ). 
8 
AGND 
G 
Analog Ground. Decouple VCC to AGND with a 1µF ceramic capacitor. 
9 
VCC 
O 
5.6V Internal Supply Linear Regulator Output. Connect a 1μF ceramic capacitor between VCC and 
AGND pins as close to the device as possible. 
10 
OUT 
O 
Output Feedback Pin. OUT is an input pin into the IC and must be connected to the output capacitor 
(regulation point). Output discharge (55Ω) is also through this pin when the device is disabled. It 
also replaces VIN as input source of the LDO regulator when the VOUT is high enough (> 3.1V for 
SGM61280-3.3). 
11 
LDO3 
O 
3.3V LDO Output. It is the power supply source for the internal analog and gate driving circuits, 
and it supplies up to 100mA to external loads. It must be decoupled to PGND with at least a 4.7µF 
ceramic capacitor. 
12 
FB 
I 
Feedback Input Pin. Connect the output voltage with an RC network for closed loop control. Keep 
this line away from noise sources such as SW node. 
 
NOTE: I = input, O = output, G = ground.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
Overview 
The SGM61280 is a wide input voltage synchronous 
Buck converter with constant on-time (COT) control and 
integrated low RDSON power MOSFETs. The COT control 
loop allows stable operation and fast transient response 
even with low ESR output ceramic capacitors and no 
complicated external compensation. It can deliver 8A 
output current due to its integrated synchronous Buck 
converter with low RDSON switches. The VIN input range for 
SGM61280-3.3 is from 4.5V to 23V. 
The proprietary technology used in the COT control for 
this device, provides excellent load and line regulation 
and very fast transient response along with high flexibility. 
Transient response is almost instantaneous because the 
COT is not clock-based unlike other methods using 
clocked PWM where the loop reacts to the events in the 
next clock cycles. Therefore, the inductor current reacts 
to deviations immediately to keep the output in regulation. 
This device can employ both low ESR (like POSCAP or 
SP-CAP) and ultra-low ESR ceramic capacitors for 
output capacitance. 
A linear regulator with 100mA output capacity is provided 
in the device. If VOUT exceeds 3.1V, the regulator source 
will automatically switch from the input (VIN) to the output 
(VOUT) through OUT pin to minimize the losses. 
 
Under-Voltage Lockout (UVLO) 
The input voltage (VIN) is continuously monitored and if 
it falls below the under-voltage lockout falling threshold, 
the device shuts down. The UVLO is necessary to avoid 
device malfunction due to low supply voltage such as 
insufficient gate voltage for turning the power switches 
to fully on-state. 
The UVLO is non-latching and if VIN exceeds the under-
voltage lockout rising threshold (if EN is logic high), 
device will exit shutdown and resume switching. 
 
Enable Input (EN) 
The active-high EN input pin can be used to enable or 
shutdown the device and to allow the audio avoid 
mode (AAM). If EN is a logic low voltage (below 0.4V), 
device will shut down. If EN is a logic high (above 0.8V) 
and VIN > VUVLO, the device will be enabled. 
This pin is also used to activate the audio avoid mode 
(AAM) to prevent audio noise at light loads. If the EN 
voltage is in the 0.8V to 1.6V range, the device is 
allowed to enter AAM during light load PFM to prevent 
acoustic noise. 
The LDO3 output and VCC are in on-state as long as VIN > 
VUVLO. See Table 1 for the SGM61280 power logic.

Bootstrap Circuit (CBST and RBST) 
The high-side (HS) switch gate driver needs a voltage 
higher than VIN to turn on the gate of the high-side N-
MOSFET switch (for example, 5V + VIN or higher). The 
external bootstrap capacitor (CBST) is used to provide 
this higher voltage for supplying the HS gate driver. CBST 
is charged through the internal bootstrap diode from 
VCC when the low-side (LS) switch turns on and SW 
node is at around 0V. When the LS switch turns off and 
HS switch turns on, the SW voltage will rise to the VIN 
rail voltage and the CBST voltage will supply the HS 
driver.  
Refer to Figure 1 for CBST and RBST combinations. Use 
a 0.1μF ceramic capacitor (CBST) with lower ESR and a 
series 10Ω resistor (RBST) between the BST and the SW 
pins for bootstrapping.  
The RBST helps to control the turn-on time of the HS 
switch and is good to compromise the switching loss 
and the EMI radiation. The gate driver is designed for 
fast turn-on and minimal switching loss (that is, for good 
efficiency). But the additional resistance of the RBST can 
slow down the turn-on (VSW rising) to reduce the EMI at 
the expense of small increase in the switching loss due 
to the longer turn-on time of the HS switch. 
 
Soft-Start 
An internal 0.6ms (TYP) soft-start ramp circuit is 
implemented to gradually increase the PWM reference 
voltage for output regulation, in order to limit the startup 
inrush current from the source and to prevent unwanted 
over-current protection trips during power-up. This timer 
starts when EN goes high (if VIN > VUVLO) or when VIN 
exceeds the under-voltage lockout rising threshold if EN 
is already high.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
VCC and LDO3 (Linear Regulators) 
VCC regulator is powered from VIN to power the internal 
circuitry and the gate drivers. It should be decoupled 
with a 1μF ceramic capacitor close to the device.  
The LDO3 (3.3V) can deliver 100mA to external loads. 
The LDO should be decoupled with at least 4.7μF 
ceramic capacitor. When VOUT exceeds above 3.1V, the 
source of the LDO will automatically switch from VIN to 
OUT by an internal MOSFET to minimize LDO losses. 
 
Power Good Indicator Output (PG) 
The PG pin is an open-drain output with a pull-up 
resistor which will go to logic high if the output voltage is 
near its expected value. It is recommended to connect 
a 100kΩ pull-up resistor to a high rail which is not larger 
than 5V. VPG will be pulled low, if VOUT drops below 85% 
(TYP) of its nominal value and will go high if it exceeds 
91% of the nominal regulation value. 
PG is held low during soft-start state. To avoid false 
signaling, PG responds with a 10μs delay and changes 
state if at the end of this delay, the new state is still valid. 
 
Output Over/Under-Voltage Protection 
An over-voltage protection (OVP) is triggered if the VOUT 
exceeds the over-voltage threshold (above regulation) 
for about 20μs or longer. Upon OVP trip, the HS switch 
remains off and the LS switch remains on until the 
inductor current drops to zero and then the device will 
shut down. 
Output voltage is also protected against under-voltage 
protection (UVP). If the output voltage falls and remains 
below the under-voltage threshold for about 20μs, the 
device shuts down.  
After OVP or UVP, the device will shut down in latch-off 
mode and will not restart automatically. An EN toggle or 
VIN power cycling is needed to restart the device. 
 
Pulse Frequency Modulation Mode (PFM) 
In light loads, the SGM61280 can enter the PFM mode 
to keep the efficiency high. Light load condition is 
detected at the CCM and DCM boundary condition in 
which inductor valley current reaches to zero due to the 
output current drop. 
In PFM, upon detection of zero inductor current, the LS 
switch turns off and the output capacitor will take longer 
time to discharge (tOFF extends) until the VOUT (or VFB) 
drops to the level needed to begin a new cycle (HS turn 
on or tON pulse). 
 
Audio Avoid Mode (AAM) 
To avoid acoustic noise when the PFM frequency drops 
below audible range (20kHz), the AAM can be activated 
by bringing the EN voltage between 0.8V and 1.6V. In 
this mode, a special diode emulation mode will be 
activated to keep the minimum switching period to about 
30μs (about 33.3kHz), which is called audio avoid mode. 
This mode can keep the switching frequency above the 
hearing range even in no load condition. 
 
Output Current Limit (OCP) 
A cycle-by-cycle valley current detection is implemented 
to limit the output current. During tOFF portion of each 
cycle (in which LS is conducting), the current of the 
synchronous rectifier (LS switch) is monitored by 
measuring 
its 
drain-to-source 
voltage 
that 
is 
proportional to its current. This measurement is 
temperature compensated for better accuracy. If the 
valley current exceeds the threshold, the one-shot timer 
that produces the constant on-time (for the tON period) 
will be disabled and not allowed until the inductor 
current, which is going through LS during tOFF, drops 
below the valley current limit. During current limiting, the 
output voltage will drop because the required load 
current is not supplied by the inductor. If the output 
voltage drops below the output UVP level (see Output 
Over/Under-Voltage Protection section), the device will 
shut down and stop switching to avoid over-temperature. 
 
Thermal Shutdown 
The die temperature (TJ) is constantly monitored for 
over-temperature protection (OTP). If TJ exceeds the 
TSD threshold (+154°C, TYP), the device shuts down to 
avoid damage. OTP is a latch-off mode protection and 
an EN toggle or VIN power cycling is needed to restart 
the device.

Input Capacitor Selection 
For the input capacitor selection, SGM61280 requires 
high-quality ceramic decoupling capacitors, such as 
X5R or X7R or similar. These types of capacitors are 
commonly used for power regulator capacitors due to 
their stable dielectric material, which results in less 
capacitance variation and greater temperature stability. 
When choosing the input capacitors, the voltage rating 
of capacitor should have a safe margin from maximum 
input voltage. Choosing an input capacitor with a 
voltage rating 1.5 times higher than the maximum input 
voltage is a safe design practice. The input RMS current 
can be calculated by Equation 1:

To select a suitable capacitor for the RMS current rating, 
it is recommended to use multiple capacitors with low 
Equivalent Series Resistance (ESR) in parallel to form 
a capacitor bank. Therefore, two 10μF low ESR 
capacitors are placed at the input. The input ripple

Inductor  
When selecting an inductor, it is important to specify 
both the inductance and the peak current required. 
Inductor selection is usually flexible, and depending on 
the tradeoff between size, cost, and circuit efficiency. 
Lower inductor values can reduce size and cost, and 
improve transient response. However, the inductor 
ripple current and output voltage ripple are increased, 
and the efficiency is also reduced due to the higher peak 
current. In contrast, higher inductance values result in 
higher efficiency, but at the cost of increased physical 
size or increased resistance due to the need for more 
turns of wire. In addition, the transient response will be 
slower due to the additional time it takes to change the 
current in the inductor. The approximate inductor value 
can be calculated by using Equation 3:

where, 
IOUT_MAX is the maximum load current. To ensure the full-
load range requirement, the saturation current rating 
(ISAT) must be larger than the IL_PEAK. To achieve optimal 
efficiency, select an inductor with low DC resistance that 
meets size and cost requirements. An inductor with a 
shielded ferrite core is the best choice for the application, 
which minimizes the core losses and causes fewer EMI 
and noise issues.

Output Capacitor Selection 
To achieve the best performance, ceramic capacitors 
are recommended to be used at the output. The 
capacitance should be chosen based on the desired 
output ripple level and the transient response, including 
over-shoot and undershoot during the load transient.  
In a Buck converter, the output ripple is mainly caused 
by the inductor current ripple and its effect on the output 
capacitor ESR and storage charge, which are called 
ESR ripple and capacitance ripple, respectively. Due to 
the extremely low ESR and relatively small capacitance 
of ceramic capacitors, the amplitudes of the two types 
of ripple are similar. In applications where ripple 
performance is important, both ESR ripple and 
capacitive ripple should be considered.

In most applications, transient response is usually the 
more stringent criterion. The output capacitor must 
either supply the increased load current or absorb the 
excess inductor current (as the load current decreases) 
until the control loop can readjust the inductor current to 
the new load level. Typically, COT structure has a very 
fast transient response and small output transients. 
However, under some application conditions, such as at 
low output voltages and low duty cycles, the use of small 
ceramic capacitors increases the magnitude of output 
voltage variation when the load changes fast. The 
following section describes the calculation of worst-case 
voltage variations in response to very fast load steps. 
The following function is to calculate the ESR step:

The magnitude of the capacitive sag is determined by 
various factors, including the load step, the capacitance 
of the output capacitor, the inductance value, the 
voltage difference between the input and output, and the 
maximum duty cycle. The maximum duty cycle in a 
quick transition is influenced by the on-time and 
minimum off-time because the COT control method 
increases current by spacing out on-times with minimal 
off-times as fast as possible. To find the estimated on-
time (ignoring parasitic effects) and maximum duty cycle 
for a specific input and output voltage, following 
Equations can be used:

The effective on-time duration may be slightly extended 
as the integrated circuit adjusts for voltage reductions 
within the circuit. However, these adjustments can be 
disregarded as the on-time duration is increased to 
account for the voltage losses. The output voltage SAG 
can be determined by calculating it as Equation 12:

Many applications typically do not encounter immediate 
full-load changes, and the integrated circuit's high 
switching frequency and rapid transient response can 
effectively manage voltage regulation under all 
circumstances. However, in scenarios involving low-
voltage CPU cores or DDR memory supply applications, 
especially devices operating at high clock frequencies 
and rapidly switching between sleep modes, voltage 
sag or soar can cause problems. In such cases, 
mitigating excessive voltage transients can be achieved 
by either increasing the quantity of ceramic output 
capacitors or incorporating additional bulk capacitance. 
For applications characterized by significant rapid 
transients, it is advisable to calculate over-shoot and 
undershoot to ensure that over-voltage protection and 
under-voltage protection mechanisms are not triggered.

Feed-Forward Capacitor CFF Design  
To enhance adaptability and performance of the 
SGM61280, 
a 
feed-forward 
capacitor 
CFF 
is 
incorporated into the feedback loop of the integrated 
compensator within the IC. The purpose of adding a 
feed-forward loop is to improve the transient response 
by modifying the gain and phase characteristics. Adding 
CFF in the feedback network forms a new zero and a 
high-frequency pole in the loop, which results in 
increased gain and phase at mid-frequencies, thereby 
extending the bandwidth and enhancing phase margin. 
In addition, the pole reduces high-frequency noise. 
These properties enable SGM61280 to obtain faster 
response during load transients.

In order to achieve the maximum phase boost, the 
original bandwidth of the system must be at the 
maximum phase boost frequency. Therefore, to choose 
the 
appropriate 
feed-forward 
capacitance, 
it 
is 
necessary to determine the original bandwidth position 
of the system. The bandwidth of the converter is 
approximated by observing the voltage deviation 
frequency during the load step of the converter, as 
shown in Figure 5.

It is important to note that the introduction of feed-

which could lead to the deviation of VOUT. If the output 
value exceeds the specification value, the CFF value 
needs to be decreased. The internal dividing resistors of 
the SGM61280 are shown in Table 2.

LAYOUT INFORMATION
Designing a good PCB layout has a significant impact 
on the performance of a switching power supply. For the 
SGM61280, the layout design can be more critical due 
to the high switching frequency, high output current and 
more sensitivity of the COT controllers to the noise. One 
of the goals of a good layout is to minimize the EMI 
radiations and the influence (coupling) of the switching 
noise on the sensitive feedback routes. The voltage 
gradients induced on the ground planes or other 
sensitive routes should be minimized to avoid switching 
instability and deviation from regulation point.  
The following layout guidelines are recommended to get 
the best performance from the SGM61280. 
• Consider short, straight, and wide copper traces for 
the main current paths. 
• Place the input capacitor and the output capacitor 
close to the device with the shortest possible 
connection traces. 
• Keep the SW node area minimal. Also keep this node 
and the components directly connected to it away 
from sensitive copper traces and feedback elements 
(such as FB and OUT pins). Avoid using vias for SW 
node and make it thick and short for high current.  
• Along with the SW, the PGND pin serves as a main 
heatsinking path. Connect PGND to a large ground 
plane and stitch it with thermal vias to ground planes 
on the other layers and specifically to the back side of 
the PCB for heat sinking and noise reduction. 
• Feedback route must be wide and away from the SW 
node. The input of the 100mA LDO is supplied directly 
from the OUT feedback line. 
• For less parasitic inductance, use multiple vias under 
the device close to VIN, PGND and the decoupling 
capacitors pads.
