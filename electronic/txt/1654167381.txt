JANUARY2022–REV.A 
GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM48523/4A/5/6 are dual high-speed low-side 
gate drivers for MOSFET and IGBT power switches. 
They have rail-to-rail driving capability and can sink and 
source up to 5A peak current with capacitive loads. The 
propagation delays are very short and well matched 
between the two channels that make the device very fit 
for applications that need accurate dual gate driving 
such 
as 
synchronous 
rectifiers. 
The 
matched 
propagation delays also allow for paralleling the two 
channels when higher driving current is required for 
example for paralleled switches. The input voltage 
thresholds are fixed, independent of supply voltage 
(VDD) and are compatible with low voltage TTL and 
CMOS logic. Noise immunity is excellent due to the 
wide hysteresis window between the input low and high 
thresholds. The devices have internal pull-up/pull-down 
resistors on the input pins to ensure low state on the 
driver outputs when the inputs are floating. 
The SGM48523/4A/5 offer 3 logic options: dual inverting 
(SGM48523), dual non-inverting (SGM48524A), and 
one inverting and one non-inverting (SGM48525). They 
have independent enable pins (ENA and ENB) for each 
channel with active-high logic that can be left open for 
normal operation because of internal pull-up to VDD. 
The SGM48526 offers a flexible dual input design 
which can be configured as inverting (-INx) or 
non-inverting (+INx) for each channel. Both inputs 
(+INx or -INx) can control the output state. Typically, 
one input is used for gate pulse and the other one is 
used for enable/disable function. 
The SGM48523/4A/5 are available in SOIC-8, MSOP-8 
(Exposed Pad) and TDFN-3×3-8L packages. The 
SGM48526 is available in a Green TDFN-3×3-8L 
package. They operate over a temperature range of 
-40℃ to +140℃.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
The SGM48523/4A/5/6 dual-channel, low-side, high- 
speed gate drivers are among the top level devices in 
the market featuring a 5A source/sink current capability 
and industry best-in-class switching characteristics. 
They have several other prominent features as listed in 
Table 5 assuring that they are reliable and efficient gate 
driving solutions for power switches in high frequency 
applications. 
 
Table 5. Prominent Features and Benefits 
Feature 
Benefit 
Best-in-class propagation delays (18ns, TYP). 
Very low delay and distortion in pulse transmission. 
Excellent delay matching between channels (1ns, TYP). 
Allows paralleling of the channel outputs for double current driving 
capability. It is especially useful for driving paralleled power switches. 
Wide supply voltage range (VDD from 4.5V to 18V). 
Design Flexibility. 
Wide operating temperature range (-40℃ to +140℃). 
Wider system operating temperature range and smaller cooling system. 
UVLO protection on VDD. 
Driver outputs are logic low in UVLO condition to ensure controlled and 
glitch-free driving during power-up and power-down. 
Outputs are logic low when inputs (INx) are floating. 
This safety feature prevents unexpected gate pulses during abnormal 
situations such as the conditions tested in the safety certification. 
Outputs are enabled when enable inputs (ENx) are floating. 
This feature provides pin-to-pin compatibility with other similar products 
in those designs where pin 1 and 8 are floating. 
Wide hysteresis CMOS/TTL compatible input and enable thresholds. 
Improved noise immunity while compatible with digital logic (3.3V, 5V). 
Input/enable pins voltage levels are not restricted by VDD. 
Simplified system especially in the auxiliary bias supply architecture. 
Ability to handle -8V VDC (MAX) at input pins. 
Increased robustness in noisy environments. 
 
Under-Voltage Lockout for VDD 
The internal under-voltage lockout (UVLO) protection 
keeps the outputs in low state when the VDD supply 
voltage is insufficient for proper operation of the chip. If 
VDD rises but its voltage does not reach UVLO 
threshold, the outputs are logic low, ignoring the state 
of the inputs. The UVLO rising threshold voltage is 4.2V 
(TYP) and has a 350mV (TYP) hysteresis band to 
prevent output from chattering when VDD has large 
superimposed noise or other fluctuations. The safe low 
voltage (less than 5V) operating capability along with 
the excellent switching characteristics makes the 
device well suited for driving GaN power switches. 
If the enable pin is active or floating during power-up, 
the output remains low until VDD exceeds the UVLO 
threshold. Then the output is controlled by the input 
signal with a magnitude that follows VDD (see Figure 12 
for non-inverting and Figure 13 for inverting channels).

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Because VDD pin is the supply source for the device 
internal circuits, it is recommended to use two VDD 
surface mount bypass capacitors to prevent noise 
problems caused by high speed switching. A small 
100nF ceramic capacitor must be soldered as close 
between the VDD and GND pins as possible. In 
addition, a larger low ESR capacitor (a few μF) must be 
placed in parallel and close to the same pins for 
delivery of the high peak driving currents with sharp rise 
time. The low impedance characteristic provided by 
these capacitors allows high frequency and high 
current driving of the outputs. Avoid using vias for 
connecting bypass capacitors to the device pins. 
 
Operating Supply Current 
The SGM48523/4A/5/6 consume a very low quiescent 
current. The lowest quiescent IDD value is reached 
when the device is fully powered (not in UVLO), and the 
outputs are in a low or high DC static state and the 
internal pull-up inputs (enable inputs) are in high or float 
state. During normal operation, the total IDD current is 
the sum of three components: the quiescent current, 
the average IOUT current due to switching and the 
internal pull-up resistor currents (on enable inputs and 
inverting inputs). Clearly if an inverting input pin that 
has an internal pull-up resistor is externally pulled low, 
a small additional current is drawn from VDD through the 
internal pull-up resistor (see Figure 8 through Figure 11). 
Usually the main portion of the supply current is for 
driving the outputs and the other two can be ignored. 
For driving MOSFETs with a frequency of fSW and gate 
charge of Qg, the average driver output current is IOUT = 
Qg ⨯ fSW. 
 
Input Stage 
The SGM48523/4A/5/6 input pins are compatible with 
TTL and CMOS logic thresholds and are independent 
of the supply voltage (VDD). The logic high threshold is 
typically around 2V and the low threshold is around 1.2V. 
Therefore the inputs can be easily driven by a 3.3V or 5V 
digital controller. The noise immunity is enhanced due 
to the relatively wide hysteresis band (2V - 1.2V = 0.8V, 
TYP) compared to the traditional TTL logic in which the 
hysteresis is typically less than 0.5V. The input voltage 
thresholds of the SGM48523/4A/5/6 are tightly 
controlled to simplify the system design and assure 
stable operation against wide temperature variations. 
Also the devices are designed with very low parasitic 
input pin capacitances to allow high speed switching. 
An important safety feature of the drivers is that if any 
of the input pins floats, the corresponding channel 
output will be held in the low state. This feature is 
implemented by the GND pull-down resistors on the 
non-inverting inputs and VDD pull-up resistors on the 
inverting inputs as shown in Figure 8 through Figure 11. 
The SGM48526 has two input pins in each channel to 
control the output. The SGM48526 offers the flexibility 
to use either a non-inverting input (+INx) or an inverting 
input (-INx) to drive the output on each channel. The 
output state depends on both +INx and -INx pins (x = A 
or B). When one input pin is chosen to drive the output, 
the other unused input cannot be left floating and must 
be biased to allow output control by the other pin. As 
explained before if an input is floating, the channel 
output is disabled by the internal pull-up or pull-down 
resistors for safety. The unused input pin can function 
as enable/disable input. In summary, the SGM48526 
output is only driven high when +INx pin is high and 
-INx is low. The details are provided in the function 
table and the application diagrams given in Figure 2 
and Figure 3. 
The input driving signal must have short rise or fall time. 
This condition is normally satisfied when the input 
signals are generated by a PWM controller or logic gate 
(with transition times < 200ns). If the input transition is 
too slow, the output may chatter several times (at high 
frequency) before going to its new stable state. The 
wide input hysteresis of these devices minimizes the 
concern for such problem even for other logic 
thresholds. However, the designer should make sure 
the 
implementation 
satisfies 
the 
driver 
input 
requirements. To limit the rise or fall time of the gate 
pulse on the output, it is recommended to use an 
external series resistance between the driver output 
and the gate of the power device. This resistor reduces 
the switching gate charge losses in the driver output 
stage because a portion of the loss will dissipate in the 
resistor. 
 
Enable 
The enable function is very useful in some applications 
that need to block gate pulses depending on the 
system operating conditions. For example, in a 
synchronous rectifier and in light load conditions, it may 
be necessary to disable gate signal to avoid negative 
current in the device for improving efficiency or to 
prevent boosting in a buck converter.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
The SGM48523/4A/5 devices have an independent 
active-high enable pin (ENx). Similar to the driver 
inputs, the enable pins are independent of the supply 
voltage with tightly controlled thresholds and are 
compatible with TTL or CMOS logic. They can be 
directly controlled by the popular 3.3V and 5V 
microcontrollers. The ENx pins (x = A or B) are internally 
pulled up to VDD by pull-up resistors and the output 
channel x is enabled if ENx input is floating. Therefore 
the SGM48523/4A/5 are pin-to-pin compatible with 
SGMICRO’s previous gate driver. Note that if two 
channels in a device are paralleled, the enable signals 
should also be tied together. 
The SGM48526 device does not have specified enable 
pins. However, the unused input pin can be used to 
enable or disable the device. Either pulling +INx down 
to GND or pulling -INx up to VDD disables the output. 
Therefore, +INx pin is used as an active high enable pin, 
while -INx is used as an active low enable pin. Note that 
while the ENA and ENB pins in SGM48523/4A/5 are 
allowed to be floating during normal operation and the 
outputs will be enabled. The unused input pins in 
SGM48526 are not allowed to be floating. 
 
Tightly Matched and Low Propagation 
Delays 
The 
SGM48523/4A/5/6 
drivers 
offer 
very 
low 
propagation delays (18ns, TYP), and pulse transmission 
distortion between input and output. Such low distortion 
is important in the industry for high frequency switching 
applications, for example, in the synchronous rectifier 
applications where both SR MOSFETs are driven with 
one driver. Moreover, the delays between the two 
channels are extremely well matched with 1ns (TYP) 
difference. This feature is critically important when 
accurate timing between dual gate drives is required. 
For example, in some PFC applications, two paralleled 
MOSFETs may be needed to be driven independently 
using each output channel and with the same input 
pulses. The matching gate drivers ensure that they are 
driven simultaneously with the minimum turn-on or 
turn-off delay differences. The tight matching also 
allows for paralleling the two channels to increase 
current driving capability. The INA and INB pins are tied 
together as input and OUTA and OUTB pins are tied 
together as output. Caution must be exercised that any 
delay between triggering of the two channels can lead 
to a shoot-through between outputs. Note that as 
described in Figure 14, the input signals must also be 
well matched and with fast rise or fall time. Due to the 
small differences between the input thresholds, a pulse 
with slow rise or fall time may add extra delay between 
signals. Therefore, it is recommended to use very fast 
input pulses (20V/µs or greater) when inputs are 
paralleled. Also, the tie point for inputs must be as close 
as possible to the chip. If possible, adding external 
series gate resistors between the outputs will also help. 
Considering small 0Ω series output resistors in the 
layout is recommended to allow future adjustment in 
the design if needed.

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
In order to achieve fast switching and to reduce losses 
in the power switches, high current gate drivers with 
sufficient drive voltage are required. Such function 
cannot be directly provided by logic controllers usually 
operating at low power and low voltages such as 3.3V. 
Even traditional buffer drivers like totem-pole NPN/PNP 
configurations, are not useful as they are not capable 
for voltage level shifting. A gate driver device provides 
other advantages in the system such as reduction of 
the high frequency noise by placing the high current 
driver close to the power switch, and reduction of power 
dissipation and thermal stress in controllers because 
gate-charge power losses are handled by the driver. 
Moreover, with the emerging of wide band-gap power 
devices such as GaN based switches that are capable 
for operating at very high frequency, new gate driving 
requirements are imposed on the driver devices. Such 
requirements include operating at low supply voltages 
(5V or less), low propagation delays and excellent 
delay matching, and compact layout with low 
inductance and enhanced thermal capability. 
In summary, gate driver devices simplify the system 
design and provide better performance, lower cost, 
lower component count and require less space on the 
board. 
Supply Voltage VDD 
The supply voltage is selected based on the power 
switch and driving requirements. Some power switches, 
need positive gate voltage for turn-on and negative for 
turn-off and for some other types, it is reversed. In both 
cases the differential drive voltage is equal to VDD that 
can be selected in a wide range from 4.5V to 18V. This 
gate driver can be used for driving of a variety of power 
switches. Typically for Si MOSFETs, the driving VGS is 
chosen to be 4.5V, 10V or 12V depending on the 
application and switch class. For IGBTs, a VGE of 15V 
or 18V is commonly used. 
 
Propagation Delay 
The propagation delays depend on the operating 
switching 
frequency 
and 
the 
permissible 
pulse 
distortion. All devices present very short 18ns (TYP) 
propagation delays. Switching characteristics with more 
details are provided to illustrate the propagation and 
switching performance. 
Drive Current and Power Dissipation 
MOSFETs are widely used as power switches in many 
high frequency applications. The SGM48523/4A/5/6 
can source and sink 5A at 12V for a pulse width of 
several hundred nanoseconds for driving MOSFETs. 
High peak driving current is usually needed for a quick 
turn on and usually the same amount of current in 
opposite direction is also needed for switch turn off. 
The sourcing and sinking actions repeat at the 
switching frequency and for each transition some 
energy is dissipated in the driver device. 
The amount of power dissipation in the device depends 
on the following: 
• Switching frequency. 
• Gate charge required to turn the MOSFET on or off.  
• Size of the external gate resistors used (if any). 
Gate charge is usually a function of the VGS drive 
voltage. The drive voltage is VGS ≈ VDD (the dropout of 
the driver, VOH, is normally very low). Note that due to 
the low quiescent current and the internal bias power, 
the loss in the driver is effectively equal to the output 
driving losses caused by drive currents. 
Using a discrete capacitor (Cg) as a similar switch gate 
load for testing, the loss in the driver can be easily 
estimated. The energy that is needed to charge the 
capacitor to the supply voltage VDD is given by (1):

It can be proved that the same amount of energy is 
dissipated in the driver output stage resistances. Also, 
the same amount of energy is dissipated if the 
capacitor is discharged by the driver. Therefore, with a 
switching frequency of fSW, the total power loss (in one 
channel) is:

APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued) 
The test is implemented on MOSFETs to find the 
equivalent gate capacitance to determine the gate 
charge required for switching the device. The gate 
charge includes the impact of the input gate-source and 
drain-gate capacitances. The drain-gate capacitance 
also needs current for charge and discharge due to the 
voltage swing of the drain voltage when the power 
device is turning on and off. Usually the typical and 
maximum 
gate 
charges 
(Qg) 
are 
provided 
by 
manufacturers for switching the device under specified 
conditions. Because Qg = CgVDD, the power loss in the 
driver can be calculated from (4) too:

For example, for driving a power MOSFET with 50nC of 
gate charge (Qg = 50nC) at 500kHz with VDD = 12V, the 
driver loss due to gate charge will be 0.3W. For this 
driver that includes two channels, the total loss related 
to gate charge is doubled when driving similar 
MOSFETs:

When an external series gate resistor, Rg, is used for 
MOSFET or IGBT, a portion the PG loss will dissipate on 
Rg and not inside the driver. With a simplified analysis, 
the gate driving loss inside each channel can be 
calculated by (6):

Where ROFF = ROL is the effective pull-down resistance 
from the channel output to the ground and RON is the 
effective resistance of the internal pull-up structure to 
VDD (in the SGM48523/4A/5/6). 
To find the total loss in the device, the quiescent current 
losses (PQ = IDD,Q × VDD) should be added. Due to small 
quiescent current (IDD,Q ≤ 0.6mA) of the device, this loss 
is small and can be ignored. With VDD = 12V the 
quiescent loss is PQ = 0.6mA ×12V = 7.2mW. 
The actual driver supply current can be calculated as:

With PG = 0.6W and VDD = 12V the device supply 
current will be IDD = 50mA. 
 
Power Supply Recommendation 
The supply voltage ranges (VDD) for SGM48523/4A/5/6 
are between 4.5V and 18V. The absolute maximum 
stress that the device tolerates is 20V. Considering a 
2V margin for transient spikes, the maximum range is 
set to 18V. The minimum limit is dictated by the UVLO 
protection. In UVLO condition, the outputs are logic low, 
ignoring the input states. UVLO has an almost 0.35V 
hysteresis and an operating driver will not shut down 
unless VDD falls below VOFF = 3.85V (TYP). Therefore, it 
is important to make sure that for the designed system, 
the supply ripple or voltage drops do not fall below 
UVLO lower threshold that triggers device shutdown. A 
100nF low ESR ceramic capacitor with another 
surface-mount capacitor of few microfarads between 
VDD and GND are necessary to prevent VDD transient 
drops. Similarly, at start-up, the device starts operation 
when the VDD pin voltage exceeds the VON threshold 
(4.2V, TYP).
