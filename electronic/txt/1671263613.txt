DECEMBER 2021 – REV. B 
GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM7229 is a DPDT (double-pole/double-throw) 
analog switch. It operates from a 1.8V to 5.5V single 
power supply. Each switch of the SGM7229 is 
bidirectional, which can ensure that the high speed 
signals have little or no attenuation at the outputs. 
The SGM7229 features high speed, low bit-to-bit skew 
and wide bandwidth. These high performances make it 
very suitable for multiple applications, such as cellular 
phones and computer peripherals, etc. 
The SGM7229 has power-off and power-on protections. 
Because of the special circuitry on the D+/D- pins, the 
device will not be damaged even if VBUS short-circuit 
occurs during data transmission. In addition, it can 
prevent accidental from leaking and ensure system 
reliability under power-down and over-voltage conditions. 
The SGM7229 is available in Green MSOP-10 and 
UTQFN-1.8×1.4-10L packages. It operates over an 
ambient temperature range of -40℃ to +85℃. 
FEATURES 
● Single Supply Voltage Range: 1.8V to 5.5V 
● On-Resistance: 6Ω (TYP) at 3V 
● High Off-Isolation: -26dB (RL = 50Ω, f = 250MHz) 
● Low Crosstalk: -20dB (RL = 50Ω, f = 250MHz) 
● -3dB Bandwidth: 850MHz 
● Fast Switching Times at VCC = 3.3V: 
tON = 30ns 
tOFF = 18ns 
● Break-Before-Make Switching 
● Rail-to-Rail Input and Output Operation 
● Power-Off and Power-On Protections 
● -40℃ to +85℃ Operating Temperature Range 
● Available in Green UTQFN-1.8×1.4-10L and 
MSOP-10 Packages

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.
