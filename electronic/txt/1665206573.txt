Dual Adjustable Voltage Detector 
with Reset and Gate Driver Outputs

SEPTEMBER2022–REV.A 
 
GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM852 is a dual adjustable voltage detector with 
reset and gate driver outputs. Two adjustable sense 
inputs can monitor a wide voltage range through external 
resistor dividers. The device has internal sequence timing. 
The delay time of two outputs can be programmed by 
their respective external capacitors. The gate driver 
output is implemented for external N-MOSFET by a 
charge pump circuit. 
Two options are available. When both VSEN1 and 
VSEN2 voltages exceed the internal fixed rising threshold 
voltage in SGM852A, or VSEN1 voltage exceeds the 
internal fixed rising threshold and VSEN2 voltage falls 
below the internal fixed falling threshold in SGM852B, 
both internal comparators output high, the reset output 
(nRESET) asserts high after a propagation delay and a 
capacitor charge set-time delay. And if either of the 
comparators outputs low, nRESET asserts low. 
The SGM852 is available in a Green TDFN-3×3-10L 
package. It operates over a junction temperature range 
of -40℃ to +125℃.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
The SGM852 is used to monitor dual-voltage systems 
and provides sequential control with two outputs. When 
the power input voltage (VCC) exceeds the POR 
threshold voltage, VPOR (2.6V, TYP), dual voltages are 
monitored through the respective external resistor 
dividers into VSEN1 and VSEN2 pin. Once both 
VSENx voltages exceed the internal fixed rising 
threshold, VRTH (0.6V, TYP), in SGM852A or once 
VSEN1 exceeds VRTH and VSEN2 falls below the fixed 
falling threshold VFTH, (0.55V, TYP), in SGM852B, both 
internal comparators output high, the internal 1µA (TYP) 
current source ICD_RST starts charging external capacitor 
at CD_RST pin. Once the voltage at CD_RST pin exceeds 
VRTH_RST (1.234V, TYP), the nRESET outputs high and 
then another 1µA (TYP) current source ICD_GATE starts 
charging external capacitor at CD_GATE pin. Once the 
voltage at CD_GATE pin exceeds VRTH_GATE (1.234V, TYP), 
the GATE pin starts to drive an external N-MOSFET 
with a voltage level of 2 × VDD. Accordingly, the 
corresponding delay time can be programmed by 
choosing the capacitors at CD_RST pin and CD_GATE pin. If 
either of the two comparators outputs low, the nRESET 
outputs low and charge pump is disabled. 
 
Comparators 
The comparators can provide threshold voltage to 
monitor VSEN1 and VSEN2 sensing voltage, VVSEN1 
and VVSEN2. For SGM852A, both VSEN1 and VSEN2 
are connected to the positive input of the corresponding 
comparator, while the internal reference is connected to 
the negative input of the two comparators. So when 
both VSEN1 and VSEN2 exceed VRTH, the nRESET 
outputs high after a CD_RST controlled delay time. For 
SGM852B, VSEN1 is connected to the positive input of 
the comparator with the internal reference connecting 
to the negative input of the comparator, while VSEN2 is 
connected to the negative input of the comparator with 
the internal reference connecting to the positive input of 
the comparator. Therefore, for SGM852B, when 
VSEN1 exceeds VRTH and VSEN2 falls below VFTH, 
both comparators output high, and the nRESET outputs 
high after a CD_RST-controlled delay time. If either of the 
comparators outputs low, the nRESET outputs low. 
 
Power-On Reset (POR) 
The device resets all fault latches and starts to monitor 
VVSEN1 and VVSEN2 once VCC exceeds 2.6V. 
 
Charge Pump 
The charge pump with an internal oscillator is designed 
to drive external N-MOSFET with a voltage level of 2 × 
VDD. 
 
Regulators 
The input voltage of the SGM852 is range from 3V to 
16V. The built-in regulator provides 5V internal VDD if 
VCC is above 5V, and it tracks VCC if VCC is below 5V. 
 
Push-Pull Reset Output 
The nRESET is a push-pull reset output pin. When both 
internal comparators output high, the nRESET asserts 
high after CD_RST-controlled delay time. And if either of 
the comparators outputs low, nRESET asserts low after 
CD_RST is discharged. 
 
GATE Output 
When nRESET asserts high, the charge pump is 
enabled after CD_GATE-controlled delay time. And then, 
GATE provides a voltage of 2 × VDD to drive the 
external N-MOSFET. If nRESET asserts low, the 
charge pump is disabled after CD_GATE discharged, and 
GATE will be discharged to 0V. 
 
Over-Temperature Protection (OTP) 
The SGM852 may heat up due to power dissipation, and 
then enter into the thermal shutdown state. The thermal 
shutdown threshold TSD is +155℃ (TYP). The OTP will 
turn off charge pump and timer function during this state. 
Accordingly, both nRESET and GATE output low. And 
the device will be shut down and remain off until the IC 
temperature drops below +135℃ (TYP).

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
VSENx Transient Immunity 
The VSEN1 and VSEN2 pins of the SGM852 have 
certain anti-interference ability. Once the transient 
duration exceeds the corresponding maximum allowed 
time, the nRESET pin will go low. 
 
Adjustable Input Sensing Threshold 
The dual sense inputs, VSEN1 and VSEN2, can 
monitor system voltage through a resistive divider 
network with VRTH in a wide range. As shown in Figure 
4, VS is the system voltage. The trigger voltage of 
system VS_TH can be calculated by equation (1):

Figure 4. Setting Trigger Voltage of System 
The absolute maximum voltages of VSEN1 and VSEN2 
are not allowed to exceed 3V. Due to the leakage 
currents of them are 100nA, the accuracy of VS_TH 
should be taken into consideration. However, low value 
resistor 
will 
cause 
more 
power 
consumption. 
Appropriate selection of resistance value is also very 
critical. 
The appropriate resistance value can be selected 
through the following equation based on the amount of 
acceptable error.

Adjustable Delay (CD_RST, CD_GATE) 
Users should choose external capacitors to set the 
charge time from internal 1µA (TYP) current source and 
thus set nRESET and GATE pins output delay time. 
When the input voltage exceeds the POR threshold 
voltage, VSEN1 and VSEN2 pins will start to monitor 
system voltages. Once both outputs of the comparators 
are high, a 1µA (TYP) current source starts charging 
external capacitor at CD_RST pin. Once the voltage at 
CD_RST pin exceeds VRTH_RST, the nRESET outputs high 
and then another 1µA (TYP) current source starts 
charging external capacitor at CD_GATE pin. Once the 
voltage at CD_GATE pin exceeds VRTH_GATE, the GATE pin 
start to drive an external N-MOSFET with 2 × VDD 
voltage level by the charge pump circuit. The delay time 
can be calculated by equations (4) and (5):

CCD_RST and CCD_GATE are in Farads. 
When either output of the comparators is low, the 
respective capacitors start to discharge on CD_RST and 
CD_GATE pins. Once the voltage level is lower than 
1.184V (50mV Hysteresis, TYP), the nRESET and 
GATE go low. Figure 5 shows the time sequence.
