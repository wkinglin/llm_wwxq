AUGUST2014–REV.A 
GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM8711 is a low power comparator with an 
uncommitted on-chip voltage reference, which consumes 
only 2.2µA (TYP) supply current at 1.8V. The device 
can operate from 1.8V to 5.5V single supply, and is 
guaranteed to operate at 1.8V and 5V. The input common 
mode voltage range of comparator is 200mV beyond 
the supply rails. The above features make the SGM8711 
a good choice for battery-powered applications. 
The SGM8711 integrates a 1.2V series voltage reference. 
The voltage reference features a 42µV/℃ low drift. It is 
designed for driving the 10nF capacitive load with stable, 
and sourcing an output current up to 2mA (TYP). 
The SGM8711 has a push-pull output structure. It is 
capable of sinking and sourcing current when driving 
loads. 
In addition, the SGM8711 fits in a small package, so it is 
also suitable for mobile phone and handheld electronic 
devices. 
The 
SGM8711 
is 
available 
in 
a 
Green 
UTDFN-1.6×1.6-6L package. It is rated over the -40℃ to 
+85℃ temperature range. 
FEATURES 
● Low Supply Current: 2.2µA (TYP) at VS = 1.8V 
● Supply Voltage Range: 1.8V to 5.5V 
● Push-Pull Output 
● Output Drive Capability: 18mA (TYP) at VS = 5V 
● Rail-to-Rail Input and Output 
● Internal Voltage Reference: 1.2V 
● -40℃ to +85℃ Operating Temperature Range 
● Available in a Green UTDFN-1.6×1.6-6L Package

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.
