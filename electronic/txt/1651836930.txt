GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM66055B is an internally compensated, 2.2MHz 
switching frequency, current mode, synchronous Boost 
switching converter. The SGM66055B supports up to 
800mA load current from a battery as low as 2.65V, 
and the output voltage is fixed at 5.0V. This device turns 
into power-save mode to maintain high efficiency at light 
load currents. Its output is disconnected by the rectifier 
circuit during shutdown with no input to output leakage. 
The SGM66055B has built-in protection features such 
as short-circuit protection, over-current protection and 
thermal shutdown. 
The SGM66055B is available in a Green WLCSP- 
1.21×1.21-9B package.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged by ESD if you don’t 
pay attention to ESD protection. SGMICRO recommends that 
all integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because very small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet its published specifications.

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
The SGM66055B is a fully-integrated synchronous 
Boost DC/DC converter. The recommended input 
supply voltage for full performance is 2.5V to 4.85V. 
Operating input voltage above 4.85V is possible with 
SGM66055B, however, the full performance is not 
guaranteed beyond the 4.85V operation. When the 
input supply voltage is larger than 5.3V, the device is 
shut down. An inductor, an output storage capacitor 
and an input decoupling capacitor should be selected 
to ensure the proper performance desired in a specific 
application circuit. 
 
Start-up and Enable 
The SGM66055B implements the enable input to 
control the turn-on and turn-off of the device. A logic 
signal above 1.3V applied on EN pin turns on the 
device, and a logic signal below 0.4V turns off the 
device. 
 
The SGM66055B has built-in 600μs (TYP) soft-start 
time. After enabling, the SGM66055B enters linear 
pre-charge phase with a limited current of 200mA. As 
the output voltage reaches the input voltage, the 
pre-charge phase terminates. The SGM66055B starts 
switching and boosts the output voltage to the 5.0V 
fixed output. This start-up sequence effectively reduces 
the inrush current during start-up. 
 
The SGM66055B has a built-in 0.1µA (TYP) pull-down 
current when the EN pin is programmed to logic low. In 
addition to this pull-down current, there is an additional 
300kΩ pull-down resistor when EN pin is logic low. 
When EN pin is programmed to logic high, the 300kΩ 
pull-down resistor is switched off and only the 0.1µA 
(TYP) pull-down current remains. 
 
Current Limit and Short-Circuit 
The SGM66055B has a built-in 2.4A (TYP) current limit. 
As load current continues to rise and exceeds the 
current limit, output voltage will fall to maintain a 
constant power operation. As output voltage drops 
below the input voltage, current limit is reduced to 
200mA (TYP) to minimize excessive power dissipation 
within the IC. 
 
When an output short to ground event occurs, the 
SGM66055B reduces the current limit to 200mA (TYP) 
to prevent damage to the device. The SGM66055B 
resumes operation and goes through the start-up 
sequence once the short-circuit condition is removed. 
 
Inductor Selection 
Inductor is an essential element for current DC/DC 
switch mode power supplies regardless of topology. 
Inductor serves as the energy storage element for 
power conversion. Inductance and saturation current of 
inductor are two most important criterions for inductor 
selection. For general design guidance, the selected 
inductance should provide a peak to peak ripple current 
that is around 30% of the average inductor current at 
full load and nominal input voltage. The average 
inductor current for a Boost converter is the input 
current. Equation 1 shows the calculation of inductance 
selection, where fSW is the switching frequency and ΔIL 
is the inductor ripple current.

(1) 
The selected inductor should have a saturation current 
rating higher than the 2.4A (TYP) current limit of 
SGM66055B. 
The inductor also affects the close loop response of the 
DC/DC converter. The SGM66055B is an internally 
compensated device; the loop response is optimized 
for inductor in the range of 0.7µH to 2.9µH. 
 
Input Capacitor 
Boost converter’s input capacitor has continuous 
current throughout the entire switching cycle, a 10µF 
ceramic capacitor is recommended to place as close as 
possible between the VCC pin and GND pin of the 
device. For applications where the SGM66055B is 
located far away from the input source, a 47µF or 
higher capacitance capacitor is recommended to damp 
the wiring harness inductance.

Output Capacitor 
The output capacitors of Boost converter dictate the 
output voltage ripple and load transient response. 
Equation 2 is used to estimate the necessary 
capacitance to achieve desired output voltage ripple, 
where ΔV is the maximum allowed ripple.

(2) 
Since SGM66055B is an internally compensated 
device, the loop response is optimized for capacitor in 
the range of 10µF to 47µF. Due to the DC bias nature of 
ceramic capacitors, care should be taken by verifying 
manufacture’s datasheet to ensure enough effective 
capacitance at desired output voltage. 
Layout Considerations 
In addition to component selection, layout is a critical 
step to ensure the performance of any switch mode 
power supplies. Poor layout could result in system 
instability, EMI failure, and device damage. Thus, place 
the inductor, input and output capacitors as close to the 
IC as possible, and use wide and short traces for 
current carrying traces to minimize PCB inductance. 
For Boost converter, the current loop of the output 
capacitor from VOUT pin back to the PGND pin of the 
device should be as small as possible.
