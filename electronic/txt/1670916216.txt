GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM48010 is a high-speed gate driver capable of 
effectively driving MOSFET and IGBT power switches. 
It allows for up to 8A source and 12A sink peak currents 
at VDD = 20V. The SGM48010 provides a comprehensive 
set of protection features such as over-voltage 
protection, thermal shutdown protection, under-voltage 
lockout and short-circuit protection. It operates with a 
wide supply voltage of 4.5V to 20V. 
The SGM48010 is available in a Green TDFN-2×2-6L 
package. It operates over a temperature range of -40℃ 
to +125℃.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.

PIN DESCRIPTION

NAME 
TYPE 
FUNCTION 
1 
VDD 
P 
Power Supply Input for Driver. Place a decoupling capacitor (CIN = 4.7μF) between this pin and GND pin 
close to the device. 
2 
IN 
I 
Logic Input for Gate Control. A logic high forces the GD output low if driving is not disabled by SOV or 
SYNC. This pin is a self-holding input and its status changes only when both input current and voltage 
exceed the desired thresholds. 
3 
SYNC 
I 
Deadtime Lock Input to Prevent Shoot Through. If SYNC is high, the GD output is inhibited. Similar to IN, 
this input is also self-holding and its status changes only when both input current and voltage exceed the 
desired thresholds. 
4 
SOV 
IO 
1. Input for MOSFET/IGBT On and Off Over-Voltage Detection. When the over-voltage of MOSFET 
drain/IGBT collector is sensed, the GD output temporarily goes low after a blanking time. 
2. Output for Protection Status Indication. If any protection is in action, including over-voltage protection, 
thermal shutdown protection, under-voltage lockout and short-circuit protection, the pin is driven high. 
5 
GD 
O 
Gate Drive Output. Connect it to the gate of the switch. 
6 
GND 
G 
Ground.

The exposed pad should be soldered to the ground plane. 
 
NOTE:
