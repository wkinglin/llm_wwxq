NOVEMBER 2023 – REV. A 
GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM8610-2 is a dual, low noise operational 
amplifier. The device is optimized for low voltage 
operation from 2.5V to 5.5V single supply or ±1.25V to 
±2.75V dual power supplies. It has a 1.8mA typical 
quiescent current. The SGM8610-2 supports rail-to-rail 
input and output operation. 
The SGM8610-2 is unity-gain stable and offers an 
8.5MHz gain-bandwidth product and 4.8V/µs slew rate. 
It also offers an ultra-low input bias current. 
Furthermore, the SGM8610-2 features high speed and 
low power. It is designed for a variety of applications, such 
as battery-powered equipment, portable equipment, 
sensor interfaces and active filters. 
The SGM8610-2 is available in Green UTDFN-2×2-8BL 
and SOIC-8 packages. It is specified over the extended 
-40℃ to +125℃ temperature range.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
Rail-to-Rail Input 
When SGM8610-2 works at the power supply between 
2.5V and 5.5V, the input common mode voltage range 
is from (-VS) - 0.1V to (+VS) + 0.1V. In Figure 1, the ESD 
diodes between the inputs and the power supply rails 
will clamp the input voltage not to exceed the rails. 
 
 
 
Figure 1. Input Equivalent Circuit 
 
Input Current-Limit Protection 
For ESD diode clamping protection, when the current 
flowing through ESD diode exceeds the maximum 
rating value, the ESD diode and amplifier will be 
damaged, so current-limit protection will be added in 
some applications. One resistor is selected to limit the 
current not to exceed the maximum rating value. In 
Figure 2, a series input resistor is used to limit the input 
current to less than 10mA, but the drawback of this 
current-limit resistor is that it contributes thermal noise 
at the amplifier input. If this resistor must be added, its 
value must be selected as small as possible. 
 
 
 
Figure 2. Input Current-Limit Protection 
 
Rail-to-Rail Output 
The SGM8610-2 supports rail-to-rail output operation. 
In single power supply application, for example, when 
+VS = 5.5V, -VS = GND, 10kΩ load resistor is tied from 
OUT pin to VS/2, the typical output swing range is from 
0.007V to 5.493V. 
 
Driving Capacitive Loads 
The SGM8610-2 is designed for driving the 1000pF 
capacitive load with unity-gain stable. If greater 
capacitive load must be driven in application, the circuit 
in Figure 3 can be used. In this circuit, the IR drop 
voltage generated by RISO is compensated by feedback 
loop. 
 
 
 
Figure 3. Circuit to Drive Heavy Capacitive Load 
 
Power Supply Decoupling and Layout 
A clean and low noise power supply is very important in 
amplifier circuit design, besides of input signal noise, 
the power supply is one of important source of noise to 
the amplifiers through +VS and -VS pins. Power supply 
bypassing is an effective method to clear up the noise 
at power supply, and the low impedance path to ground 
of decoupling capacitor will bypass the noise to GND. 
In application, 10μF ceramic capacitor paralleled with 
0.1μF or 0.01μF ceramic capacitor is used in Figure 4. 
The ceramic capacitors should be placed as close as 
possible to +VS and -VS power supply pins.

APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued) 
Grounding 
In low speed application, one node grounding technique 
is the simplest and most effective method to eliminate 
the noise generated by grounding. In high speed 
application, the general method to eliminate noise is to 
use a complete ground plane technique, and the whole 
ground plane will help distribute heat and reduce EMI 
noise pickup. 
 
Reduce Input-to-Output Coupling 
To reduce the input-to-output coupling, the input traces 
must be placed as far away from the power supply or 
output traces as possible. The sensitive trace must not 
be placed in parallel with the noisy trace in same layer. 
They must be placed perpendicularly in different layers 
to reduce the crosstalk. These PCB layout techniques 
will help to reduce unwanted positive feedback and 
noise. 
 
Typical Application Circuits 
Difference Amplifier 
The circuit in Figure 5 is a design example of classical 
difference amplifier. If R4/R3 = R2/R1, then VOUT = (VP - 
VN) × R2/R1 + VREF. 
 
 
 
Figure 5. Difference Amplifier 
 
High Input Impedance Difference Amplifier 
The circuit in Figure 6 is a design example of high input 
impedance difference amplifier. The added amplifiers at 
the input are used to increase the input impedance and 
eliminate drawback of low input impedance in Figure 5. 
 
 
 
Figure 6. High Input Impedance Difference Amplifier 
 
Active Low-Pass Filter 
The circuit in Figure 7 is a design example of active 
low-pass filter, the DC gain is equal to -R2/R1 and the 
-3dB corner frequency is equal to 1/2πR2C. In this design, 
the filter bandwidth must be less than the bandwidth of 
the amplifier, and the resistor values must be selected 
as low as possible to reduce ringing or oscillation 
generated by the parasitic parameters in PCB layout.
