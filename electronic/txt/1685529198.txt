GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM61235 is an adaptive constant on-time control 
(ACOT) synchronous Buck converter with a wide input 
voltage range of 4.5V to 28V. This device has 3A 
output current capability and operates at pseudo-fixed 
frequency. It is an easy-to-use device with power 
switches and internal compensation circuit, which are 
all integrated in a small 6-pin package, and supports 
low-equivalent series resistance (ESR) output capacitors. 
A typical 5ms soft-start ramp is also included to 
minimize the inrush current. 
Protection features include cycle-by-cycle current limit, 
hiccup current-protection mode, output over-voltage 
protection and thermal shutdown in case of excessive 
power dissipation. 
The SGM61235A enters in pulse-skip mode (PSM) to 
improve efficiency during light load operation, while the 
SGM61235B works in continuous current mode (CCM) 
to achieve low output ripple and good regulation. 
The SGM61235 is available in a Green TSOT-23-6 
package.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
Overview 
The SGM61235 is a 28V, 3A synchronous Buck 
converter with over-current, short-circuit and thermal 
shutdown with auto recovery. Figure 2 shows the 
simplified block diagram of the SGM61235. The two 
integrated MOSFET switches of the power stage 
(62mΩ high-side and 32mΩ low-side) can provide up to 
3A of continuous current with high efficiency. 
The device is powered up when VIN exceeds the UVLO 
threshold (4.07V TYP). At light load condition, the 
SGM61235A enters in pulse-skip mode (PSM) to 
improve efficiency, while the SGM61235B works in 
continuous current mode (CCM) to achieve low output 
ripple and good regulation. At no load and with no 
switching, the typical operating current of SGM61235A 
is 45μA (TYP) and when the device is disabled by EN 
pin, it is only 3µA (TYP). The internal ripple injection 
minimizes the BOM cost and simplifies the design. The 
inrush current is also limited by an internal 5ms 
soft-start ramp. 
 
Adaptive Constant On-Time Control 
In conventional voltage mode control (VMC) or current 
mode control (CMC) converters, a fixed frequency 
clock timing signal generates a saw-tooth ramp that is 
compared with the compensation network output to 
adjust the PWM duty cycle (on-time) as control variable 
and regulate the output voltage and/or current 
feedback(s) to govern the control variable and keep the 
output regulated with fast reaction to load or VIN 
variations. The existence of the compensator in VMC or 
CMC converter inherently introduces some delay in the 
loop response. 
The adaptive constant on-time (ACOT) control differs 
from voltage mode control (VMC) or current mode 
control (CMC) in that it operates without clock signal 
and instead uses hysteretic mode control. At the start of 
each switching cycle, the ACOT control generates a 
relatively constant on-time pulse when the internal 
comparator detects that the output voltage has dropped 
below the desired level. The feedback (FB) pin senses 
the output voltage through a resistor divider and 
compares it to the internal reference voltage (VREF) 
using a low-gain error amplifier. The amplifier output is 
then sent to a comparator. When the feedback voltage 
(VFB) falls below the amplifier output, the on-time 
control logic is triggered which turns on the high-side 
switch. ACOT control can dynamically adjust the 
on-time duration based on the input and output voltage, 
achieving a relatively constant frequency during 
steady-state operation and minimizing electromagnetic 
interference at certain frequencies. Additionally, an 
internal ramp is added to the reference voltage to 
simulate output ripple, allowing for use with low 
equivalent series resistance (ESR) output capacitors. 
 
Enable Pin and UVLO Adjustment 
The EN pin can be used to turn the device on and off or 
to change the UVLO thresholds. The device is enabled 
when the EN pin voltage exceeds its high threshold. A 
low EN voltage disables the device and brings it to the 
shutdown state. 
The EN pin is internally pulled up by a small current 
source (IIL) so the device is enabled if EN pin is floated. 
An open-drain or open collector output can be used to 
control the EN pin. 
VIN is monitored by the internal under-voltage lockout 
circuit and if it is below UVLO threshold, the device is 
disabled. The internal UVLO has a 320mV hysteresis. If 
higher thresholds are needed, EN pin can be used as 
shown in Figure 3.

to calculate the R1 and R2 values for the desired UVLO 
low (VUV_L) and high (VUV_H) thresholds.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Bootstrap Voltage (BOOT) 
To power the upper switch gate driver, a voltage higher 
than VIN is needed. Bootstrap technique is used to 
provide this voltage from the switching node by using a 
0.1μF bootstrap capacitor between SW and BOOT pins 
along with an internal bootstrap diode. The voltage is 
internally regulated for driving the high-side switch. An 
X5R or X7R ceramic capacitor is recommended for 
CBOOT to have stable capacitance against temperature 
and voltage variations. 
 
Output Voltage Programming 
The output voltage is set by a resistor divider between 
VOUT and GND that is tapped to the FB pin. It is 
recommended to use 1% or higher quality resistors with 
low thermal tolerance for an accurate and thermally 
stable output voltage. 
Use Equation 3 and Figure 4 to calculate the output 
voltage. Lower divider resistor values increase loss and 
reduce light load efficiency. Consider larger resistors to 
improve efficiency at light load, and start with 100kΩ for 
the upper resistor (RFB1). Note that if RFB1 is too high (> 
1MΩ), the FB pin leakage current and other noises can 
easily affect the accuracy and performance of the 
regulator.

Internal Voltage Reference and Soft-Start 
The SGM61235 device has an internal 0.594V 
reference (VREF) to program the output at the desired 
level. When the converter starts (or is enabled), an 
internal ramp voltage begins to rise from near 0V to 
slightly above 0.594V with a ramp time of 5ms. The 
lower of VREF and this ramp is used as reference for the 
error amplifier, therefore, during startup the ramp 
provides a soft-start for the output. The soft-start is 
essential to prevent high inrush currents caused by 
rapid increase of output voltage across output 
capacitors and the load.  
 
Over-Current and Short-Circuit Protection 
The SGM61235 supports overload mode. When the 
output current continues overload while the system 
power-up, the SGM61235 exports the maximize power 
and limits the maximum valley current of the low-side 
FET switch. The device keeps in cycle-by-cycle limit to 
meet the system’s power request. The SGM61235 
does not shut down until the device heats and then 
goes to thermal shutdown. As the load increases 
continuously, the output voltage decreases. If the 
output voltage drops to 50% of VREF and the current of 
the low-side switch is higher than the low-side current 
limit 
for 
512 
consecutive 
cycles, 
the 
hiccup 
current-protection mode will be activated. In hiccup 
mode, the regulator is shut down and kept off for 7ms 
typically before the SGM61235 tries to start again. If 
over-current or a short-circuit fault condition still exists, 
the hiccup mode will repeat until the fault condition is 
removed. Hiccup mode can help to reduce power 
dissipation and prevent overheating and potential 
damage to the device. 
 
Output Over-Voltage Protection (OVP) 
An over-voltage protection is included in the device to 
minimize the output voltage overshoots that may occur 
after recovery from an output fault or a large unloading 
transient. The FB pin voltage is compared with the OVP 
thresholds. If the VFB exceeds 108% of the VREF, the 
high-side switch is forced to turn off, and the low-side 
switch is turned on until zero cross current limit 
(SGM61235A) or negative current limit (SGM61235B) 
is triggered. When the VFB falls below 104% of the 
VREF, the high-side switch is allowed to turn on again.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Light Load Operation with Pulse-Skip 
Mode (SGM61235A) 
When 
SGM61235A 
operates 
in 
discontinuous 
conduction mode (DCM) with light loads, it goes into 
the pulse-skip mode (PSM) in which internal power 
dissipation is significantly reduced. Moreover, the 
operating frequency starts to drop depending on the 
load. At very light load and when the off-time exceeds 
10μs, device goes to the sleep mode to lower internal 
dissipation. 
The details are explained in Figure 5 that shows the 
timings of the ACOT control in DCM. Inductor current (IL) 
is monitored with a zero-crossing detector and when IL 
crosses the zero and VFB > VREF_EA (the output of the 
low-gain error amplifier), both high-side and low-side 
MOSFETs are turned off. They will not turn on again 
until the VFB falls below VREF_EA and triggers a new 
on-time 
pulse. 
During 
this 
off-time 
period, 
all 
non-essential circuits are shut down to minimize losses 
and the load is supplied by the output capacitor stored 
energy. The control circuitry wakes up when the new 
on-pulse is triggered. When the time between 
successive high-side pulses (t1) is longer than 10μs, 
the device goes into sleep mode in which the system 
current dissipation is only about 45μA. 
 
Figure 5. Pulse-Skip Mode in DCM 
Light Load Operation with Continuous 
Current Mode (SGM61235B) 
The SGM61235B is locked in continuous current mode 
from full load to no load. Negative inductor currents are 
allowed at light load to keep continuous inductor 
current operation. It is a tradeoff that sacrifices light 
load efficiency for keeping switching frequency 
relatively fixed, lower output ripple, and better output 
regulation. To avoid fatal negative current in the 
low-side switch, this current is limited at -1A (TYP). 
 
Thermal Shutdown 
If the junction temperature exceeds +170℃ (TYP), the 
device is forced to stop switching. It will recover 
automatically when TJ falls below the recovery threshold.

Design Requirements 
A typical application circuit for the SGM61235 as a 
Buck converter is shown in Figure 6. It is used for 
converting an 8V to 28V supply voltage to a lower 
voltage level supply voltage (5V) suitable for the 
system. The design parameters given in Table 2 are 
used for this design example.

Input Capacitor Selection 
A high-quality ceramic capacitor (X5R or X7R or 
better dielectric grade) must be used for input 
decoupling of the SGM61235. At least 3μF of 
effective capacitance (after de-ratings) is needed on 
the VIN input. In some applications, additional bulk 
capacitance may also be required for the VIN input, 
for example, when the SGM61235 is more than 5cm 
away from the input source. The VIN capacitor ripple 
current rating must also be greater than the maximum 
input current ripple. The input current ripple can be 
calculated using Equation 4 and the maximum value 
occurs at 50% duty cycle. Using the design example 
values, IOUT = 3A, yields an RMS input ripple current 
of 1.5A.

APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued) 
For this design, a ceramic capacitor with at least 50V 
voltage rating is required to support the maximum 
input voltage. So, a 10µF/50V capacitor is selected 
for VIN to cover all DC bias, thermal and aging 
de-ratings. The input capacitance determines the 
regulator input voltage ripple. This ripple can be 
calculated from Equation 5. In this example, the total 
effective capacitance of the 10µF/50V capacitor is 
around 4µF at 12V input, and the input voltage ripple 
is 260mV.

It recommended placing an additional small size 
0.1µF ceramic capacitor right beside VIN and GND 
pins for high frequency filtering. 
 
Inductor Selection 
Equation 6 is conventionally used to calculate the 
output inductance of a Buck converter. The ratio of 
inductor current ripple (∆IL) to the maximum output 
current (IOUT) is represented as KIND factor (∆IL/IOUT). 
The inductor ripple current is bypassed and filtered by 
the output capacitor and the inductor DC current is 
passed to the output. Inductor ripple is selected 
based on a few considerations. The peak inductor 
current (IOUT + ∆IL/2) must have a safe margin from 
the saturation current of the inductor in the worst-case 
conditions especially if a hard-saturation core type 
inductor (such as ferrite) is chosen. The ripple current 
also affects the selection of the output capacitor. COUT 
RMS current rating must be higher than the inductor 
RMS ripple. Typically, a 40% ripple is selected (KIND = 
0.4).

In this example, the calculated inductance will be

current calculations are summarized in Equations 7, 8 
and 9 respectively.

Note that during startup, load transients or fault 
conditions, the peak inductor current may exceed the 
calculated IL_PEAK. Therefore, it is always safer to 
choose the inductor saturation current higher than the 
switch current limit. 
 
Output Capacitor Selection 
The output capacitors and inductor filter the AC part 
of the PWM switching voltage and provide an 
acceptable 
level 
of 
output 
voltage 
ripple 
superimposed on the desired output DC voltage. 
Additionally, the capacitors store energy to assist in 
maintaining output voltage regulation during load 
transient. The output voltage ripple (ΔVOUT) depends 
on the output capacitor value at the operating voltage, 
temperature (℃) and its parasitic parameters (ESR 
and ESL):

The voltage rating of the output capacitors should be 
selected with enough margins to ensure that 
capacitance drop (voltage and temperature de-rating) 
is not significant. The type of output capacitors will 
determine which terms of Equation 10 are dominant. 
For ceramic output capacitors, the ESR and ESL are 
virtually zero, so the output voltage ripple will be 
dominated by the capacitive term. 
To reduce the voltage ripple, either inductance or the 
total capacitance is increased. For electrolytic output 
capacitors, the value of capacitance is relatively high, 
and compared with ESR and ESL terms, the third 
term in Equation 10 can be ignored: 
Higher quality capacitors, larger inductance or using 
parallel capacitors can help reduce the output ripple 
in a design using electrolytic output capacitors.

can be quite high, and it is recommended using 
quality capacitors with the ESR or the total 
impedance clearly documented in the datasheet. ESR 
of an electrolytic capacitor may increase significantly 
at cold ambient temperatures with a factor of 10 or so, 
which increases the ripple and can deteriorate the 
regulator stability. 
The transient response of the regulator also depends 
on the quantity and type of output capacitors. In 
general, reducing the ESR of the output capacitance 
will lead to a better transient response. The ESR can 
be minimized by simply adding more capacitors in 
parallel or by using higher quality capacitors. When a 
fast load transient of magnitude ΔIL and rate of di/dt 
occurs, the output voltage will jump or dip by a 
transient magnitude of ΔVOUT:

Right after the transient, the inductor current remains 
almost constant especially for larger inductors and the 
transient current is carried by the capacitor. The 
output voltage will deviate from its nominal value for a 
short time depending on the system bandwidth, the 
inductor and the output capacitance. Eventually, the 
error amplifier and feedback bring the output voltage 
back to its nominal value. A higher bandwidth is 
usually preferred to get shorter settling time, however, 
it may be more difficult to get acceptable gain and 
phase margins. In this example, according to Table 1, 
2 × 22μF/16V X5R ceramic capacitors with 2mΩ of 
ESR can meet the above conditions. 
 
Bootstrap Capacitor Selection 
Use a 0.1μF high-quality ceramic capacitor (X5R or 
X7R) with 10V or higher voltage rating for the 
bootstrap capacitor (C3).  
VIN UVLO Setting 
The input UVLO can be programmed by using an 
external voltage divider on the EN pin of the 
SGM61235. In this design, R1 is connected between 
VIN pin and EN pin and R2 is connected between EN 
pin and GND (see Figure 6). The UVLO has two 
thresholds (hysteresis), one for power-up (turn-on) 
when the input voltage is rising and one for 
power-down (turn-off) when the voltage is falling. In 
this design, the turn-on (enable to start switching) 
occurs when VIN rises above 8V (UVLO rising 
threshold). When the regulator is working, it will not 
stop switching (disabled) until the input falls below 7V 
(UVLO falling threshold). Equations 1 and 2 are 
provided to calculate the resistors. For this example, 
the nearest standard resistor values are R1 = 240kΩ 
and R2 = 41.2kΩ. 
 
Output Voltage Setting 
Use an external resistor divider (R3 and R4) to set the 
output voltage using Equation 14:

where VREF = 0.594V is the internal reference. For 
example, by choosing R3 = 100kΩ, the R4 value for 
5V output will be calculated as 13.7kΩ. 
 
Feed-Forward Capacitor Selection 
The SGM61235 contains an internal compensation 
circuit, an internal ramp is added to reference voltage 
to simulate output ripple. For ultra-low output 
capacitance ESR (ceramic capacitor) applications, it 
is recommended adding a 56pF feed-forward 
capacitor (C6) to provide a low-impedance path for 
output voltage ripple and ensure minimal phase shift 
of the voltage ripple at the feedback node while 
maintaining acceptable transient response.

APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued) 
Layout Guide 
PCB is an essential element of any switching power supply. The converter operation can be significantly disturbed 
due to the existence of the large and fast rising/falling voltages that can couple through stray capacitances to other 
signal paths, and also due to the large and fast changing currents that can interact through parasitic magnetic 
couplings, unless those interferences are minimized and properly managed in the layout design. Insufficient 
conductance in copper traces for the high current paths results in high resistive losses in the power paths and 
voltage errors. The following guidelines provided here are necessary to design a good layout: 
 
Bypass VIN pin to GND pin with low-ESR ceramic capacitors (X5R or X7R better dielectric) placed as close as 
possible to VIN pin. 
 
Use short, wide and direct traces for high-current connections (IN, SW and GND). 
 
Keep the BOOT-SW voltage path as short as possible. 
 
Place the feedback resistors as close as possible to the FB pin that is sensitive to noise. 
 
Minimize the area and path length of the loop formed by VIN pin, bypass capacitors connections and SW pin.
