JUNE2022–REV.A.2 
 
GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM6033 is a high-efficient Buck switching 
voltage regulator, supporting up to 1A output current 
and adjustable output voltage. This device is 
capable for an input voltage supply range of 2.5V to 
5.5V. The 4.6MHz PWM mode frequency operation 
allows the use of a 470nH output inductor and a 
4.7μF output capacitor. 
The SGM6033 operates in power-save mode under 
moderate and light load conditions through pulse 
frequency modulation (PFM). The 26μA typical 
quiescent current and the power-save mode can 
further improve the system efficiency which can 
reach a maximum of 90%. The SGM6033 has 
excellent load transient response capability. The 
SGM6033 
also 
includes 
features 
of 
internal 
soft-start, input under-voltage lockout, thermal 
shutdown and overload protection. 
The SGM6033 is available in Green TDFN-2×2-6L and 
WLCSP-1.21×0.81-6B packages. It operates over an 
ambient temperature range of -40℃ to +125℃.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.

SGM6033 
4.6MHz, 1A Synchronous Buck Regulator 
 
 
10 
JUNE 2022 
SG Micro Corp 
www.sg-micro.com 
DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
The SGM6033 is a synchronous Buck converter 
capable of delivering 1A load to the output from an 
input supply range from 2.5V to 5.5V. The SGM6033 
integrates a synchronous rectifier to improve the 
conversion efficiency up to 90% peak, while PFM mode 
light load efficiency reaches over 80% at 1mA load.  
The device operates with 4.6MHz switching frequency 
at PWM mode which significantly reduces the external 
components size. The device only needs a 470nH 
inductor and 2 × 4.7μF as the output capacitors. 
Control Scheme 
The SGM6033 adopts the COT architecture to regulate 
the output voltage while maintaining excellent load 
transient response. The device’s internal frequency 
loop keeps the switching frequency constant at 4.6MHz 
throughout the input voltage range and load current. 
The device allows the use of low ESR ceramic 
capacitor to maintain output voltage regulation.  
At light load, the SGM6033 automatically operates in 
PFM mode to achieve high light load efficiency. The 
device can seamlessly transit to PFM, DCM or CCM 
based on the load current.  
 
Soft-Start 
Toggling the EN pin above the 1.5V rising threshold, 
the device starts switching with an internal soft-start 
time. During start-up, the internal reference voltage is 
slowly ramped up to the 0.8V reference voltage to 
prevent any output voltage overshoot and reduce the 
inrush current drawn from the input.  
The current limit protection is active during soft-start, 
the device might not start up properly if heavy load is 
applied during start-up. 
 
Current Limit, Fault Shutdown and Restart 
Output short-to-ground or output over-current will 
cause the peak inductor current flowing through the 
high-side switch to reach the current limit. If the current 
limit is triggered, the device stops switching, turning off 
the high-side FET to prevent the inductor current from 
continuing to rise. During the over-current event, the 
regulator shuts down for about 1.3ms, and the soft-start 
circuit attempts to restart for 200μs. If the over-current 
event remains, this pattern repeats, and the device 
automatically 
resumes 
operation 
if 
over-current 
condition is removed. 
Under-Voltage Lockout (UVLO) 
The SGM6033 implements input voltage UVLO to stop 
device operation when the input voltage drops below 
the UVLO threshold. The device cannot restart again 
until the input voltage raises higher than the additional 
170mV (TYP) hysteresis.  
Thermal Shutdown (TSD) 
A thermal shutdown function is implemented to prevent 
damage caused by excessive heat and power dissipation. 
Once a temperature of typically +160°C is exceeded, 
the device is shut down. The device is released from 
shutdown automatically when the junction temperature 
decreases by 15℃.

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
Setting the Output Voltage 
The output voltage is programmed using a resistive 
voltage divider from the output voltage to FB pin. The 
voltage divider divides the output voltage down to the 
feedback voltage by the ratio:

where VFB is the feedback voltage and VOUT is the 
output voltage. Thus the output voltage is:

The recommended value for R2 is between 200kΩ to 
500kΩ. 
 
Selecting the Inductor 
The selected inductor should have enough saturation 
current rating to meet the maximum load current. In 
addition, the selected inductor value affects the peak 
current, PWM to PFM transition point and efficiency. 
Use Equation below to calculate the inductor ripple 
current:

When the inductor’s valley current crosses zero, the 
device transits from PFM to PWM operation. Use

inductor current reaches zero:

470nH 
is 
recommended 
for 
SGM6033. 
For 
application’s duty cycle higher than 60%, 1μH inductor 
is recommended. In addition, the recommended 
maximum operation duty cycle for SGM6033 is 75%. 
The selected inductor should have at least 80% of the 
inductance at ILIM(PK). 
Inductor’s DCR and inductance affect the conversion 
efficiency. Inductor with lower inductance generally has 
lower DCR which improves the efficiency, however, the 
RMS current is increased due to increased peak to 
peak ripple current ΔI. Higher ΔI increases the inductor 
core loss which reduces the efficiency. Use Equation 
below to calculate the inductor RMS current:

Higher inductance results in lower RMS current, 
however, transient response is degraded. For the same 
family of inductors, higher inductance parts result in 
higher DCR and lower saturation current.  
Table 1 summarizes the performance effects of 
inductance higher or lower than the recommended 
0.47μH inductor.

Input Capacitor 
A 2.2μF ceramic input capacitor is recommended to 
place as close as possible between the VIN pin and 
GND to minimize the parasitic inductance. For the 
applications where the SGM6033 is located far away 
from the input source, a 47µF or higher capacitance 
capacitor is recommended to damp the wiring 
harness’s inductance.  
 
Output Capacitor 
A 
4.7μF 
0402 
ceramic 
output 
capacitor 
is 
recommended for SGM6033. Larger size as 0603 
results in higher effective capacitance under the same 
DC de-rating, which improves transient response and 
output ripple. 
Use Equation below to calculate the output voltage 
ripple:

PCB Layout Guidelines 
In addition to component selection, layout is a critical 
step to ensure the performance of any switch mode 
power supplies. Poor layout could result in system 
instability, EMI failure, and device damage. Thus, place 
the inductor, input and output capacitors as close to the 
IC as possible, and use wide and short traces for 
current carrying traces to minimize PCB inductance. 
For Buck converter, the input capacitor’s current loop 
from VIN pin back to the GND pin of the device should 
be as small as possible.
