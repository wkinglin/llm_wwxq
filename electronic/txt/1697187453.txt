OCTOBER 2023 – REV. A. 1 
GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM8771 is a single, high precision voltage 
comparator with a 1.225V voltage reference. The device 
optimized for high voltage operation from 2.8V to 36V 
single supply or ±1.4V to ±18V dual power supplies. It 
consumes low supply current without being affected by 
the supply voltage. Input common mode voltage is 1.5V 
lower than +VS. The SGM8771 has an open-drain 
output structure that needs external pull-up resistor. It 
also has a 1.225V voltage reference that saves 
external reference and reduces system cost. 
The SGM8771 features low input offset voltage of 
2.4mV (MAX). It is suitable for applications requiring 
precision. 
The SGM8771 is available in Green SOIC-8 and 
TDFN-3×3-8L packages. It is operated over the -40℃ 
to +125℃ temperature range.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
The SGM8771 is a single, high precision, low power 
comparator. The wide input voltage range and power 
supply range make the device a good choice for industrial 
equipment. Open-drain structure needs external pull-up 
resistor. The SGM8771 can be compatible with CMOS 
and TTL logics. 
 
Output Structure 
In Figure 1, the SGM8771 has an open-drain output 
stage. When output is changed from logic high to low, 
the changed sink current pulls output pin to logic low. 
Beginning this transition, larger sink current is used to 
create a high slew rate transit from high to low. Once 
the output voltage reaches VOL, it will reduce the sink 
current to a just right value to maintain the VOL static 
condition. This current-driven open-drain output stage will 
significantly reduce the power consumption in application 
system. 
If low slew rate transition is needed in system design, 
adjusting the load capacitance will change the slew rate. 
The heavier capacitive load will slow down the output 
voltage transition. This feature will be used to reduce 
the interference generated by fast edge of transition 
between 1 and 0 in noise-sensitive system.

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
Layout and Bypassing 
Good power supply decoupling, layout and grounding 
are very important for SGM8771 to realize the full 
high-speed capabilities in system, following skills will be 
used: 
 A 0.1µF to 4.7µF range ceramic capacitor is used to 
provide good power supply decoupling. This ceramic 
capacitor must be placed as close to +VS pin as 
possible. 
 For grounding, unbroken and low-inductance ground 
plane is a good choice. 
 For Layout, use short PCB trace to avoid unwanted 
parasitic feedback around the comparator. SGM8771 
must be soldered directly to the PCB and the socket is 
not recommended.
