NOVEMBER 2023 – REV. A 
GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM25006 is a single channel power distribution 
switch. The switch operates from a wide range of 2.5V 
to 6.5V supply voltage, and is controlled by the nEN/EN 
pin. The rise time and fall time of the device are 
controlled internally to avoid inrush current. 
An integrated charge pump biases the N-MOSFET 
switch in order to achieve a low switch RDSON. This 
device provides the adjustable current limit threshold 
between 500mA and 5A through the RILIM. If the load 
current is higher than the current limit threshold, the 
device will limit the output current to a safe level and 
enter into constant-current mode. Fault conditions such 
as over-current and over-temperature are indicated by 
the nFAULT pin. 
The SGM25006 is available in a Green TDFN-3×3-8FL 
package.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
Overview 
The SGM25006 is an N-MOSFET power switch with 
current limit function. It has the adjustable current limit 
threshold from 0.5A to 5A with an external resistor. To 
drive the built-in MOSFET, a charge pump and gate 
driver is used. The charge pump supplies voltage for 
the driving circuit and lifts the MOSFET gate voltage 
above the source voltage. The charge pump can work 
well even the input voltage is down to 2.5V and very 
small supply current is needed. The gate driver 
determines the MOSFET gate voltage and rising and 
falling times of the output to avoid the large current and 
voltage spikes. Consequently, an internal soft-start is 
realized. 
The SGM25006 has a configurable current limit (IOS) in 
case of over-current and short-circuit conditions. To 
limit the output current, the voltage of the charge pump 
driving N-MOSFET decreases, causing N-MOSFET to 
operate in the linear region, which leads to the drop of 
the output voltage because the MOSFET is not 
completely enhanced. 
 
Over-Current Conditions 
The SGM25006 limits the output current to IOS under 
short-circuit or over-current condition. Once an 
over-current event occurs, the output current is 
constant 
while 
the 
output 
voltage 
decreases 
correspondingly. There are two possible conditions of 
over-current. 
The first condition is that a short-circuit or an over- 
current condition appears before the power-up process. 
In this case, the output voltage is limited to almost zero 
potential and the output current starts to ramp up to IOS. 
The output current keeps its value at IOS unless no 
over-current condition is detected or a new thermal 
cycle begins. 
The second condition is that a short-circuit or an over- 
current condition suddenly appears when the device is 
in the normal operation. Within the time tIOS depicted in 
Figure 4, the current sense amplifier is overdriven and 
the N-MOSFET is closed. The current sense amplifier 
recovers and the output current increases linearly to IOS. 
The output current keeps its value at IOS unless no 
over-current condition is detected or a new thermal 
cycle begins. 
If a short-circuit or an overload condition exists for a 
long time to activate thermal protection, the SGM25006 
thermal cycles. The device will be shut off when the 
junction temperature (TJ) is higher than +135℃ and 
will not recover until TJ is lower than +115℃. The 
SGM25006 keeps thermal cycling unless the over- 
current condition is eliminated. 
 
nFAULT Response 
The SGM25006 uses the nFAULT as a fault flag to 
monitor the over-current or over-temperature condition. 
The nFAULT is an open-drain pin and is active low 
once a fault condition occurs. When the false condition 
is removed, the device returns to normal operation 
again. A built-in delay deglitch circuit is adopted to 
avoid the false nFAULT report for over-current 
condition (11ms, TYP). As a result, the nFAULT will not 
be asserted under normal condition such as starting 
with a large capacitive load. The nFAULT signal is not 
deglitched 
when 
entering 
the 
over-temperature 
condition but deglitched when exiting the over- 
temperature condition, which effectively avoids the 
nFAULT oscillation under over-temperature condition. 
 
Under-Voltage Lockout (UVLO) 
The under-voltage lockout (UVLO) circuit shuts off the 
N-MOSFET unless the input voltage exceeds the 
UVLO positive threshold. An internal hysteresis 
prevents the undesired restart for the input drop in the 
power on progress. 
 
Enable (nEN or EN) 
The enable pin controls the N-MOSFET and supply 
current. For SGM25006B, when nEN is low, the driver, 
control circuits and power switch is activated. When 
nEN is high, the device is shut off and the supply 
current is less than 3μA. The nEN pin is compatible 
with TTL and CMOS logic levels.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Thermal Sense 
The SGM25006 uses two independent thermal circuits 
for self-protection, monitors the operating temperature 
of the power switch, and stops operation when TJ 
exceeds the recommended operating conditions. Note 
that the device keeps the output current constant under 
over-current conditions, which increases the voltage 
drop across the power switch. Due to the power 
dissipation increases linearly with the increase of the 
voltage drop across the power switch, TJ rises a lot 
under an over-current condition. The first thermal 
sensor (OTSD-1), will turn off the power switch once 
the device temperature is higher than +135℃ in a 
current limit status. After the device temperature drops 
to +115℃, the power switch will be turned on again. 
The second thermal sensor (OTSD-2) will turn off the 
power switch once the device temperature is higher 
than +155℃ no matter the device is in a current limit 
status or not. After the device temperature drops to 
+135℃, the power switch will be turned on again. 
The SGM25006 remains in thermal cycles unless the 
over-temperature condition is removed.

Input and Output Capacitance 
Adding capacitors to the input and output is beneficial 
to the system device, but the actual capacitor needs to 
be optimized for more concrete condition. A 0.1μF 
ceramic capacitor is recommended to be placed as 
close as possible to the device input pin to suppress 
the rings caused by the source variations. A larger 
capacitor is needed to reduce the large overshoot that 
may exceed the absolute maximum voltage caused by 
heavy transients especially in bench testing with long 
and inductive cables. 
Generally, the output capacitor is not required. However, if 
a large transient current condition is considered, a large 
electrolytic capacitor is recommended on the output pin. 
 
Adjustable Current Limit 
The SGM25006 changes the current limit threshold 
through an external resistor (RILIM). The current limit 
threshold is proportional to the current sourced out of 
the ILIM pin. The device provides a controlled voltage 
on the ILIM pin through the internal regulation loop. In 
order to guarantee the ILIM loop stability, choose a 
resistor with 1% resolution within the range of 20kΩ ~ 
187kΩ. To ensure that the current limit completely falls 
into the defined range, the resistor tolerance should be 
taken into consideration seriously. The formula of 
current limit threshold is approximated in Equation 1 
and some specific settings can be found in Electrical 
Characteristics 
section. 
Because 
the 
parasitic 
parameters may affect the current limit threshold 
accuracy, please route the traces of RILIM as close to 
the chip as possible.

Designing Above a IOS(MIN) 
In some cases, a minimum current limit is required. In 
this example, a current of 3A is planned to be 
transferred to the output. Obviously, now the minimum 
current limit threshold is 3000mA. Equation 2 depicts 
how to use IOS to choose a suitable RILIM.

Choose the resistor of 1% resolution that is closest to 
the value calculated from Equation 2 and get the result 
of RILIM = 34.8kΩ. Hence, the requirement of minimum 
current limit of 3000mA is met. Then, we need to 
calculate the maximum current limit with IOS, RILIM that 
has been calculated in Equation 2.

a resistor for RILIM with IOS.

Resistor Tolerance Accounting 
The analysis above is dedicated for the device 
performance alone on the basis of an exact resistor of 
RILIM. However, resistors are manufactured in a large 
amount of quantity that falls in the range of the upper 
limit and the lower limit around the marked nominal 
value. 
Hence, 
the 
resistance 
variation 
deeply 
influences the current limit threshold in a system scale. 
Table 2 shows how the 1% resistor variation affects the 
actual value of the current limit threshold. When higher 
precision for the current limit threshold is required, 
select a 0.5% or even 0.1% resistor for RILIM instead.

Auto-Retry Function 
In some applications, the device is temporarily closed 
in face of an over-current condition but restarts after a 
programmable delay time. This auto-retry function is 
realized by an external resistor and capacitor. Once a 
fault event occurs, the nFAULT pin turns high and then 
pulls low the EN pin (SGM25006A). The auto-retry 
delay time is set by the RC time constant of the external 
resistor and capacitor mentioned above. The device 
keeps this cycle unless the fault event is cleared. 
Equation 6 gives the formula of the auto-retry delay 
time. 
 
tBR = -RnFAULT × CRETRY × LN (1 - VEN/(VIN - VOL)) + tnFAULT   (6) 
 
where: 
VEN is the EN pin typical threshold voltage. 
VIN is the input voltage. 
VOL is the nFAULT pin typical saturation voltage.  
tnFAULT is the internal nFAULT typical deglitch time. 
Equation 7 presents the formula of the retry duty cycle 
and hence the average current is equal to the product 
of the retry duty cycle and IOS. 
 
D = tnFAULT/(tnFAULT + tBR)           (7)

APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued) 
In some applications, the auto-retry function is needed 
and at the same time the EN pin is controlled with an 
outside signal. As shown in Figure 9, an external 
control signal drives EN through RnFAULT and retains the 
auto-retry ability. The auto-retry time-out period is set 
by the RC time constant of the external resistor and 
capacitor (RnFAULT and CRETRY).

Figure 10. Two-Level Current Limit Circuit 
 
In some applications, different current limit thresholds 
should be revised according to the outside conditions. 
In Figure 10, the SGM25006 is controlled externally 
with a two-level current limit circuit. The resistance 
between ILIM pin and GND pins determines the current 
limit. A MOSFET Q1 is adopted here to change the 
resistance between ILIM pin and GND pins. For more 
current limit thresholds, take more combinations of 
MOSFETs and resistors to change the resistance 
between ILIM pin and GND pin. 
NOTE: no external signal is permitted to be directly applied to 
ILIM pin.
Application Curve 
As shown in Figure 11, the ILOAD is set at 5A, 
programmed by the RILIM (22.1kΩ). The ILOAD steps from 
about 4.9A to 5.2A. The internal nFAULT timer runs, 
and after 11ms, the nFAULT becomes low and the 
current continues to be regulated at about 5A. Due to 
the high power consumption inside the device, thermal 
cycling occurs.

about 560mA to 620mA. The internal nFAULT timer 
runs, and after 11ms, the nFAULT becomes low and the

Power Supply Recommendations 
The input range of SGM25006 is from 2.5V to 6.5V. It is 
recommended to use a 3.3V or 5V power supply with 
10% tolerance. Keep in mind that the maximum current 
that the power supply can provide must be higher than 
IOS. 
 
Layout Guidelines 
 It is recommended to place a 100nF capacitor as 
close to the IN pin as possible with low-inductance 
trace. 
 It is recommended to place a large electrolytic 
capacitor and a 100nF MLCC capacitor between the 
output and GND if high inrush current is considered 
on the output. 
 In order to reduce the parasitic parameters and 
increase the accuracy of user-defined current limit 
threshold, route RILIM as close to the device as 
possible. 
 The thermal pad of SGM25006 should be 
connected to the PCB ground plane with wide and 
short copper traces.
