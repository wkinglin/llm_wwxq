GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM6605 is a constant frequency, current mode, 
synchronous Boost switching regulator. The input 
voltage can accept the voltage at a range from 2.7V to 
5.5V. And the output voltage is adjustable with a peak 
of 5.2V. This device also has the 5.0V fixed output 
version. 
High switching frequency minimizes the sizes of 
inductor and capacitor. Integrated power MOSFETs 
and internal compensation make the SGM6605 simple 
to use and fit the total solution into a compact space. 
The SGM6605 enters the power-save mode at light 
loads to maintain high efficiency. Anti-ringing control 
circuitry reduces EMI concerns by damping the inductor 
in discontinuous mode. The SGM6605 provides true 
output disconnection, allowing VOUT to go to 0V during 
shutdown without drawing any current from the input 
source. The SGM6605 supports 1.8V logic for control. 
The output 
voltage of SGM6605-ADJ can be 
programmed by an external resistor divider, and that of 
SGM6605-5.0 is fixed internally on the chip. The device 
is available in a Green SOT-23-6 package. It operates 
over an ambient temperature range of -40℃ to +85℃.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended

ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
Design 
The SGM6605 is a synchronous Boost converter 
capable of starting up from 2.7V input, which is suitable 
for majority of readily available input sources. The 
device is capable of providing up to 5.2V output, and 
the integrated power MOSFET has 1.1A (TYP) switch 
current limit. 
 
Output Voltage Configuration 
The SGM6605 supports output voltage up to 5.2V, and 
a resistor divider connected at FB pin is used to 
configure the output voltage. The resistive divider value 
is calculated via Equation 1.

               (1) 
For simplicity, 100kΩ is recommended for R2. A 900kΩ 
resistor for R1 configures the output voltage to 5V. 
 
Inductor Selection 
Inductor is an essential element for today’s DC/DC 
switch mode power supplies regardless of topology. 
Inductor serves as the energy storage element for 
power conversion. Inductance and inductor’s saturation 
current are two most important criterions for inductor 
selection. For general rule of thumb, the selected 
inductance should provide a peak to peak ripple current 
that is around 30% of the average inductor current at 
full load and nominal input voltage. The average 
inductor current for a Boost converter is the input 
current. Equation 2 shows the calculation of inductance 
selection, where f is the switching frequency, ΔIL is the 
inductor ripple current.

          (2) 
The selected inductor should have a saturation current 
rating higher than the 1.1A current limit of SGM6605. 
Lastly, the inductor affects the close loop response of 
the DC/DC converter. The SGM6605 is an internally 
compensated device with the loop response optimized 
for inductor in the range of 2.2µH to 10µH. 
 
Input Capacitor 
Boost converter’s input capacitor sees continuous 
current throughout the entire switching cycle. A 10µF 
ceramic capacitor is recommended to place as close as 
possible between the VCC pin and GND pin of 
SGM6605. For the applications where the SGM6605 is 
located far away from the input source, a 47µF or 
higher capacitance capacitor is recommended to damp 
the wiring harness’s inductance.  
 
Output Capacitor 
The output capacitors of Boost converter dictate the 
output voltage ripple and load transient response. 
Equation 3 is used to estimate the necessary 
capacitance to achieve desired output voltage ripple. 
Where ΔV is the maximum allowed ripple.

           (3) 
Again, the SGM6605 is an internally compensated 
device. The loop response is optimized for capacitor in 
the range of 4.7µF to 22µF. Due to the DC bias nature 
of ceramic capacitors, care should be taken by verifying 
manufacture’s datasheet to ensure enough effective 
capacitance at desired output voltage. 
 
Layout Guidelines 
In addition to component selection, layout is a critical 
step to ensure the performance of any switch mode 
power supplies. Poor layout could result in system 
instability, EMI failure, and device damage. Thus, place 
the inductor, input and output capacitors as close to the 
IC as possible, and use wide and short traces for 
current carrying traces to minimize PCB inductance. 
For Boost converter, the output capacitor’s current loop 
from VOUT pin back to the GND pin of the device 
should be as small as possible.
