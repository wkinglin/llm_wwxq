DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
The AAP6013A is a voltage mode synchronous buck 
PWM converter with programmable dual-output CC/CV 
control. 
 
Initialization 
The AAP6013A creates its own internal supplies for use. 
The POR function continually monitors the input bias 
supply voltage at the VCC pin. The POR function 
initiates soft-start operation after VCC supply voltage 
exceeds its POR rising threshold voltage. 
 
Soft-Start 
The AAP6013A has an internal soft-start circuitry to 
reduce supply inrush current during startup conditions. 
The typical soft-start time is about 3ms. The power-on 
reset function initiates the soft-start process. Once the 
VCC voltage falls below 6V, the device will shut down 
until the voltage exceeds 7V again.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Switch Frequency and Disable 
FS/DIS pin has two functions. A resistor is connected to 
the SGND pin to set the internal oscillator frequency for 
the switching regulator. In addition, if this pin is pulled 
down towards SGND with low impedance, it will disable 
the DC/DC regulator until it released (at which time a 
new soft-start cycle will begin). If the FS/DIS pin is 
floating, the device is also shutdown.

CC/CV Control and Output Short Protection 
When the load current is less than the current limit, the 
AAP6013A will regulate the output voltage and operate 
in the constant-voltage (CV) control mode. If the load 
current increases and reaches the current-limit point 
sensed by the CS1 or CS2 pin, then the AAP6013A will 
enter the constant-current (CC) control mode, and the 
output voltage will decrease. If the FB pin voltage is 
lower than 465mV, the device will stop switching for a 
long time before initiating a new soft-start cycle. If the 
output over-current condition or output short condition 
is not removed, the converter will enter hiccup mode. 
By this long time sleeping at over-current condition or 
output under-voltage condition, the input current of the 
system is nearly zero. 
If the output voltage is shorted directly to ground, a 
low-side switch current-limit function will take over. It is 
realized by sensing the current through the low-side 
switch after a blanking time (200ns TYP) when low-side 
switch turns on. If the current is larger than 17A, the 
high-side MOSFET will skip turning on for at least 3 
cycles and the low-side switch will remain on until the 
current is less than 17A. 
OVP and Thermal Shutdown 
If the FB pin voltage is higher than 1.1 × VREF, the 
AAP6013A will immediately stop switching, and the 
device will not open the high-side MOSFET until the 
output voltage decreases to regulation target. 
Over temperature protection limits total power dissipation 
in the device. When the junction temperature exceeds 
+150 ℃, a thermal sensor forces the device into 
shutdown, allowing the die to cool. The thermal sensor 
turns the device on again after the junction temperature 
cools by 15℃. 
 
BST Capacitor, Bootstrap Refresh 
A capacitor from the SW pin to the BST pin is required 
for the bootstrap circuit for the high-side gate driver. 
The voltage of the SW pin can go as high as the supply 
voltage during the high-side MOSFET opens. A diode 
is included on the IC (anode to internal 5V VCC, 
cathode to BST pin), such that the VCC will be the 
bootstrap supply. At no load or very light load condition, 
high-side and low-side MOSFETs are both off for a long 
time. There is no charging path to the bootstrap 
capacitor because the switch node voltage is equal to 
VOUT (5V, TYP). The bootstrap capacitor loses energy 
and its voltage will go down. The AAP6013A has a 
charge mode which can let the system work properly at 
very light load condition: if the device stops switching 
for 32 cycles after zero cross current detection, it will 
force low-side MOSFET to turn on for 250ns, and then 
switch node voltage will go down to the ground so that 
bootstrap capacitor can be charged again. 
Pre-biased Startup 
The device is designed for safe monotonic startup into 
pre-biased loads.

external resistor divider from the output node to the FB 
pin as shown in Figure 3.

Inductor Selection 
The required external components for the step-down 
are an inductor, input and output filter capacitors, and 
compensation RC network. The AAP6013A provides 
best efficiency with continuous inductor current. A 
reasonable inductor value (LIDEAL) can be derived from 
the following:

=
×
×
IN
IDEAL

OUT

D (1-D)
L

I
K
             (4)
 
where KRIPPLE is the ratio of the peak-to-peak inductor 
current to the inductor DC current. Usually, we set 
KRIPPLE between 10% ~ 30%. D is the duty cycle: 
=
OUT
IN
V
D
V
                      (5)
 
Given LIDEAL, the peak-to-peak inductor current is 
KRIPPLE × IOUT. The absolute-peak inductor current is 
IOUT × (1 + 0.5KRIPPLE). Inductance values smaller than 
LIDEAL can be used to reduce inductor size; however, if 
much smaller values are used, inductor current rises, 
and larger output capacitance may be required to 
suppress output ripple. Larger values than LIDEAL can 
be used to obtain higher output current, but typically 
with larger inductor size. 
 
Output Capacitor Selection 
The output capacitor is determined by the required 
ESR to minimize voltage ripple. Moreover, the amount 
of bulk capacitance is also a key for COUT selection to 
ensure that the control loop is stable. The 220μF 
polymer output capacitors are suggested to be used in 
most applications. Loop stability can be checked by 
viewing the load transient response. 
The output ripple is given by: 
∆

         (6) 
The output ripple will be the highest at maximum input 
voltage since ΔIL increases with input voltage. Multiple 
capacitors placed in parallel may be needed to meet 
the ESR and RMS current handling requirement.

APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued) 
Input Capacitor Selection 
The input capacitor needs to be carefully selected to 
maintain sufficiently low ripple at the supply input of the 
converter. A low ESR capacitor is highly recommended. 
Since large current flows in and out of this capacitor 
during normal switching, its ESR also affects efficiency. 
Use small ceramic capacitors (CHF) for high frequency 
decoupling and bulk capacitors to supply the surge 
current needed each time high-side MOSFET turns on. 
Place the small ceramic capacitors physically close to 
the PVIN and PGND pins. 
The input buck capacitors should also be placed close 
to the PVIN pins with the shortest layout traces to the 
ground connections. The important parameters for the 
buck input capacitors are the voltage rating and the 
RMS current rating. For reliable operation, select the 
bulk capacitor with voltage and current ratings above 
the maximum input voltage and largest RMS current 
required by the circuit. The capacitor voltage rating 
should be at least 1.25 times greater than the maximum 
input voltage and a voltage rating of 1.5 times is a 
conservative guideline. 
The RMS current is given by:

IRMS has a maximum at VIN = 2VOUT, where IRMS = IOUT/2. 
This simple worst-case condition is commonly used for 
design because even significant deviations do not offer 
much relief. 
 
EMI Consideration 
Since parasitic inductance and capacitance effects in 
PCB circuitry would cause a spike voltage on SW node 
when high-side MOSFET is turned on/off, this spike 
voltage on SW pin may impact on EMI performance in 
the system. In order to enhance EMI performance, 
there are two methods to suppress the spike voltage. 
One is to place an RC snubber between SW and GND 
and make them as close as possible to the high-side 
MOSFET’s source and low-side MOSFET’s drain. 
Another method is to add a resistor in series with the 
bootstrap capacitor C1. But this method will decrease 
the driving capability to the high-side MOSFET. It is 
strongly recommended to reserve the RC snubber 
during PCB layout for EMI improvement. Moreover, 
reducing the SW trace area and keeping the main power 
in a small loop will be helpful on EMI performance.

PCB LAYOUT GUIDE 
When doing the PCB layout, some critical considerations 
should be taken to ensure proper operation and the 
best performance of the AAP6013A. Below are the 
rules of thumb for AAP6013A PCB layout.  
The input power path including the PVIN, SW and the 
PGND traces should be as short as possible, direct and 
wide. So the input capacitors (C2 and C3) are placed as 
close to PVIN pins of the device as possible, thus the 
input loop length/area shaped by C2, C3, PVIN pins and 
PGND pins are the shortest/smallest respectively. 
The output power path between the SW pins of the 
AAP6013A, the power inductor L1 and the output 
capacitors (C4 and C5) should be kept short and wide. 
Keep the switching node SW away from the sensitive pins 
such as FB, COMP, CS1 and CS2 of the AAP6013A. The 
external components of FB, COMP, CS1 and CS2 of 
the device are placed at the opposite side of the power 
inductor L1. 
Keep the snubbed circuit R9 and C11 to the SW pins of 
the AAP6013A as close as possible.  
Keep the SW trace as physically short and wide as 
practical to minimize radiated emissions. 
Use Kelvin sense connection techniques from the 
sensing resistor (R1/R2) pads directly to the CS1/CS2 
and SGND pins to achieve accurate CC limit.
