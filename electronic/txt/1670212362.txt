OCTOBER 2022 – REV. A. 1 
GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM25711B is a hot swap controller that allows a 
board to be safely inserted or removed from a live 
backplane. An internal circuit drives an external 
N-MOSFET switch to control supply voltage from 2.5V 
to 18V. 
The SGM25711B offers programmable current limit, 
power-limiting and fault time to ensure that the external 
MOSFET is always working within its safe operating 
area. If the load current is higher than the set current for 
more than the programmed time, the external MOSFET 
will be shutdown. The SGM25711B restarts automatically 
after a fault timeout delay. The low current sense 
threshold of 25mV is very accurate, which allows the 
use of smaller detection resistors resulting in lower 
power losses and smaller size. 
This feature allows the user to easily design a high 
reliability system. The device has power and fault 
output functions to provide condition monitoring and 
load protection. 
SGM25711B is available in a Green MSOP-10 package.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.

PIN DESCRIPTION 
PIN 
NAME 
FUNCTION 
1 
nPG 
Power Good Indicator Pin (Active-Low, Open-Drain). The voltage of the external MOSFET 
determines its state. 
2 
EN 
Enable Pin. Active-high enable input. Connect to resistor divider. 
3 
PROG 
Power-Limiting Programmable Pin. The power-limiting resistor connected to this pin determines 
the maximum allowable dissipation of the external MOSFET.  
4 
TIMER

delay. The chip's restart time is also controlled by this capacitor.  
5 
GND 
Ground. 
6 
OUT 
Power Output Pin. Connect this pin to output (i.e., external MOSFET source). The chip monitors 
MOSFET VDS voltage through this pin to limit the MOSFET power and control the nPG signal 
accordingly.  
7 
GATE 
Gate Driver Output. This pin is connected to the gate of the external MOSFET.  
8 
SENSE 
Current Sense Pin. The voltage from the input pin to this pin is measured by the current flowing 
into the sense resistor.  
9 
VCC 
Power Input Pin. It is recommended to place a small bypass capacitor close this pin.  
10 
nFLT 
Fault Event Indicator Pin. Go low when the external MOSFET has been turned off by the 
overload fault timer.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
VCC 
There are three functions for the VCC pin. First, power 
the chip. Second, this pin is the input terminal of power 
on reset (POR) and under-voltage lockout (UVLO) 
functions. Third, the lead of the VCC should be directly 
connected to the positive end of the sense resistor, so 
that the current flowing through the resistor can be 
more accurately detected. A 0.1μF capacitor is 
recommended. 
 
EN 
When the voltage of EN pin is greater than 1.35V, the 
gate driver starts to work. An external divide resistor 
can be added to monitor the input under-voltage. When 
the chip is locked, pull down and then up EN to restart 
the chip. Do not float this pin.  
 
GATE 
This pin is the MOSFET (M1) gate drive. The charge 
pump charges the gate with a current of 33µA. Since 
VCC is approximately equal to VOUT during normal 
operation, the V(GATE - VCC) is clamped to a maximum of 
13.5V. During startup, the amplifier regulates the output 
current to control the gate voltage and to limit the inrush 
current. During the surge, the TIMER pin charges the 
capacitor with a current of 10µA until the V(GATE - VCC) 
voltage exceeds the set voltage (5.6V when VCC = 12V), 
if V(GATE - VCC) is greater than the timer set voltage, the 
TIMER pin stops sourcing current and starts sinking 
current. This pin is disabled in three situations: 
1. Under the following circumstances, the 11mA current 
sink will pull down the GATE voltage: 
 V(VCC - SENSE) > 25mV. 
 VEN is lower than the falling threshold voltage. 
 VCC reaches the lower threshold of UVLO. 
 
2. The GATE pin is pulled down through a 3.2Ω resistor 
when VEN is less than its falling threshold or when an 
output short occurs and V(VCC - SENSE) exceeds 61.5mV, 
the chip trips shutdown quickly, and there is still 11mA 
pull-down current to turn off the MOSFET. 
3. If the chip temperature exceeds the threshold, the 
chip discharges the GATE charge to GND through a 
17.5kΩ resistor. In the auto-retry mode, the chip will 
restart periodically. No resistance should be connected 
between the GATE and GND (or OUT) pins. 
 
nFLT 
The nFLT pin is assigned for SGM25711B. When the 
SGM25711B remains within the current limit long 
enough for the fault timer to expire, the low open-drain 
output will be pulled low. The SGM25711B operates in 
auto-retry mode. In the auto-retry mode, the fault 
timeout will stop the operation of the external MOSFET 
(M1) and try to restart after 16 hiccup cycles. When the 
fault is not eliminated, the hiccup continues. At this time, 
this pin will be pulled low. If M1 is disabled by EN, 
OTSD or UVLO, the nFLT pin will not be asserted. The 
pin can remain suspended when not needed. 
 
OUT 
This pin can measure the voltage between drain and 
source of MOSFET. Power-limiting also needs the 
function of this pin. It is recommended to place 
Schottky diode to prevent negative pressure. At the 
same time, this pin needs to connect the low ESR 
ceramic capacitor to the ground to bypass the 
high-frequency signal. 
 
nPG 
When the voltage across drain and source of MOSFET 
is less than 230mV and a deglitch time of 4ms elapses, 
the drain of this pin is pulled down. When VDS > 315mV, 
it becomes open-drain output. That is, when the VDS of 
M1 rises, the pin assumes a high resistance state after 
the same deglitch time.

PROG 
The resistance between PROG and GND pins sets the 
maximum power allowed by MOSFET. Do not apply 
voltage directly to the PROG pin. When the constant 
power-limiting function is not used, connect this pin to 
the ground with a 4.99kΩ resistance. If it is necessary 
to set the constant power, please refer to Equation 1.

TIMER 
A CTIMER capacitor is connected between TIMER and 
GND to time the fault time. When the overload occurs, 
the TIMER charges the CTIMER with 10μA current, 
otherwise discharges the CTIMER with 10μA current. If 
VTIMER reaches 1.35V, the MOSFET will be turned off. 
The capacitor sets the restart time after failure. It is 
recommended to place a minimum capacitance of 1nF 
to ensure the normal operation of the timer. The value

After the time counting, the TIMER pin will be pulled to 
GND by the 7mA sinking current, and then the 
MOSFET will be restarted. In any of the following cases, 
the CTIMER charge will also be put to GND by the 7mA 
current source:

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Device Functional Modes 
SGM25711B has all the functions of the forward hot 
plug 
controller, 
mainly 
including: 
start 
surge 
suppression, under-voltage lockout, external MOSFET 
driving and power-limiting, overload timeout shutdown 
and indication functions. 
Figure 6 to Figure 8 and Figure 10 to Figure 12 
respectively show the typical application (12V/10A) and 
oscilloscope plots. Many of the previously described 
capabilities are shown in these figures. 
 
Board Plug-In 
Figure 6 and Figure 7 show the surge current of 
SGM25711B during hot plug. When VCC > 1.5V, power 
on reset (POR) initializes and the chip is ready to start. 
If the internal voltage is higher than the EN threshold, 
GATE, PROG, TIMER, nPG, nFLT begin to release. 
The chip starts to drive the MOSFET (M1) through the 
GATE pin. At the same time, monitor the current and 
voltage at both ends (DS) of M1 to limit the current and 
power. The current increases with the decrease of VDS 
until the current limit value is reached.

Inrush Operation 
After the enable of SGM25711B is activated, the GATE 
pin starts to flow current and the VGATE rises. When it 
reaches the opening threshold of M1, M1 has current 
flowing into the output capacitor. When the current is 
higher than the limit value, the negative feedback 
system will adjust the turn-on degree of the MOSFET to 
keep the current at the limit value. Constant power 
process is a more complex process. When the constant 
power occurs, the TIMER pin starts charging the CTIMER 
with a current of 10μA until V(GATE - VCC) = 5.6V. Then 
discharge CTIMER with 10μA. When V(GATE - VCC) < 5.6V, 
VTIMER exceeds the upper limit value of 1.35V, the 
GATE is pulled down, and the chip enters the auto-retry 
process. 
When the surge ends, the power-limiting function will 
be disabled. When the load current is higher than the 
limit value, the chip will turn off the MOSFET after the 
timing period.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
The Action of a Constant Power Engine 
Figure 7 shows the operation of constant power 
function. After the PROG is connected to a resistor, it is 
used to program the power-limiting of 54W. At this time, 
the current starts to flow through the MOSFET. When 
the VDS of MOSFET is 12V, the maximum allowable 
current is 4.5A (54W divided by 12V). As the VDS 
voltage decreases, the current will gradually increase. 
Figure 7 shows the measured power of MOSFET. The 
power remains essentially constant during operation 
until the current limit is reached. The constant power 
function allows the MOSFET to work close to its SOA 
area, thereby reducing the constant power time and the 
size of the MOSFET.

Circuit-Breaker and Fast-Trip 
By 
monitoring 
the 
voltage 
across 
RSENSE, 
the 
SGM25711B measures load current. The SGM25711B 
offers two limit thresholds: a current limit threshold and 
a fast-trip shutdown threshold. 
The circuit-breaker mode and fast-trip turn-off are 
shown in Figure 8 through Figure 11. 
 
 
Figure 8 shows the performance of the chip when the 
load current is higher than the current limit but below 
the fast-trip shutdown threshold. When this happens, 
the controller adjusts the gate voltage to adjust the 
current flowing through RSENSE to the set current. At the 
same time, the CTIMER is charged with a 10μA current 
source. When the VTIMER reaches the upper limit of 
1.35V, the MOSFET is turned off, and the chip is 
restarted cyclically. At the same time, the nFLT pin is 
pulled down to indicate a fault. 
Figure 10 and Figure 11 show the behavior when a fast- 
trip shutdown occurs. The function of fast-trip shutdown 
is to prevent the system from being cut off quickly in 
case of serious failure. When the RSENSE voltage 
exceeds the fast-trip shutdown threshold, the gate 
charge is immediately pulled down to GND by the large 
current source, and the resistance is about 3.2Ω at this 
time. The turn-off current can be changed by a low 
value resistance connected in series between GATE 
pin and gate of the MOSFET. After a few milliseconds 
of fast-trip, the gate voltage rises again and the circuit 
restarts.

Auto-Retry 
SGM25711B will turn off the MOSFET and restart 
automatically when a fault occurs. Restart the MOSFET 
after 16 timing cycles, as shown in Figure 12. When the 
fault still exists, the timing and restart will continue. At 
this time, the charging and discharging currents are the 
same. In the first cycle, the TIMER voltage rises from 
0V to 1.35V and then drops to 0.35V. For the next 16 
counting cycles, 0.35V is used as low threshold cycle. 
This will reduce the thermal stress caused to MOSFET 
restarting.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
nPG, nFLT and TIMER Operations 
The nPG adds the deglitched design inside, which 
changes to active-low after COUT is fully charged for 
4ms, providing sufficient margin for various unstable 
situations at power-up. 
Make sure that the chosen MOSFET on-resistance is 
as small as possible, and in order for the system to 
operate in a safe temperature or electrical environment, 
the nPG will change to a high-impedance state when 
the on-voltage drop of the MOSFET is greater than 
315mV to send a warning to the downstream device. 
When the over-current condition occurs, an internal 
10μA current source charges the CTIMER and starts fault 
timing, and when the voltage of the CTIMER reaches 
1.35V, the nFLT pin is pulled low, otherwise the high- 
impedance state continues. 
The fault timer starts counting at any of the following 
moments: 
1. During start-up, if V(GATE - VCC) rises to the voltage of 
timer activation before VTIMER reaches 1.35V, the device 
assumes that the MOSFET can start normally, the fault 
timer will shut down. If the V(GATE - VCC) is less than the 
voltage of timer activation within the fault time set by 
the CTIMER, the MOSFET will be shut down and enter an 
auto-retry. 
2. When the over-current condition occurs, the CTIMER is 
charged from 0V to 1.35V starting with the GATE pin 
which is pulled low. After fault timer period, the TIMER 
will enter the auto-retry mode. 
3. After an output short-circuit causes an over-current, 
the MOSFET is quickly shut down. The CTIMER is 
charged from 0V to 1.35V starting the GATE pin which 
is pulled low. After fault timer period, the TIMER will 
enter the auto-retry mode. 
If the load returns below the programmed current limit 
value during the restart period, the MOSFET turns on 
after the VTIMER drops to 0V. 
During the restart period, CTIMER's 16th discharge until 
VTIMER is pulled down to 0V, after the GATE pin briefly 
opens for the first half-cycle of the charge. This cyclical 
process continues until the failure is recovered or the 
device is disabled by EN or UVLO. 
 
Over-Temperature Shutdown (OTSD) 
Over-temperature protection circuitry has also been 
added inside the device, and when the temperature 
exceeds +145℃, the MOSFET will be turned off and 
the nFLT, nPG pins will enter into high-impedance state. 
The recovered temperature hysteresis is 15℃. 
 
Startup of Hot Swap Circuit by VCC or EN 
When EN or UVLO reaches the upper threshold, the 
device charges the GATE pin, and after the inrush 
process, M1 is fully turned on. 
M1 will be shut down when EN under-voltage, load 
over-current, short-circuit, or over-temperature occurs. 
1. If the following happens, the GATE is pulled low by 
an 11mA current source.  
 
The fault timer expires during an overload current 
fault (V(VCC - SENSE) > 25mV).  
 
The value of VEN is less than the falling threshold 
voltage. 
 
The value of VCC is lower than the UVLO 
threshold. 
2. When the output hard short occurs and the V(VCC - 
SENSE) is higher than the fast-trip shutdown threshold 
(61.5mV), the GATE is pulled down through an 
N-MOSFET (3.2Ω when VDS = 0.2V) by 13.5μs. After 
the fast-trip shutdown is complete, a continuous current 
of 11mA ensures that the external MOSFET remains 
shutdown. 
3. If the die temperature is higher than the OTSD rising 
threshold, GATE pin is discharged to GND by a 17.5kΩ 
resistor.

Choose M1 
The SGM25711B is designed for MOSFET with a 
gate-source voltage rating of 20V. 
Lower gate-source voltage MOSFET can be used with 
an external Zener diode to keep the peak value of 
gate-source voltage in absolute ratings. 
Another factor must be considered is drain-to-source 
voltage. So it is recommended that add an external 
TVS to the input end. Extreme conditions of abrupt 
shutoff or short-circuit will cause the surge in input 
voltage. Besides, please use MOSFET with the VDS(MAX) 
rating at least twice as the power supply value. 
Voltage across the MOSFET should less than minimum 
nPG threshold of 235mV. A maximum on-resistance of 
19mΩ is required under the condition of 12A current 
limit. Besides, please refer to Equation 7 to calculate 
the maximum on-resistance at the corresponding 
ambient temperature.

Considering all these factors, choose CSD16403Q5 as

maximum RDSON of 2.8mΩ at room temperature. The 
device can hold up to 10A current flowing through 
during normal operation. The power dissipation of the 
MOSFET is about 0.24W and a 9.6℃ rise in junction 
temperature.  
Power dissipation of the MOSFET must be kept in SOA 
as the power consumption during a fault is much larger 
than it in steady-state. 
 
 Choose PLIM and RPROG 
The M1 consumes large power during start-up. Please 
avoid the device rising temperature to an absolute 
maximum value (TJ(MAX)2) for a short period of time. 
Assuming the value is 130℃, refer to the Equation 8 to 
calculate the minimum PLIM.

APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued) 
The tON calculated in Equation 10 only takes the voltage 
rise in OUT capacitor into consideration. Besides, when 
consider the time margin set by the timing capacitor, 
add up the time which takes to charge the GATE pin 
voltage to 5.6V above the input voltage. Please refer to 
the Equation 11.

It should learn about the IGATE is 20μA and CISS is 
2040pF through respective electrical characteristic. By 
using the example parameters, it is easy to get that the 
CSD16403Q5 takes 1.3ms as the fault time. Please 
also kindly refer to the SOA curves of MOSFET for 
circuit safety. The fault timer should be set higher than 
1.3ms to avoid power loss during startup and below the 
corresponding time of the SOA curve at the specified 
operating temperature. 
Factors such as temperature, component tolerance and 
load characteristics, choose 7ms as the fault time to 
reserve sufficient margin. Choose the second highest 
capacitor specification is 52nF and the final failure time 
is 7.56ms.

Calculate the Auto-Retry Mode Duty Ratio 
Learn about the device will be charged and discharged 
16 times as Figure 12. Note that the timer capacitor will 
charge from 0V to 1.35V and discharge from 1.35V to 
0.35V. So, the total time is 7.56ms + 33 × 5.6ms = 
192.36ms. The auto-retry mode duty cycle is 
7.56ms/192.36ms = 3.93%. 
 
Select the R1 and R2 for Under-Voltage 
Next, select the value of the divider resistance of the 
UVLO pin as Figure 1 according to the VENTH value of 
1.35V in electrical specifications.

If R1 is 130kΩ, the value of R2 can be calculated as 
18.7kΩ. 
 
Select R4, R5, RGATE and C1 
Choose the appropriate gate resistor based on the 
actual input capacitance value of MOSFET, and if the 
CISS of the MOSFET is less than 200pF, a gate 
resistance of 33Ω is recommended. In addition, if 
required, assign 3.3kΩ pull-up resistors to the nFLT and 
nPG pins, as they are open-drain outputs. C1 is a 
bypass capacitor and ceramic capacitors which are 
smaller than 100nF are recommended. 
 
Use of nPG 
To avoid undesired latch-up of the downstream DC/DC 
converter, please use nPG to control the enable pin of 
the DC/DC converter instead of connect the COUT of the 
hot swap controller to the VIN pin of the downstream 
device directly. It also can use a long time delay to 
make sure the fully charge of the COUT. 
 
Output Clamp Diode 
To avoid inverting condition of the OUT pin caused by 
inductive loads transients or current limit, please 
connect a Schottky diode to the OUT end. 
 
Gate Clamp Diode 
To keep the VGS of M1 in absolute rating, connect an 
external clamp Zener to the gate and source of the M1 if 
it is needed. Please also connect a series resistance or 
a silicon diode to cut off the output capacitance 
discharging path through GATE pin. 
 
High Gate Capacitance Applications 
Once the gate capacitance (total) of the MOSFET is 
larger than 4000pF, use an external Zener diode to gate 
voltage overstress or fault current spikes. 
 
Bypass Capacitors 
To avoid large inrush current during plug-in period, 
please use suitable low-impedance ceramic capacitor 
(10nF to 0.1μF is recommended).
