GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM6029 family is a low voltage, efficient and 
miniature synchronous Buck converter with ultra-low 
quiescent 
current. 
Operating 
at 
high 
switching 
frequency (4.0MHz, TYP), miniature inductors and 
capacitors can be used to achieve minimal solution size. 
The rated load current is from 0.6A to 1A depending on 
the input voltage and operating frequency. For high 
light-load efficiency, the operating mode can smoothly 
and automatically change between power-save mode 
and PWM. 
The dual-role VSEL/MODE pin sets the output voltage 
to one of the 16 preset values by sensing an external 
resistor during startup using an integrated resistor to 
digital (R2D) converter. After startup, this pin acts as 
MODE input and applying a logic high on it will force the 
device in the pulse width modulation (PWM) mode. This 
will allow using the same part for a wide range of 
voltage rails in different applications and offer a better 
output accuracy compared to the conventional external 
feedback resistor divider. In the forced-PWM (FPWM), 
the device switches at 4.0MHz (A, B and C versions) or 
1.5MHz (D and E versions). High switching frequency 
reduces the output ripple, but at lighter loads, sacrifices 
the efficiency a little bit. 
The SGM6029 is available in a Green WLCSP- 
0.74×1.09-6B package.

C1 
VSEL/MODE 
I 
Connect an accurate resistor between this pin and GND to select one of the 16 preset output voltage 
values. An R2D converter is only enabled during startup to read this resistor. After startup, this pin 
acts as MODE input. A logic high sets the device in the FPWM mode and a logic low selects the 
power-save mode operation. 
C2 
EN 
I 
Active High Enable Input. Apply a logic high voltage to enable the device or a logic low to disable it. 
During the initial phase of startup, an internal 570kΩ pull-down resistor is temporarily connected to 
the EN input. The pull-down resistor is removed after all internal circuits are powered up and 
functional. 
NOTE: I = input, O = output, P = power, G = ground.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
Overview 
The SGM6029 family is a low quiescent current and 
high frequency synchronous Buck converter. It offers 
high efficiency over a wide load range including very 
low output currents in the power-save mode. It can be 
set to forced-PWM mode or automatic power-save 
mode/PWM mode. It features seamless and automatic 
transitions between power-save mode and PWM mode 
based on the inductor current continuity (CCM or DCM). 
The controllers have combined benefits of the 
hysteretic and voltage mode control and provide very 
low output ripple, outstanding DC and AC regulation 
and excellent transient response. Other than the 
accurate DC voltage feedback loop, the AC deviations 
of the output are also sensed by the VOS pin and are 
fed back to a second loop that controls the ramp signal 
of the comparator in the modulator stage. This 
arrangement provides fixed operation frequency in 
steady state but quickly changes the frequency upon a 
dynamic load change for instant response. The 
controller is internally compensated and is stable with 
low ESR output ceramic capacitors. These converters 
are perfect for the applications that require high 
efficiency at very light loads like small battery operated 
systems. 
VIN Under-Voltage Lockout Protection 
(UVLO) 
To avoid device malfunctioning when the VIN voltage is 
insufficient and for proper powering of the whole 
internal circuit, the input supply is constantly monitored 
to make sure it is above the under-voltage lockout 
(UVLO) threshold. When the device re-enters operation 
from UVLO status (VIN rising), it will act like being 
enabled. Every time the device is disabled and enabled, 
a startup sequence with VSEL R2D converter will 
occur. 
Enable Control and Shutdown Mode (EN 
Pin) 
A logic low on the EN input will disable (shut down) the 
device and a high logic turns it on. To avoid problems 
caused by insufficient EN pull-down or floating during 
startup, such as weak pull-down at low voltage startup 
conditions, an internal 570kΩ resistor pulls this pin to 
GND during startup. This pull-down resistor is removed 
when the internal circuit and the reference have been 
powered up and stabilized. If the EN pin goes low, the 
SGM6029 is disabled and the internal pull-down 
resistor will connect. 
Internal Soft-Start 
If VIN voltage is in the operating range, when the EN is 
pulled high, the device is powered up and initialized 
within the startup delay time (tSTARTUP_DELAY). Then the 
converter starts to switch and the output voltage ramps 
up during the soft-start time (tSS) as shown in Figure 3. 
The tSTARTUP_DELAY duration depends on the selected 
output voltage (VSEL). It is the shortest when VSEL = 0 
and the longest when VSEL = 16.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
The VSEL/MODE Pin 
VSEL/MODE is a dual-role pin. During startup, this pin 
acts as VSEL input and senses the connected resistor 
value for output voltage selection. After startup, it 
functions as MODE selection input to set the device 
operating 
mode 
in 
the 
forced-PWM 
(high) 
or 
power-save mode (low). See the Device Comparison 
Table and the VSEL resistor values (Table 1) for details. 
Resistor to Digital (R2D) Converter and Selection of 
the Output Voltage 
An external resistor (RVSEL) placed between the 
VSEL/MODE pin and GND determines the output 
voltage. After enabling the device and when the internal 
reference is stable, the resistor to digital (R2D) 
converter starts sensing the RVSEL before the 
tSTARTUP_DELAY ends. A current is injected in the RVSEL 
and an ADC reads the resulting voltage. Based on the 
sensed voltage, one of the preset internal feedback 
resistor dividers is chosen to set the output voltage. 
After completing R2D conversion, current injection is 
stopped and no current flows out of the VSEL/MODE 
pin. The output voltage is selected and fixed once and 
during startup only. Make sure there is no other 
external current leakage or capacitance (>30pF) 
present on this pin during VSEL detection or UVLO 
events to avoid wrong VOUT setting. Use the E96 
resistor values with maximum 1% tolerance and good 
thermal stability (TC < 200ppm/℃) to set the output 
voltage as suggested in Table 1. Note that the RVSEL 
does not affect the output accuracy. 
Shorting VSEL to GND sets the default output voltage 
(SGM6029A/SGM6029D 
= 
0.7V, 
SGM6029B/ 
SGM6029E = 1.2V, SGM6029C = 1.8V) and saves 
more space by reducing one external resistor. 
Power-Save Mode and Forced-PWM (FPWM) 
Operation Mode Selection 
After the power-up period, the VSEL/MODE pin acts as 
mode select input. A logic low applied to this input 
selects the power-save mode and a logic high selects 
FPWM operation. Changing the mode during operation 
(after completing VSEL function) is allowed. 
Output Voltage Discharge 
To ensure that the output voltage drops to 0V in a 
controlled manner and remains close to 0V while the 
device is disabled, a resistor (4Ω, TYP) is connected 
between the converter output and GND through the 
VOS pin as soon as the device is disabled. The output 
voltage discharge feature is present only after enabling 
the device for the first time after the input supply is 
applied. It is not active if the device is disabled and then 
power supply is applied. To keep this feature active, the 
supply voltage must remain above the UVLO falling 
threshold (VIN > VTH_UVLO-). 
Power-Save Mode Operation 
The SGM6029 controller has power-save mode 
operation capability. With power-save mode, the 
modulator can enter the pulse frequency modulation 
(PFM) rather than the fixed-frequency PWM switching 
at light loads. One switching pulse is applied to the LC 
filter to charge the output capacitor and keep the output 
regulated and then the device enters a long sleep 
period while the output capacitor supplies the small 
load current. During the sleep period between 
successive pulses, almost all internal circuits of the 
SGM6029 are turned off to minimize the quiescent 
current. The length of the sleep period is longer when 
the load is lighter. A higher inductor peak-current 
setting can also extend the off-time duration. For the 
SGM6029, the quiescent current can be reduced to the 
ultra-low levels in the order of 2.3μA (TYP). Such low 
quiescent current levels are achieved by integrating 
high impedance feedback divider inside the device, 
using a very low power voltage reference and improved 
power-save mode operation. The switching frequency 
is almost proportional to the load current in PFM mode. 
When the load is increased, the inductor current 
becomes continuous (CCM mode) and the device 
automatically enters the fixed-frequency PWM.  
The nominal PWM switching frequency for SGM6029A/ 
SGM6029B/SGM6029C is fSW = 4.0MHz and for 
SGM6029D/SGM6029E is fSW = 1.5MHz. However, the 
exact frequency depends on VIN and VOUT. The change 
between PFM and PWM occurs when the inductor 
current becomes marginally discontinued (valley 
current reaches zero). Using a unified controller to 
manage PFM and PWM operations, this device can 
seamlessly change mode with minimum output voltage 
ripple due to the mode change.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Forced-PWM Mode (FPWM) Operation 
If the FPWM mode is selected (MODE = high), the 
device runs at the fixed-frequency PWM in the entire 
load range. The FPWM mode reduces the light load 
efficiency due to the circulating currents, but the high 
frequency interference is significantly reduced due to 
the wider soft switching range of the converter at light 
loads and the relatively fixed-frequency spectrum of the 
noise. 
100% Duty Cycle Operation Mode 
When the voltage of the input source, such as battery, 
falls and its value is close to the output voltage, the 
PWM duty cycle (D = VOUT/VIN) increases to near 100%. 
Eventually the high-side switch remains continuously 
on to keep the output regulated. Even when the input 
voltage falls below the output, the high-side switch is 
turned on to minimize the error. 
Short Circuit and Switch Current Limit 
Protections 
To prevent damage to the SGM6029 or load when an 
output short circuit or over-current occurs, the high-side 
and low-side MOSFET switch currents are monitored 
and limited in a cycle-by-cycle basis. If the high-side 
switch current exceeds its limit, it will be turned off and 
the low-side switch will be turned on to decrease the 
inductor current until it falls below the low-side current 
limit. At this time the low-side switch will be turned off 
and the high-side switch will be turned on again. 
Thermal Shutdown Protection 
To protect the device from overheating damage, 
thermal protection is included in the device. If the 
junction 
temperature 
(TJ) 
exceeds 
the 
thermal 
shutdown threshold (TSD = 160℃, TYP), both switches 
will be turned off. When the die cools down and TJ falls 
below hysteresis window (20℃, TYP), the switching 
resumes automatically after a soft-start. There is no 
R2D conversion after thermal shutdown and VOUT sets 
to the previous value. Also please note that there is no 
thermal protection in the power-save mode.

Design Procedure 
1. The VIN, VOUT and IOUT requirements must be known 
to start the design. 
2. For each application, the design can be optimized for 
efficiency, solution size or other factors. 
3. Compare your design with solutions provided by 
SGMICRO. 
Inductor Selection 
The inductance of the output filter (L) determines the 
peak-to-peak ripple current and indirectly affects the 
converter efficiency and output voltage ripple. It also 
determines the current at which the PWM-to-PFM 
transition occurs (CCM to DCM). The ripple current (ΔIL) 
can be estimated from Equation 1. It shows that ΔIL 
decreases with larger inductance values and increases 
at higher voltage levels (VIN or VOUT).

Where, f is switching frequency, L is inductance value, 
ΔIL is the inductor peak-to-peak ripple current and IL_MAX 
is the peak inductor current. The maximum current 
should never reach the inductor saturation level. This 
situation can happen after a large load step. A common 
conservative option is to choose an inductor with a 
saturation current equal to or higher than the high-side 
switch current limit (ILIMF).  
Some of the inductor part numbers that satisfy these 
conditions are listed in Table 3.

Input Capacitor (CIN) 
A low ESR ceramic capacitor must be connected close to the VIN and GND pins to provide the pulsating input 
current of the converter and minimize switching noise and ringings. A 4.7μF ceramic capacitor is satisfactory for 
most applications, however, if a high impedance source such as a coin cell-battery is used, larger input capacitance 
(CIN ≥ 10μF) is preferred to prevent voltage drops during startup or load steps. There is no high limit for the input 
capacitance, however, note that the higher leakage current of a large input capacitor will increase the total quiescent 
current of the power supply. 
Some applicable input capacitors are listed in Table 4.

Output Capacitor (COUT) 
Table 5 can be used to select the proper LC filter 
components for most design requirements. The 
inductor initial tolerance can be as high as -30% to +20% 
of the nominal value and proper current derating is 
usually required. Bias voltage can cause significant 
capacitance drops in the ceramic capacitors. The 
effective deviation of a ceramic capacitor can be as 
high as -50% to +20% of the nominal value. 
L1 = 0.47µH or 1µH and COUT = 10µF are the 
recommended values for the typical application of 
SGM6029A/SGM6029B/SGM6029C. L1 = 1µH and 
COUT = 10µF are the recommended values for the 
typical application of SGM6029D/SGM6029E.

Layout Guidelines 
A good printed-circuit-board (PCB) layout is a critical element of any high performance design. Follow the guidelines 
below for designing a good layout for the SGM6029. 
• Place the input capacitor close to the device with the shortest possible connection traces.  
• Share the same GND return point for the input and output capacitors and locate it as close as possible to the 
device GND pin to minimize the AC current loops. Place the inductor close to the switching node and connect it 
with a short trace to minimize the parasitic capacitances coupled to the SW node. 
• Keep the signal traces like the VOS sense line away from SW or other noisy sources. 
Refer to Figure 11 for a recommended PCB layout.
