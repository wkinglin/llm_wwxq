GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM4915 is a dual audio power amplifier with 
active low shutdown mode. It is designed to maximize 
audio performance in portable applications. The audio 
power amplifier is designed for the portable application 
that needs low-component count and can operate from 
a single 2.5V to 5.5V power supply. Under the condition 
of using a 5.0V power supply to drive a 16Ω speaker, it 
can deliver a continuous average power of 145mW per 
channel, and the distortion (THD) is less than 0.1%.  
The SGM4915 provides an active-low, micro-power 
consumption shutdown mode which is controlled 
externally and an internal thermal shutdown protection. 
The SGM4915 is applied to low power portable 
systems. Bootstrap capacitors or snubber networks are 
not needed. 
The SGM4915 provides an externally controlled gain 
(with resistors), as well as an externally controlled 
turn-on time (with the bypass capacitor) for maximum 
flexibility. 
The SGM4915 is available in a Green TDFN-2×2-8L 
package. It operates over an ambient temperature 
range of -40℃ to +85℃.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.
