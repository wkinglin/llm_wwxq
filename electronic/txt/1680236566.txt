GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM66099C is an ultra-low quiescent current 
synchronous Boost converter. An operating input voltage 
range from 1.6V to 5.2V is suitable for Li-Mn battery, 
NiMH and Li-Ion rechargeable batteries. The 1.7μA (TYP) 
quiescent current maximizes the light load efficiency 
and also increases the effective battery operation time. 
In addition, the high-side synchronous rectifier provides 
output disconnect feature which minimizes unnecessary 
current drawn from the battery during shutdown mode. 
The SGM66099C is able to deliver 300mA output 
current from 3.3V to 5V conversion, and achieves 93% 
peak efficiency at 200mA load. 
The device offers down mode where the desired output 
voltage is regulated even when the input voltage is 
higher than the output. In addition, when the input 
voltage is 300mV above the output voltage set point, 
the device enters pass-through mode. 
The device integrates various protection features such 
as over-voltage protection and thermal shutdown. In 
addition, the synchronous rectifier supports short-circuit 
protection which further improves the robustness of the 
device. 
The SGM66099C offers adjustable output voltage 
version. It is available in Green WLCSP-1.3×0.83-6B 
and TDFN-2×2-6AL packages.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
The SGM66099C synchronous Boost converter is 
designed for Li-Ion battery powered systems, where the 
compact solution size and battery operation time are 
key criterions. The device employs peak current mode 
control with 1.16A (TYP) peak switch current limit. The 
SGM66099C is capable of disconnecting the output from 
input when the device is disabled to avoid unnecessary 
current consumption. The integrated down mode and 
pass-through mode ensure a smooth operation when 
input voltage is close to or higher than the set output 
voltage. The device is available in an adjustable output 
voltage version. 
 
Start-up and Enable 
Logic high on EN pin enables the SGM66099C, while a 
logic low disables the device. During logic low state, the 
device stops operation, and the output voltage is 
completely disconnected from the input voltage. During 
logic low state, the shutdown current is less than 1μA. 
The SGM66099C is able to start up from 1.6V input 
voltage with larger than 3kΩ load. Before the output 
voltage reaches 2.2V during the start-up phase, the 
switch current is limited to about 350mA (TYP). 
Therefore, if the load during start-up is too heavy, the 
device will fail to charge the output voltage to above 
2.2V after soft-start time expires, and it will not be able 
to start up successfully. 
 
Over-Current and Short-Circuit Protection 
The SGM66099C implements cycle-by-cycle current 
limit during an over-current event. When the current limit 
threshold (ILIM) is reached, the low-side power MOSFET 
is turned off to prevent the inductor current from further 
increase. During over-current event, the output voltage 
will drop until a constant power state is reached 
between input and output. If the current limit causes the 
output 
to 
drop 
below 
the 
input 
voltage, 
the 
SGM66099C goes into down mode, where the peak 
current is still limited by the current limit threshold 
cycle-by-cycle. If the output continues to drop below 
2.2V, the device automatically enters short-circuit 
condition with 350mA (TYP) reduced current limit. 
During the output short-to-ground case, as output 
voltage declines below 2.2V, the SGM66099C reduces 
the current limit to about 350mA (TYP) to reduce power 
dissipation within the device. As the short-circuit 
condition is removed, the device resumes operation 
and goes through a soft-start sequence to regulate the 
set output voltage.  
 
Over-Voltage Protection (OVP) 
SGM66099C integrates over-voltage protection to 
protect the device in case of feedback resistor 
short-to-ground or incorrect feedback resistor value 
being populated. The SGM66099C stops switching 
when the OVP threshold of 5.8V (TYP) is reached. The 
device implements 50mV OVP hysteresis. When the 
output voltage is 50mV lower than the OVP threshold, 
the device resumes switching. 
 
Power-Save Mode under Light Load 
Condition 
SGM66099C enters power-save mode under light load 
condition. 
 
Down Mode and Pass-Through Mode 
SGM66099C offers down mode feature where the 
device can still regulate the set output voltage even 
when the input voltage is higher than output voltage. If 
the input voltage continues increasing in down mode, 
the device automatically enters pass-through mode. 
Care should be taken in pass-through mode, where the 
input voltage should not exceed the recommended 
maximum input voltage. 
In down mode, the control logic pulls the gate of PMOS 
to the input voltage rather than ground. This method 
allows effective control of inductor current when VIN > 
VOUT. Thermal consideration should be taken in down 
mode, where the voltage drop across the PMOS 
increases as the delta of VIN and VOUT increases.  
In pass-through mode, the complimentary switching 
action stops. The gate of PMOS is pulled to ground for 
always-on and the low-side switch remains off. The 
output voltage equals to the input voltage minus the 
voltage drop across the DC resistance of the inductor 
and the on-resistance of the rectifying PMOS.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
The SGM66099C enters down mode when the input 
voltage is equal to or higher than VOUT - 100mV. It 
remains in down mode until VIN > VOUT + 0.3V and then 
automatically enters pass-through mode. In the 
pass-through mode, the high-side PMOS is always 
turned on to pass the input voltage to the output. As VIN 
drops below 1% above the target output voltage, the 
device exits pass-through mode and returns to down 
mode. The device exits down mode and returns to 
normal Boost switching operation as VIN drops 250mV 
below the target output voltage.

Thermal Shutdown 
A thermal shutdown function is implemented to prevent 
damage caused by excessive heat and power 
dissipation. Once a junction temperature of +150℃
(TYP) is exceeded, the device is shut down. The device 
is released from shutdown automatically when the 
junction temperature decreases by 25℃.

The leakage current into the FB pin affects the 
accuracy of output voltage. To achieve the minimum 
leakage current effect, the current through R2 should be 
100 times greater than the FB pin leakage current. 
Small R2 increases the noise immunity, while large R2 
reduces the leakage current flowing through feedback 
resistors, which improves the no load efficiency of the 
device. A 1MΩ resistor is chosen for R1 and a 249kΩ 
resistor is chosen for R2 in this case. ±1% accuracy 
resistors are recommended for R1 and R2 to improve 
output voltage accuracy. 
Maximum Output Current 
The maximum output load capability of SGM66099C 
depends on the minimum desired operation input 
voltage and the current limit of the device. Equation 2

current limit (ILIM) should be used. 
 
Inductor Selection 
Inductor selection is one of the most important 
criterions for switch mode power supply, because the 
inductor selection may affect the power supply’s 
transient response, loop stability, efficiency and 
steady-state operation. Inductor parameters of DC 
resistance, inductance and saturation current are 
critical for a smooth and efficient power supply 
operation. 
The internal compensation of the device is optimized 
with 1.0μH and 2.2μH. When VOUT is higher than 3V, 
2.2μH inductance should be selected. When VOUT is 
less than 3V, 1.0μH inductance should be selected.

Capacitor Selection 
The input capacitor of Boost converter not only 
minimizes the input voltage ripple, but also reduces any 
voltage spike presenting on the VIN pin. A 10μF, low 
ESR and X5R or higher temperature coefficient 
ceramic capacitor is recommended to place as close to 
the VIN and GND pins as possible to improve transient 
response and EMI behavior. 
Boost converter’s output capacitor plays a significant 
role in ensuring good system performance. The 
location of output capacitor will have an effect on the 
switching spikes on the SW pin, which ultimately affects 
EMI performance and potentially damages the device 
due to large switching spikes. The current loop formed 
by the output capacitor flowing from the VOUT pin and 
back to the GND pin should be as small as possible. 
Therefore, a ceramic cap is recommended to put as 
close to the VOUT and GND pins of the device as 
possible.  
Boost topology presents right-half-plane-zero which is 
dictated by inductance. In addition, the output capacitor 
sets the corner frequency of the converter for current 
mode controlled method. Therefore, when selects a 
larger inductor, there should be a larger output 
capacitor. The device’s internal compensation is 
optimized to operate with inductance values between 
1.0μH and 2.2μH, resulting in the minimum output 
capacitor value of 20μF (nominal value). Increasing the 
output capacitor can reduce output ripple in PWM 
mode. 
Due to the nature of ceramic capacitors’ DC bias effect, 
effective capacitance at the bias voltage should be 
verified. GRM188R61E106MA73D is used as the 
output capacitor in this case. In the case of load 
hot-plugging, the input capacitance of load device 
needs to be less than 1/10 of the output capacitance of 
SGM66099C. 
Layout Considerations 
In addition to component selection, layout is a critical 
step to ensure the performance of any switch mode 
power supplies. Poor layout could result in system 
instability, EMI failure, and device damage. Thus, place 
the inductor, input and output capacitors as close to the 
device as possible, and use wide and short traces for 
current carrying traces to minimize PCB inductance. 
For Boost converter, the current loop of the output 
capacitor from VOUT pin back to the GND pin of the 
device should be as small as possible.
