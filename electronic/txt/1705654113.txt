GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM6601 is a high-frequency Boost converter. 
The input voltage accepts a range of 1.8V to 5.5V. It is 
specified for small to medium LCD bias supply and 
white LED backlight supplies. The switching frequency 
can reach up to 1MHz, which supports both ceramic 
output capacitors and tantalum output capacitors.  
 
The internal 400mA switch current limit provides a low 
output voltage ripple. For low-power applications, this 
device allows the use of a small form factor inductor. A 
typical low quiescent current of 20μA together with an 
optimized control scheme allows the device to achieve 
very high efficiency over the whole load current. 
 
The adjustable output voltage can reach a maximum of 
38V ideally with a dual-cell NiMH/NiCd battery or a 
single cell Li-Ion battery. And a standard 3.3V/5V to 
12V power conversion can also be achieved. 
 
The SGM6601 is available in TDFN-2×2-6L and 
TSOT-23-5 packages. It operates over an ambient 
temperature range of -40℃ to +85℃.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
Overview 
The SGM6601 is a high voltage non-synchronous 
Boost converter and integrates a 400mA low-side 
power FET. It is capable of accepting output voltage up 
to 38V, and supports input voltage range from 1.8V to 
5.5V. The SGM6601 implements the output voltage 
comparator and constant peak current limit architecture 
to regulate the output voltage. The SGM6601 operates 
with 1MHz nominal switching frequency which allows 
the use of small external components. 
 
The internal error amplifier of SGM6601 constantly 
monitors the output voltage. As soon as the FB node 
voltage falls below the reference voltage, the low-side 
(LS) FET turns on to ramp up the inductor current until 
the 400mA (TYP) switch current is reached. For wide 
Boost ratio applications, an additional maximum 
on-time of 6μs (TYP) will terminate the LS FET on-time. 
After the LS FET turns off, the high-side rectifier is 
forward biased to deliver the inductor current to supply 
the load and replenish the output capacitor. There is a 
430ns minimal off-time which dictates the LS FET 
off-time and the LS FET is triggered to turn on again 
once the feedback voltage drops below the reference 
voltage. 
 
Peak Current Control 
The SGM6601 turns off the LS FET when the inductor 
current reaches 400mA (TYP). The propagation delay 
of the current limit comparator contributes 100ns (TYP) 
of delay time during switching, and uses equation 
below to calculate the actual peak current.

ILIM = 400mA 
 
Soft-Start 
The SGM6601 integrates soft-start feature to reduce 
the inrush current during start-up. The device gradually 
increases the current limit threshold upon device 
enabling, the current limit is clamped at 1/3 of ILIM (TYP) 
for 256 switching cycles, then released to 1/2 of ILIM 
(TYP) for another 256 switching cycles, and lastly the 
full ILIM (TYP). 
 
Enable 
The SGM6601 consumes 0.1μA (TYP) shutdown 
current when EN pin is pulled low. When the EN pin is 
low, the input voltage will bypass to the output via the 
high-side rectifier diode. Do not leave the EN pin 
floating. 
 
Under-Voltage Lockout 
The SGM6601 implements an input under-voltage 
lockout threshold of 1.5V. When the input voltage 
applied to VIN pin is below 1.5V, the device remains off.  
 
Thermal Shutdown 
A thermal shutdown function is implemented to prevent 
damage caused by excessive heat and power 
dissipation. Once the junction temperature of +155℃ 
(TYP) is exceeded, the device is shut down. The device 
is released from shutdown automatically when the 
junction temperature decreases by 20℃.

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
The SGM6601’s output voltage regulation architecture 
is inherently stable, thus the inductance does not affect 
the stability of the device. The load current and 
conversion ratio affect the switching frequency of 
SGM6601. The recommended inductance of SGM6601 
ranges from 2.2μH to 47μH. The selected inductance 
should ensure that the LS on-time does not exceed 6μs 
(TYP) maximum on-time, and the peak current of 
400mA (TYP) should be reached within the 6μs for 
proper operation.  
 
Equation below calculates the maximum switching 
frequency. The selected inductance determines the 
maximum switching frequency of SGM6601.

The position of operation point, the maximum load 
current, is at where the converter begins to enter the 
continuous conduction mode. In general, the converter 
is supposed to operate in discontinuous conduction 
mode. 
 
The selected inductor should have a saturation rating 
higher than the 400mA (TYP) peak current limit. The 
DC resistance of the selected inductor affects the 
conversion efficiency, and lower DC resistance results 
in higher efficiency.

Output Voltage Setting 
Connecting a resistive divider on the FB pin programs 
the output voltage of SGM6601. Use equation below to 
program the output voltage. R1 is the top feedback 
resistor and R2 is the bottom feedback resistor. The 
recommended value for R2 should be less than 200kΩ, 
and the maximum value for R1 should be less than 
2.2MΩ.

APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued)
Lower switching frequency requires larger feedforward 
capacitor, and larger feedforward capacitance results in 
poor line regulation. The selected feedforward capacitor 
should be as small as possible. 
 
Line and Load Regulation 
The SGM6601 requires a 45mV peak-to-peak voltage 
ripple on the FB pin to achieve good line regulation. For 
application with constraint on the total output 
capacitance, a feedforward capacitor is recommended 
to increase the voltage ripple coupled to the FB pin. It is 
recommended to use small inductor value to increase 
the switching frequency which will reduce the output 
voltage ripple, as well as the voltage ripple coupled to 
the feedback pin. In addition, a capacitor connected in 
parallel with the bottom feedback resistor can reduce 
the voltage ripple on the feedback pin down to 45mV, a 
starting point for this capacitor value could be the same 
as the chosen feedforward capacitor. 
 
EN Pin Protection 
Power input VIN may exhibit very high voltage spike (> 
2 × VIN) under certain situations such as hot swap or 
hot-insertion. In order to prevent SGM6601 from being 
damaged by high voltage spike and protect EN pin 
during power-on, when connecting EN to VIN, a pull-up 
resistor (> 1kΩ) is recommended to be added between 
EN and VIN instead of connecting them directly (Figure 
1). 
 
Output Capacitor Selection 
A low ESR ceramic capacitor is recommended to place 
at the SGM6601’s output. Use equation below to 
estimate the output voltage ripple under normal 
operation.

Vd = Rectifier diode forward voltage (typically 0.3 V) 
COUT = Selected output capacitor 
ESR = Output capacitor ESR value 
 
Input Capacitor 
Boost converter’s input capacitor sees continuous 
current throughout the entire switching cycle. A 4.7µF 
ceramic capacitor is recommended to place as close as 
possible between the VCC pin and GND pin of 
SGM6601. For the applications where the SGM6601 is 
located far away from the input source, a 47µF or 
higher capacitance capacitor is recommended to damp 
the wiring harness’s inductance. 
 
Schottky Diode Selection 
The external rectification diode selection is critical to 
ensure device performance. A high speed and low 
forward voltage drop diode is recommended to improve 
efficiency. The average current rating of the diode 
should be higher than the peak load. The breakdown 
voltage of the selected diode should be higher than the 
programmed output voltage with margin, for example, a 
12V output application requires a minimal of 20V 
breakdown voltage.  
 
Layout Guidelines 
In addition to component selection, layout is a critical 
step to ensure the performance of any switch mode 
power supplies. Poor layout can result in system 
instability, EMI failure, and device damage. Thus, place 
the inductor, input and output capacitors as close to the 
IC as possible. Wide and short traces can be used to 
minimize PCB inductance for current carrying traces. 
For Boost converter, the output capacitor’s current loop 
from VOUT pin back to the GND pin of the device should 
be as small as possible.
