GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM63600 is a 4.3V to 60V current mode controller 
for synchronous Buck converters. It is capable to 
efficiently drive two N-MOSFETs over the whole voltage 
range. 
This device uses accurate cycle-by-cycle current limiting 
in PWM operation. Power-save mode (PSM) is used at 
light load to keep high efficiency. It can also enter 
non-synchronous PWM mode if the PSM is enabled. 
Switching frequency can be set by an external resistor 
(RFREQ), or an external clock (SYNC input) for low noise 
applications. The protection functions include UVLO, 
thermal 
shutdown, 
accurate 
output 
over-voltage 
protection (OVP) and over-current protection (OCP). 
The SGM63600 is available in Green TQFN-3×4-20L 
and TSSOP-20 (Exposed Pad) packages. It can 
operate in the -40°C to +125°C junction temperature 
range.

NOTE: 
1. The UVLO rising voltage is 5V, while its falling voltage is 
below 4.3V. Therefore, the input voltage must be higher than 
5V for startup, and the SGM63600 can work down to 4.3V 
input voltage after startup. 
 
OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.

PIN DESCRIPTION 
PIN 
NAME 
FUNCTION 
TQFN 
TSSOP 
1 
3 
VCC2 
Secondary Supply Input for the Internal VCC1 Regulator. Power input from VIN is disabled when 
VCC2 is above VCC2 UVLO threshold. VCC2 supply must not exceed 32V. 
2 
4 
VCC1 
Internal Bias Supply Rail. Decouple this pin to SGND with a 1μF to 4.7µF ceramic capacitor. 
3 
5 
SGND 
Low Noise Signal Ground Return. 
4 
6 
SS 
Soft-Start Pin. Place an external capacitor (CSS) between this pin and the SGND to set the soft-start 
time. 
5 
7 
COMP 
Compensation Pin. Use an RC network from COMP to SGND to compensate the internal loop. This 
network converts the current from the error amplifier to the control voltage. 
6 
8 
FB 
Feedback Input Pin. Connects to the midpoint of the output resistor divider. The FB voltage is 
compared to the 0.8V internal reference to set the output regulation voltage. 
7 
9 
CCM/PSM 
Set Pin for Selection of Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM) or Power-Save Mode (PSM). For CCM, 
float this pin or connect it to VCC1. For PSM, place a resistor (RPSM) from this pin to SGND to choose 
PSM operation at light load. Light load voltage level for PSM voltage must be above 480mV. 
8 
10 
FREQ 
Switching Frequency Set Pin. An external resistor (RFREQ) from FREQ to SGND sets the switching 
frequency. 
9 
11 
PG 
Open-Drain Power Good Output. 
10 
12 
ILIM 
Current Limit Setting Pin. The ILIM pin voltage determines the nominal sensed voltage threshold 
across the sense resistor for the peak inductor current (IPK). With ILIM, the current limit threshold can 
be set to 3 fixed values: 27mV if ILIM is grounded, 52mV if ILIM is shorted to VCC1 and 78mV if ILIM 
is left float. 
11 
13 
SYNCO 
SYNC Clock Output. It is a 180° out-of-phase output clock relative to the clock source (internal oscillator 
or external SYNC) that is available only in CCM or DCM mode (not in sleep mode). This pin is used for 
dual channel applications. In all other modes such as sleep mode, low dropout and fault events the 
SYNCO outputs a DC voltage. 
12 
14 
SENSE- 
Current-Sense Negative Input (Connects to the current-sense resistor in series with the inductor). 
13 
15 
SENSE+ 
Current-Sense Positive Input (Connects to the current-sense resistor in series with the inductor). 
14 
16 
PGND 
Power Ground. Power ground return for input supply, external low-side switch, load, internal low-side 
switch driver. 
15 
17 
BG 
Gate Driving Output for the Low-side Switch (the external synchronous N-MOSFET). 
16 
18 
SW 
Switching Node. Connects to the switching node of the converter and acts as return for the VBST 
supply and provides a path for the high-side switch high bootstrapping currents. 
17 
19 
TG 
Gate Driving Output for the High-side Switch. Drives the high-side N-MOSFET. The TG driver is 
powered from the bootstrap (BST) capacitor (returned to SW) that is a floating supply. 
18 
20 
BST 
Bootstrap Pin. The bootstrap capacitor (CBST) is placed between BST and SW pins. BST acts as the 
supply for the high-side switch floating driver. A diode from VCC1 to BST charges CBST when the 
low-side switch is on. 
19 
1 
IN 
Power Supply Input Pin. Place a decoupling ceramic capacitor between this pin and PGND. 
20 
2 
EN/SYNC 
Enable and/or SYNC Input. A low DC signal on this pin will disable the device and a high DC voltage 
will enable it. EN can be used to increase (set) the input UVLO threshold with a resistor divider from 
VIN input. If a CLOCK signal is sensed on this pin, it will act as SYNC input and the internal clock 
frequency will be locked and synced with that.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
The SGM63600 is a wide input synchronous Buck 
current mode controller for MOSFET based DC/DC 
Buck 
converters. 
Using 
current 
mode 
control 
architecture and adjustable switching frequency, it can 
regulate the output voltage with high accuracy through 
two external N-MOSFETs. 
The COMP pin voltage reflects the amplified error 
signal between the sensed output voltage at the FB pin 
and the internal 0.8V reference. This voltage is 
compared with the sensed inductor current plus a slope 
compensation ramp to generate the gate pulse signals 
for switch control. 
The controller operates in PWM mode unless the load 
is light and PSM mode is selected. The high-side switch 
gate pulse is turned on at the beginning of each cycle 
and stays on for the ON-time (duty cycle is determined 
by the controller). Then the top gate turns off and after 
a short dead time the bottom gate is turned on until the 
end of the cycle. 
 
Under-Voltage Lockout (UVLO) 
The Under-voltage lockout protection is necessary to 
avoid device malfunction due to insufficient VIN supply 
voltage. The rising and falling UVLO thresholds of the 
SGM63600 are about 4.6V and 3.9V respectively. 
 
Adjustable UVLO (EN Input) 
The EN/SYNC pin acts as an active high enable input. 
This pin uses an accurate 1.23V threshold that can be 
used to set a higher level for the VIN UVLO. Pulling this 
pin high enables the device and pulling it low (for at 
least 12μs) disables it. 
To set the UVLO, the EN/SYNC pin needs to be tied to 
VIN with a resistor divider (REN1 and REN2 in Figure 3). 
The EN falling threshold is 1.15V, therefore the new VIN 
UVLO falling threshold will be 1.15V × (1+ REN1/REN2). 
Make sure EN/SYNC pin voltage is always below 50V 
in input high-voltage applications. 
 
Figure 3. EN Resistor Divider 
Synchronization (SYNC Input) 
The internal oscillator can synchronize to an external 
logic clock applied to the EN/SYNC pin in the 100kHz 
to 1000kHz range. The rising edge of the internal clock 
syncs with rising edge of the external clock. 
It is recommended that the on and off pulse widths of 
external clock are both more than 100ns. 
 
Startup and Shutdown 
The SGM63600 will start up if VIN is above UVLO and 
the enable pin is active high. First the voltage reference 
circuitry is powered to get stable voltages and current 
references and then the internal regulator is turned on 
to supply the remaining circuitry. 
The device shuts down if one of the following three 
events occurs:  
1. Enable goes low; 
2. VIN falls below UVLO; 
3. Die temperature exceeds shutdown threshold. 
During shutdown, the shutdown signal path is blocked 
to prevent any other fault triggering and then the COMP 
pin and the internal supply rail are pulled down. The 
floating high-side driver is not included in the shutdown 
process. 
 
Pre-Bias Start-Up 
The SGM63600 can startup in pre-biased conditions. If 
a voltage is detected on the output during startup (that 
is, VFB is higher than the SS ramp), the TG and BG 
driver outputs will not turn on until the soft start ramp 
(SS) exceeds the pre-biased voltage on the output 
(FB). 
 
Soft-Start (SS) 
Soft start feature is necessary to have a smooth startup 
without over-current, output voltage transient or hiccup. 
Without soft-start, such protections may occur due to 
charging of the output capacitors or input voltage drop 
(below UVLO) due to high startup current and should 
be avoided. Soft-start is implemented by a ramp 
voltage which rises slowly from 0V towards 0.8V and 
replaces the VREF during startup for the output voltage 
regulation. When this ramp reaches or exceeds VREF, 
The VREF itself will regain control as reference for 
regulation.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Except for output OVP, for all other faults the device 
resets with a new soft start after recovery. 
The ramp slope is set by an external capacitor (CSS) 
placed between SS and SGND pins. It will be charged 
by an internal ISS = 4μA current source to generate the 
ramp voltage. The soft-start time (tSS) can be calculated 
from Equation 1: 
There is no internal soft-start capacitance inside the 
device.

Transconductance Error Amplifier (EA) 
The difference between VFB and the internal reference 
(VREF = 0.8V) is amplified to an output current signal at 
COMP pin with a GEA (A/V) gain. This current is injected 
in the compensation network to generate the VCOMP 
control signal that determines the inductor (switch) 
current by controlling duty cycle. The control loop 
response is determined by the RC network between the 
COMP and SGND pins and can be optimized for best 
stability and transient response. 
 
PSM Mode 
An optional power-save mode (PSM) is provided in 
SGM63600 to improve light or no load efficiency. This 
option can be enabled by pulling CCM/PSM pin low 
with a proper resistor (RPSM) such that the pin voltage 
(VPSM) is above 480mV. Equation 2 can be used to 
determine the RPSM: 
VPSM (mV) = IPSM (μA) × RPSM (kΩ) 
 
(2) 
The IPSM is the PSM pin output current given by 
Equation 3: 
PSM
FREQ
600mV
I
 = R
 (kΩ)   
 
 
(3) 
The RFREQ is the frequency setting resistor connected 
between the FREQ and SGND pins and its value is 
calculated from the equation given in the Switching 
Frequency Selection section. 
If the CCM/PSM pin is floating or connected to VCC1 
the PSM will be disabled. 
If PSM is enabled, and load is large enough to have 
continuous 
conduction, 
the 
converter 
continues 
operation like PWM, but if load is reduced and inductor 
current 
reaches 
zero, 
the 
device 
first 
enters 
non-synchronous 
operation 
without 
frequency 
reduction in which the bottom switch turns off when 
inductor current reaches to zero in each cycle. If the 
load is further decreased to very light or no load, the 
VCOMP falls below the PSM threshold (≈ VPSM + VOFFSET), 
and the SGM63600 enters PSM mode with frequency 
reduction (VOFFSET ≈ 190mV). In this mode, a new cycle 
starts whenever VCOMP exceeds the PSM threshold. 
The time reference for the next cycle is the VCOMP 
crossover time. If the load gets heavier, the DC 
component of the VCOMP will increase and when it 
exceeds the PSM threshold, the device will operate 
with fixed frequency again (in DCM or CCM depending 
on load).

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Floating Driver and Bootstrap Charging 
The floating top gate driver is powered by an external 
bootstrap capacitor (CBST), which is normally refreshed 
when the high-side MOSFET turns off. This floating 
driver has its own UVLO protection. This UVLO’s falling 
threshold is 3.05V with a hysteresis of 600mV. 
 
Internal Regulator (VCC1) and Secondary 
Supply (VCC2) 
Almost all internal circuits and the gate drivers are 
powered from the internal low dropout VCC1 regulator 
that receives power from VIN or VCC2. VCC1 must be 
decoupled to SGND with a 1μF to 4.7μF ceramic 
capacitor. 
When the VCC2 pin is float or has low voltage (< 4.4V), 
VCC1 will be powered from VIN by a 5V regulator. If 
VCC2 is high enough (> 4.7V), the 5V regulator from VIN 
will be disabled and another 5V regulator turns on to 
supply VCC1 from VCC2. When 4.4V < VCC2 < 5V, this 
regulator operates in dropout mode and VCC1 is almost 
equal to VCC2. If VCC2 > 5V (not exceed 32V), then 
VCC1 will be regulated at 5V. Supplying from VCC2 
provides better efficiency when a source is available. If 
the converter output can be used to supply VCC2, it is 
in the 4.7V to 32V range. 
 
Current Limit 
Current limit can be set to 3 fixed values selected by an 
ILIM pin. If ILIM pin is grounded, the sensed voltage 
threshold (VILIMIT) for current limit is 27mV. It will be 
52mV when ILIM pin is connected to VCC1 and 78mV 
when ILIM pin is floating. 
If the inductor peak current tends to exceed this limit, 
the output voltage will start to drop to reduce the load 
current. If VFB falls below 62.5% of VREF, the device 
enters hiccup mode in which the device will turn off 
switching and restart cyclically until the over current 
fault is cleared. If VFB falls below 0.5V the frequency 
foldback will reduce the switching frequency as well. 
This reduction is particularly helpful when an extended 
short circuit to ground occurs and significantly reduces 
the average short current and device overheating. 
 
Low Dropout Mode 
A low dropout operating mode is included to minimize 
converter dropout when input voltage is close to the 
output voltage. In this mode the duty cycle is kept at 
maximum (the high-side switch on-time is maximized) as 
much as bootstrap UVLO voltage allows. The off-time 
must be sufficient to recharge the bootstrap capacitor 
such that the bootstrap voltage (VBST - VSW) remains 
above its UVLO threshold (3.05V). If it falls below its 
UVLO the high-side switch (HS) is turned off and the 
low-side switch (LS) is turned on to recharge the CBST 
capacitor. After the recharge, the HS is turned on again 
to regulate the output. As long as the VBST voltage is 
above its UVLO, the HS switch can remain on for more 
than one cycle and only is turned off shortly for 
refreshing the CBST capacitor. This will increase the 
regulator effective duty cycle. The maximum on-time of 
high-side switch is 30µs typically. 
This mode is a very useful feature of the SGM63600 in 
some application such as automotive cold cranking. 
 
Power Good Indicator (PG) 
The open-drain power good output goes high whenever 
the output is within ±10% of regulation (TYP). PG is 
pulled low if the output voltage goes out of the ±10% 
range. The pull-up voltage must be 5V or lower. Usually, 
a large resistor (e.g., 100kΩ) is used for pull-up. The 
PG indicator reaction delay time is 25μs. 
To ensure that the PG is low logic with no input for 
SGM63600, it is recommended to pull up the PG pin to 
the VCC1 of SGM63600. 
 
Output Over-Voltage Protection (OVP) 
The output voltage is monitored through FB pin voltage 
and if it exceeds for about 16% above the VREF, an OVP 
will be triggered. When OVP occurs, device enters 
discharge mode in which HS is turned off and LS is 
turned on until the reverse current limit is triggered. At 
this point the LS will be also turned off and inductor 
current rises to zero. The LS will be turned on again in 
the next cycle. The discharge mode will continue until 
the over-voltage condition is cleared. 
 
Thermal Shutdown 
To protect the device from overheating damage the 
junction temperature is constantly monitored and if it 
reaches the +175°C limit the device will shut down. It 
will automatically recover normal operation with a soft 
start when the die cools down for about 25°C and the 
temperature falls below +150°C (TYP).

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
Output Voltage Setting 
The output voltage is set using an external resistor 
divider as shown in Figure 5. 
 
Figure 5. Output Voltage (VOUT) Setting 
Use Equation 4 to calculate the divider resistors for a 
desired output voltage (VOUT). Select low tolerance 
resistors for the divider (1% or better) for more accurate 
and thermally stable output. Choose a reasonable 
value for RFB2 considering divider loss (RFB1 + RFB2 not 
too small) and FB leakage/bias current offsets at 
highest operating temperature and noise sensitivity 
(RFB1||RFB2 not too large). Table 1 lists some proper 
resistor values for more common output voltages.

Current Sensing and Limit Setting 
A current sensing resistor (RSENSE) should be placed in 
series with the inductor on the load side. RSENSE value is 
selected based on the desired current limit threshold. 
Use Equation 5 to find the proper RSENSE value based 
on the desired peak inductor current (IPK) and the 
current limit sense voltage selected by ILIM pin as 
described below. RSENSE is typically selected in the 5mΩ 
to 50mΩ range.

The ILIM pin can be connected to ground, VCC1 or 
kept floating to set three fixed VILIMIT values of 27mV, 
52mV and 78mV. 
 
Switching Frequency Selection 
Several parameters such as losses, inductor and 
capacitors sizes and response time are considered in 
selection of the switching frequency. Higher frequency 
increases the switching and gate charge losses and 
lower frequency requires larger inductance and 
capacitances and results in larger overall physical size 
and higher cost. Therefore, a tradeoff is needed 
between losses and component size. If the application 
is noise-sensitive to a frequency range, the frequency 
should be selected out of that range. 
The switching frequency of the SGM63600 can be set 
between 100kHz to 1000kHz using a resistor placed 
between FREQ and SGND pins. Equation 6 can be 
used to calculate the RFREQ to set the desired operating 
frequency to fSW.

As an example, for fSW = 500kHz a 39kΩ resistor can 
be chosen for RFREQ. The resistor values for some 
common frequencies are given in Table 2. The 
SGM63600 does not work if the FREQ pin is floating, 
and the switching frequency is out of the normal 
frequency range if the FREQ pin is shorted to GND.

APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued) 
Powering VCC1 Regulator 
The internal VCC1 regulator can be powered from both 
VIN and VCC2 as shown in Figure 6. Powering from 
VCC2 with a proper voltage improves the regulator 
efficiency. VCC2 voltage should be between 4.7V to 
32V. 
 
Figure 6. Connecting VCC2 External Supply for More 
Efficient Powering of the Device (VCC1 Regulator) 
If VOUT is between 4.7V and 32V, the VCC2 can be 
connected to VOUT through 5.1Ω resistor as shown in 
Figure 7.  
 
Figure 7. Powering VCC2 from VOUT 
 
Inductor 
The inductance is typically selected such that the 
current peak-to-peak ripple (ΔIL) is between 20% to 40% 
of the load current. The DC current rating of the 
selected inductor should be at least 25% above the 
maximum load current. The inductor saturation current 
must be high enough such that it does not saturate in 
any normal or transient operating condition. Use 
Equation 7 to calculate the inductance. ΔIL can be 
selected equal to 30% of maximum load current.

Input Capacitor (CIN) 
The input capacitor is necessary to circulate the high 
frequency ripples and switching currents of the 
converter and keep them away from the input line and 
the source. The input voltage ripple must be small 
enough to avoid device malfunctions. The selected 
capacitors must have enough RMS current rating to 
absorb all AC currents on the input. Equation 9 can be 
used to calculate the input capacitor current ripple:

The worst-case occurs at 50% duty cycle where VIN = 2 
× VOUT, resulting in IRMS = ILOAD/2. 
 
Output Capacitor (COUT) 
The output capacitor is designed based on the required 
output voltage ripple, stability, and transient response 
peaks and settling times. COUT impedance must be 
lower than the load at the switching frequency. The 
output voltage ripple is estimated from Equation 10:

RESR is the equivalent series resistance (ESR) of the 
capacitor. For tantalum or electrolytic capacitors, the 
ESR is high and dominates the capacitor impedance at

Compensation Network 
The SGM63600 is a current-mode controller that 
simplifies compensation and provides faster transient 
response compared to the voltage mode control. The 
COMP pin is the error amplifier output and controls 
stability and loop response. A series RC network sets a 
pole-zero combination and determines control loop 
characteristics. The DC gain of the voltage feedback 
loop is shown in Equation 12:

where AO = 3000V/V (70dB) is the error-amplifier voltage 
gain, GCS is the current-sense transconductance (1/(13 × 
RSENSE) in A/V), and RLOAD is the load resistance. 
 
Figure 8. SGM63600 External Compensation 
 
This system has two poles. One is determined by the 
compensation network (CCOMP in Figure 8 and the EA 
output conductance) and the other one is determined 
by the converter and load (COUT and RLOAD), as given in

The main goal of the compensation network is to adjust 
the shape of the converter transfer function to get a 
desired loop gain. The crossover frequency at which 
the loop gain is 1 (0dB) is an important factor that 
determines the bandwidth (how fast is the converter 
transient response). Setting the crossover at a too high 
frequency, results in instability. 
For design, the crossover frequency is initially set to 
around 10% of the switching frequency (0.1 × fS) and 
then the following steps are taken to design the 
compensation network with the sufficient phase margin: 
1. Select RCOMP based on the desired crossover

2. Select CCOMP to get sufficient phase margin. In the 
applications using typical inductor values, placing the

sufficient and CCOMP can be calculated using Equation

LAYOUT DESIGN 
PCB layout is an important part of the converter design. 
A weak layout can results in poor performance, 
resistive losses, EMI issues and instability problems. 
The following guidelines are helpful for designing a 
good layout for the SGM63600: 
1. Place the input capacitor as close as possible to the 
switches (drain of the high-side switch and the source 
of the low-side switch) to keep the input AC current loop 
as small as possible. 
2. The SW node trace area should be as short as 
possible and wide enough to carry the switch currents. 
Keep them away from sensitive traces such as 
feedback resistors and traces. 
3. Use small size high frequency decoupling capacitors 
near input and ground pins. 
4. Sensitive signals and feedback loop should be away 
from noisy traces and components such as SW node, 
gate driver and switching side of the inductor body. 
Place divider resistor as close as possible to the FB 
and SGND pins. 
5. Route the SENSE+, SENSE- as paired traces with 
smallest distance and loop area. Use a filter capacitor 
across sense signals close to the IC pins. Place two 
capacitors separately. One is between the SENSE+ pin 
and SGND, and the other is between the SENSE- pin 
and SGND. These two filter capacitors also should be 
close to the IC pins. 
6. Use a short and wide shunt resistor for current 
sensing. 
7. Place decoupling capacitors on VCC1 and VCC2 as 
close as possible to those pins. 
8. Route the gate drive traces as straight as possible. 
The traces that carry forward and return currents must 
be close together (side-by-side on a single layer or over 
each other on adjacent layers) to minimize the gate 
drive path parasitic inductance.  
9. SGND and PGND are connected to a single point on 
the exposed pad of the IC. 
10. The ground connection between the input capacitor 
and the IC must be kept as short as possible. It is 
recommended to use vias to connect large copper 
planes on other layers for a more efficient ground 
connection between the ground of the input capacitor 
and the ground of the IC. 
11. Use large copper areas on all layers and stich them 
with thermal vias for better heat transfer and dissipation 
especially for heavy load applications.
