FEBRUARY2023–REV.A.1 
GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM25701 is a positive hot swap controller that 
allows a board to be safely inserted or removed from a 
live backplane. Inrush current control function can 
effectively reduce the voltage drop on the power supply 
rail. 
The SGM25701 offers programmable power-limiting 
and current limit to ensure that the external MOSFET 
operates within its safe operating area (SOA) at all 
times. 
The chip has a good output indication function when 
the VOUT increases to within the 1.4V range of the VIN. 
Programmable under-voltage lockout or over-voltage 
lockout is used to turn off the device if the VIN drops 
below or raises over a threshold value. The fault 
detection time and initial insertion delay time can also 
be adjusted by the user. 
The SGM25701B will latch off when a fault is detected, 
while the SGM25701A will go into auto-retry mode. 
SGM25701 is available in a Green MSOP-10 package.

NOTES:  
1. When the chip is enabled, the voltage of GATE pin is 
generally 12.7V higher than the VIN pin voltage. Therefore, 
the absolute maximum rating of VIN (80V) is only applicable 
when the chip is stopped, or since the absolute maximum 
rating of the GATE pin is also 80V, the 80V of VIN is only 
applicable when the pin is momentarily surged. 
2. An external MOSFET with VGS_TH higher than VOUT is 
required during -ve transients. This effectively prevents false 
turn-on of the MOSFET during -ve transients. 
RECOMMENDED OPERATING CONDITIONS 
Supply Voltage, VIN ................................................ 9V to 70V 
PG Voltage 
............................................................. 0V to 70V 
Junction Temperature Range 
...................... -40℃ to +125℃ 
 
OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.

PIN DESCRIPTION 
PIN 
NAME 
I/O 
FUNCTION 
1 
SENSE 
I 
Current Sense Pin. The voltage from the input pin to this pin is measured by the current flowing 
into the sense resistor. When the detected voltage at the RSENSE exceeds 55mV, it indicates that 
the circuit is in an overload state at this time, and the fault timer is started at this time. 
2 
VIN 
I 
Input Supply Voltage. It is recommended to place a small bypass capacitor close this pin.  
3 
EN/UVLO 
I 
Enable and Under-Voltage Lockout Pin. The EN/UVLO threshold is programmed by an external 
resistor divider. Internal hysteresis is controlled by a 19µA current source. The threshold of the 
turn-on voltage is set to 2.5V. It is also possible to control this pin for remote shutdown. 
4 
OVLO 
I 
Over-Voltage Lockout Pin. The over-voltage threshold is programmed by the resistor divider 
from the power supply to the OVLO terminal to GND. Hysteretic control is achieved through an 
internally programmed 19µA current source. The over-voltage shutdown threshold is set to 
2.5V. 
5 
GND 
- 
Ground. 
6 
TIMER 
I/O 
Fault Timer Pin. An external capacitor between TIMER and GND pins provides the fault time 
delay and insertion delay time. The chip's restart time is also controlled by this capacitor. 
7 
PWR 
I 
Power-Limiting Programmable Pin. The RPWR and RSENSE determine the maximum allowable 
dissipation of the external MOSFET. 
8 
PG 
O 
Power Good Indicator Pin. The VDS voltage of the external MOSFET determines its state.  
9 
OUT 
I 
Power Output Pin. Connect this pin to output (i.e., external MOSFET source). The chip monitors 
MOSFET VDS voltage through this pin to limit the MOSFET power and control the PG signal 
accordingly. 
10 
GATE 
O 
Gate Drive Output. This pin is connected to the gate of the external MOSFET. During normal 
operation, the voltage on this pin will be 12.7V higher than the OUT pin.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
Overview 
The SGM25701 is designed to limit the generated 
inrush current when the circuit card is plugged into and 
removed from the live backplane or hot power supply, 
reduce the voltage sag and dV/dt on the load during 
power-on, and avoid unnecessary reset and other 
impacts. The SGM25701 not only has current limit 
function, but also detects power dissipation when used 
in series to ensure the operations within SOA. Once the 
current limit or power-limiting exceeds the preset value, 
the SGM25701A components will repeatedly try to 
recover until the faults are removed, and the 
SGM25701B will latch off. When the input voltage 
range exceeds EN/UVLO and OVLO ranges, the 
device breaks during the period. 
 
Current Limit 
The device triggers over-current protection when the 
voltage on the RSENSE reaches the current limit 
threshold of 55mV. In this event, the device limits the 
current in M1 by controlling GATE pin, and the TIMER 
pin is active. If the current is lower than the threshold 
before the fault timeout period ends, the device 
recovers. Note that RSENSE cannot be larger than 
100mΩ. 
 
Circuit Breaker 
Once the load current rises rapidly, the current on 
RSENSE may exceed the current limit value before the 
current limit control loop responds. When the current on 
RSENSE exceeds two times the current limit value, M1 is 
pulled down by the 85mA current source to turn off 
quickly, and the fault timeout starts timing until the 
voltage on RSENSE drops below 105mV. If VTIMER 
reaches 4V before current limit or power-limiting 
ceases, M1 will be pulled off by the 2.1mA current 
source.  
 
Power-Limiting 
The power-limiting ensures that the power dissipation 
(MAX) of M1 is within the SOA of the SGM25701. The 
device defines the power dissipation of the M1 by 
sensing the VDS of the M1 and the drain current flowing 
through RSENSE. The current and voltage values will be 
compared to the resistor that is used to program the 
power-limiting value on the PWR pin. The fault timer is 
activated if the power-limiting circuit is active. 
 
EN/UVLO and OVLO 
M1 starts to work when the power supply voltage (VIN) 
operates between the under-voltage lockout value and 
the over-voltage lockout value programmed by the 
resistor network (R1, R2, R3 and R4). When the input 
supply voltage is lower than the EN/UVLO threshold, 
the 19µA current sink inside the EN/UVLO is enabled, 
the current source inside the OVLO is turned off, and 
M1 is kept off by the 2.1mA current source pull-down of 
the GATE pin. As the input supply voltage increases, 
when VEN/UVLO exceeds 2.5V, its internal 19µA current 
sink turns off to increase the EN/UVLO voltage, 
providing a threshold of hysteresis when M1 is enabled 
by the 16µA current source at GATE pin. The EN/UVLO 
pin can be connected to VIN to set the minimum 
EN/UVLO level, when the VIN reaches the power-on 
reset threshold (POREN), M1 is enabled. When the 
power supply voltage rises so that the voltage on the 
OVLO pin exceeds 2.5V, M1 is pulled down by the 
2.1mA current source at GATE pin. At this time, the 
OVLO pin voltage is higher than 2.5V, the internal 19µA 
current source is turned on, and the VOVLO is decreased 
to provide threshold hysteresis. Please refer to the 
application and implementation to calculate the 
resistance value of R1 ~ R4 to program the threshold.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued)
Power Good Pin 
The PG pin remains high during the turn-on period until 
the VIN increases above ≊ 1V. At this time, as VIN 
increases, PG continues to pull low. When the VOUT 
increases to within 1.4V of the SENSE pin voltage, (VDS 
< 1.4V), PG is switched high. If VDS of M1 increases 
above 2.8V, PG switches low. PG requires a pull-up 
resistor and the pull-up voltage (VPG) may be as high as 
70V for transient capability up to 80V. If PG requires a 
delay, please refer to Figure 3. Capacitor CPG adds a 
delay to the rising edge in Figure 3 (1). The slew rate of 
the rising edge is determined by RPG1 + RPG2 and CPG, 
and the slew rate of the falling edge is determined by 
RPG2 and CPG in Figure 3 (2). Add a diode as shown in 
Figure 3 (3) to achieve an equal slope of rising edge 
and falling edge. For most applications, the typical 
values in Figure 3 (2) are recommended: RPG1 = 100kΩ, 
RPG2 = 0Ω, CPG = 1μF.

Figure 3. Adding Delay to the Power Good Output Pin 
The SGM25701 has a power-up sequence that can be 
divided into 3 distinct parts: insertion time, inrush limit 
and normal operation. Once in normal operation, the 
TIMER and GATE pins depend on whether the output 
has a fault condition. 
 
Power-Up Sequence 
The SGM25701 has an input voltage range of 9V to 
70V, and the transient input can reach 80V. Please 
refer to Figure 4 for details of this section. When the 
input voltage begins to increase, a strong pull-down 
85mA current source inside the GATE pin prevents the 
Miller capacitance of the MOSFET from being charged. 
Furthermore, the TIMER pin is pulled low until the VIN 
reaches the PORIT threshold. At this time, between 
insertions, the CTIMER begins to be charged by the 
internal 5μA current source when the M1 is still turned 
off by the internal 2.1mA current source without being 
affected by VIN. VIN is allowed to stabilize gradually 
during the insertion time. When the voltage of the 
TIMER pin reaches 4V, the insertion time is over, and 
the charge on the CTIMER is quickly discharged by the 
internal 1.6mA current source. After the insertion time, 
when the VIN reaches the power-on reset threshold 
(POREN), the control circuit is enabled. If the input 
voltage exceeds the under-voltage lockout threshold, 
the 16μA current source inside the GATE pin starts to 
work and turns on M1, and the VGS of M1 is limited to 
12.7V by the internal Zener diode. When the OUT pin 
voltage increases, the SGM25701 detects the drain 
current and power dissipation of the M1, and enables 
the current limit circuit and power-limiting circuit. During 
the inrush limit period, the CTIMER is charged by the 
internal 95μA current source at the TIMER pin. If the 
power dissipation on M1 and the input current decrease 
below their respective limit thresholds before the CTIMER 
voltage value reaches 4V, the 95μA current source is 
turned off and the charge of the CTIMER is discharged by 
the internal 2.4μA current sink. 
When the OUT pin voltage increases to within 1.4V of 
the input voltage, the current limit interval is completed 
and the PG pin is pulled high. If the voltage of TIMER 
pin reaches 4V before the current limit or power-limiting 
ceases, the TIMER pin will be enabled and the GATE 
pin of M1 will be pulled low by the internal 2.1mA 
current source and shut down until the next power-up 
sequence starts or the restart sequence ends.

Gate Control 
An internal charge pump can provide an internal bias 
higher than the output voltage to boost the gate of the 
N-MOSFET. The VGS of M1 is limited to 12.7V by an 
internal Zener diode. During normal operation (see 
Figure 4), the GATE pin is charged to approximately 
12.7V above the OUT pin by the internal 16μA current 
source. If the maximum gate-source voltage of the 
external N-MOSFET is less than 12.7V, a low voltage 
Zener diode with a forward current of at least 100mA 
must be added outside the device. A strong pull-down 
current source of 85mA for the initial operation of the 
device can prevent M1 from being mis-turned through 
the drain-to-gate capacitance. 
When the system is initially powered up, the GATE pin 
is pulled low by an internal 85mA current source to 
prevent misleading MOSFET on through the drain-gate 
capacitance. The GATE pin is pulled low by a 2.1mA 
current source in insertion time (see Figure 4) while the 
MOSFET is always turned off. During the following 
inrush limit time (see Figure 4), the voltage of the GATE 
pin 
is 
limited 
to 
the 
programmed 
current 
or 
power-limiting level when the TIMER pin is charged by 
the 95μA current source. If SGM25701 exits current 
limit or power-limiting state before the TIMER pin is 
charged to 4V, the circuit will enter normal operating 
mode and the TIMER will be discharged by the internal 
2.4μA current. When the TIMER pin is charged to 4V, 
and the device is still in current limit or power-limiting 
state, the load cannot be started properly. The GATE 
will continue to be pulled down by the 2.1mA until the 
end of the restart sequence (SGM25701A) or the start 
sequence initialization (SGM25701B). The GATE pin is 
also pulled down by the 2.1mA current source when the 
supply voltage is lower than EN/UVLO threshold 
voltage or above OVLO threshold voltage. Please refer 
to Figure 5 for the detailed structure.

Fault Timer and Restart 
When the current limit or power-limiting value is 
reached during the startup process, the GATE pin 
voltage is limited to regulate the load current and power 
dissipation. Then a 95μA current source will charge the 
TIMER, please refer to the Figure 8. If the current or 
power-limiting situation fades before the TIMER pin is 
charged to 4V, the device enters normal operation 
mode. Otherwise, the GATE pin of M1 will be 
continuously pulled low by the 2.1mA current source. 
The TIMER pin is discharged by the 2.4μA current sink 
and enters a restart sequence of repeated charge and 
discharge (SGM25701A). After seven failure timeout 
cycles, the restart sequence ends when the voltage of 
the eighth descent ramp of the TIMER pin drops below 
0.3V, and the 16μA current source of the GATE pin 
turns on M1. If the fault persists, the restart sequence 
will be repeated. 
The SGM25701B will latch the fault status after the fault 
detection timeout. The CTIMER is discharged by a 2.4μA 
current sink. The GATE pin is pulled low by a 2.1mA 
current source until the power-up sequence is reset by 
cycling the input voltage, or the UVLO pin is 
momentarily pulled below 2.5V by a control signal, as 
shown in Figure 7. The voltage of the TIMER pin must 
be less than 0.3V to restart effectively.

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
The SGM25701 is a hot swap controller used for fault 
case protections and inrush current management. 
Consider 
startup, 
hot-short 
and 
start-into-short 
scenarios in detail before proceeding with applications. 
In addition, for the safety of the equipment and systems, 
please carefully review the SOA (safe operating area) 
section of the choice of MOSFET. It is recommended to 
use the SGM25701 design calculator provided in the 
datasheet. The following design cases and calculation 
formulas can be used for reference.

Design Requirements 
Table 1 lists the necessary parameters which are 
needed to know before designing. The power 
dissipation of the hot swap MOSFET during startup is 
stored in the output capacitor. Therefore, the VIN and 
COUT value determine the stress of the MOSFET. The 
selection of sense resistor is determined by the 
maximum operating load current. Additionally, the 
maximum operating load current, ambient temperature, 
and thermal characteristics of the PCB (RθCA), all affect 
the RDSON requirements and the number of power 
MOSFETs used. The RθCA value is extremely sensitive 
to copper area and PCB layout. Note that the drain is 
not electrically grounded, so the ground plane does not 
help dissipate heat. The following example uses a 
value of 30℃/W, which is similar to SGM25701 EVB. 
The test conditions for hot swap are needed to know 
before the test. The design must ensure that the 
MOSFET is safe even if the output is shorted. It is 
recommended not to carry the load until the MOSFET 
is successfully started. Loading the MOSFET too early 
may cause the startup failure.

Detailed Design Procedure 
Select RSENSE and CL Setting 
The device measures real-time current by monitoring 
the voltage across the RSENSE. When the voltage across 
RSENSE exceeds 55mV, the GATE pin is pulled low. Note 
the power and size of the RSENSE and the selected 
over-current value. Use Equation 1 to calculate the 
appropriate sense resistance.

Selecting the Hot Swap MOSFET(s) 
Selecting the right MOSFET for hot swap applications 
is critical. Please ensure that the device meets the 
requirements as below: 
 
The VDS of the MOSFET can withstand the 
maximum input voltage of the system along with 
the ringing introduced during transients. 
 
The SOA of the MOSFET can meet the following 
scenarios: startup, hot-short, and start-into-short. 
 
Try to keep the RDSON as small as possible to avoid 
excessive temperature rise. It recommends a 
steady state of less than +125℃ for MOSFETs. 
 
The maximum continuous current must be greater 
than the maximum load current, and the drain 
pulse current must be greater than the threshold 
current of the circuit breaker. 
 
For the design, the KNB2710A is selected. The 
maximum steady state case temperature can be 
calculated as Equation 2 after selecting the MOSFET.

Select Power-Limiting 
It is usually best to use power-limiting to reduce stress 
on the MOSFET. However, when the power-limiting is 
set very low and the current flowing through the 
MOSFET is controlled, the voltage across the RSENSE 
will very low. Equation 5 can be used to calculate the 
voltage across the RSENSE.

Please ensure that the fault timer has enough time to 
ensure that it does not time out in the power-limiting or

Please note that the time calculated above is the ideal 
constant power conversion to constant current startup. 
Because power-limiting is a function of VDS, the actual 
startup time will be longer than calculated time. In 
addition, it needs to consider errors introduced by some 
device specifications, such as CTIMER and constant 
current source, power-limiting value, etc., and also 
needs an additional 50% time margin to ensure that the 
startup time does not time out. Therefore, use Equation 
11 to determine the value of the fault timer capacitance.

If the system has not started successfully beyond this 
time, the SGM25701 will shut down the KNB2710A 
MOSFET. 
Check MOSFET SOA 
Once the power-limiting and timer capacitance values 
are selected, it is important to confirm the SOA 
characteristics of the MOSFET. SOA characteristics 
describe how long a MOSFET can safely operate at a 
certain current under a VDS. In the worst case, the 
MOSFET operates in a power-limiting state all the time. 
The current flowing value is PLIM/VIN,MAX and the 
duration is tFLT. Taking this application as an example, it 
must ensure that the MOSFET may handle 1A at 48V 
for 28.9ms. Based on the SOA of the KNB2710A, it can 
handle 48V, 19A for 1ms and it can handle 48V, 5A for 
100ms. Refer to Equations 13 to 15 to calculate the 
corresponding safe working period.

Note that the current calculated above is an ideal 
calculation considering the MOSFET case temperature 
to be +25 ℃. A certain ambient temperature and 
thermal increase during operation can make the 
MOSFET more possible to hot-short. It can use

Based on this calculation, the MOSFET can handle 
3.21A, 48V for 28.9ms at elevated case temperature. 
This value is larger than the 1.29A required for 
power-limiting startup, indicating that there is little risk 
of hot-short to the MOSFET during startup. It is 
recommended that the selected MOSFET may 
calculate an equivalent current value that exceeds the 
required value by 1.3× to provide sufficient margin.

Set Under-Voltage and Over-Voltage Threshold 
By setting the EN/UVLO and OVLO thresholds, 
SGM25701 turns on the main power MOSFET M1 when 
the input voltage is within the normal operating range. 
Conversely, M1 switches off, stopping the output 
current.  
The four thresholds can be accurately calculated using 
the configuration shown in Figure 11.

Input and Output Protection 
The SGM25701 needs to connect voltage clamping 
devices on the input side under hot plug conditions. It is 
necessary to select an appropriate TVS as shown in 
Figure 1. When the hot plug circuit is suddenly pulled 
out of the socket under the load condition, TVS needs 
to suppress the voltage surge at this time. The principle 
of TVS selection is that there is a small leakage current 
at VIN(MAX), and it is clamped below the set voltage when 
the input surge voltage is large.

Table 2 provides the selected device values under the

APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued) 
Power Supply Recommendations 
Generally speaking, SGM25701 can provide stable 
power supply with reliable performance. However, 
when other card slots on the backplane are inserted, 
the high frequency dynamics on the backplane will 
appear. When this happens in the system, it is 
recommended to place a capacitor of 1μF on the drain 
of MOSFET. This will reduce the common mode 
voltage between VIN and SENSE pins, which needs to 
be suppressed to prevent over-current shutdown. 
 
PC Board Guidelines 
SGM25701 should observe the following principles 
when laying PCB: 
SGM25701 needs to be placed near the input 
connector to reduce the lead inductance from the 
connector to the power MOSFET. 
The bypass capacitor of VIN should be placed carefully. 
When MOSFET is turned off due to short-circuit, the 
input terminal has a very large dV/dt. When the 
capacitor is placed close to the VIN pin, the LC filter is 
formed due to the long routing from SENSE to VIN. At 
this time, a large voltage difference may be formed 
between VIN and SENSE. To prevent this, place the 
capacitor on the RSENSE terminal instead of VIN 
terminal.

 
The RSENSE needs to be close to the controller chip 
and use the Kelvin connection. 
 
The current path and return path from the input to 
the load side should be parallel and close to each 
other to reduce the loop inductance. 
 
GND of components around SGM25701 can be 
connected with each other and connected with 
GND pin of SGM25701. Then connect GND to the 
system ground uniformly. Do not separately 
connect the ground of the devices around the chip 
to the ground of the system with high current. 
 
PCB layout provides good heat dissipation 
conditions for MOSFET M1 to reduce the junction 
temperature when it is turned on and off. 
 
System Considerations 
As shown in Figure 13, the normal operation of 
SGM25701 requires a capacitor on the backplane side. 
The capacitor with live backplane needs to absorb the 
input surge voltage generated when the controller cuts 
off the load. If there is no capacitance, TVS needs to be 
placed in the input measurement to prevent large 
voltage generated during voltage transient from 
exceeding the maximum rated value of VIN pin. 
When the output of SGM25701 is inductive load, it is 
necessary to reverse parallel diode on the load side. 
When the load is cut off, a reverse path is provided for 
the current of the inductive load to prevent negative 
voltage from damaging the device.
