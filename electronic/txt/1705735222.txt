GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM7300B is a differential 2-channel switch which 
can be used for both multiplexer (MUX) and demultiplexer 
(DEMUX) configurations. The device can be used for PCI 
Express Generation 3, USB 3.1 and other high-speed 
serial interface applications. 
The product can switch dual differential signals to 1 of 2 
locations. Using these design techniques, SGMICRO 
minimizes the impedance of the switch so that the 
attenuation observed through the switch can be ignored 
and minimizes the inter-channel skew and inter-channel 
crosstalk required for high-speed serial interfaces. The 
SGM7300B 
can 
achieve 
extremely 
low 
power 
consumption by extending existing high-speed ports. In 
order to achieve high ESD tolerance, the ESD 
protection circuits are integrated into ICs. 
SGMICRO optimizes the pins to match the product to 
different application layouts. The SGM7300B is suitable 
for edge connectors with different signal sources on the 
motherboard, with input and output pins on opposite 
sides of the package. 
No external DC blocking capacitors are required on the 
RF paths as long as no external DC voltage is applied, 
which can save PCB area and cost. 
The SGM7300B is available in a Green TLGA-2.5×4.5 
-20L package.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.
