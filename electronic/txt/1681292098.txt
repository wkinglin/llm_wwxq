OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
The AC and DC characteristics of SGM5532L are 
excellent since it is a high-performance amplifier. There 
are a lot of advantages for the device: high output 
current, high slew rate, high bandwidth for maximum 
output swing condition, low output noise and distortion. 
The device also provides ESD diodes to protect the 
input and has output short-circuit protection. The 
SGM5532L is unity-gain stable. 
 
Unity-Gain Bandwidth 
The definition of unity-gain bandwidth is the maximum 
supported frequency which can be amplified by an 
amplifier without distortion. The unity-gain bandwidth of 
SGM5532L is 9.5MHz. 
 
Common Mode Rejection Ratio 
The common mode rejection ratio illustrates the ability 
of an amplifier to reject the unwanted input common 
mode signal. It is defined by the ratio between the 
change of the input common mode voltage and the 
change of the input offset voltage in decibels. The 
CMRR of SGM5532L is 140dB. 
 
Slew Rate 
The slew rate is the time period for the output change 
when input signal is changed. The slew rate of 
SGM5532L is 18V/μs. 
 
Device Functional Modes 
The SGM5532L can be operated as it is powered by a 
DC power supply. The amplifier can be operated in 
single-supply or dual-supply mode.

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
The differential output is required in some specific 
applications. The following circuit in Figure 1 can 
convert the 2V to 10V single-ended input signal to ±8V 
output. In order to maximize the linearity of the circuit, 
the output is limited intentionally. There are two 
amplifiers in the circuit: the Amplifier A is a buffer and 
provides VOUT+, the Amplifier B provides VOUT- from an 
inverting input and a reference voltage. The range of 
VOUT+ and VOUT- is from 2V to 10V so that the VDIFF 
(VOUT+ - VOUT-) is ranged from ±8V.

Output Conversion 
 
Detailed Design Procedure 
The VOUT+ and VOUT- of the circuit are generated by the 
amplified VIN and VREF. VOUT+ is connected directly to 
the buffered VIN so that the relationship is shown in 
Equation 1. VOUT- is the output of the Amplifier B, which 
is obtained by adding a reference and amplified the 
buffered VIN. The relationship among VOUT-, VIN and 
VREF are shown in Equation 2.

The VDIFF is the difference between two single-ended 
outputs, VOUT+ and VOUT-. The transfer function between 
the VDIFF and VIN is shown in Equation 3. For 
simplification, if R1 = R2 and R3 = R4, the signal gain of 
the Amplifier B is one and the corresponding equation 
is shown in Equation 6. On the conditions of R1 = R2 
and R3 = R4, the transfer function can be simply given 
by Equation 6. For normal operation, the maximum 
value of VIN and each output of the amplifier are equal 
to VREF, which means that the maximum value of the 
VDIFF is equal to 2VREF. Moreover, the common mode 
output voltage is equal to VREF/2, as shown in Equation 
7.

Amplifier Selection 
For DC accuracy, the linearity of the amplifier should be 
taken into consideration. Also, the maximum output 
swing and the input common mode range are the 
determination of the linearity, which means that a 
rail-to-rail amplifier is necessary for the application. On 
the other hand, the bandwidth should be also taken into 
account. Because the unity-gain bandwidth of the 
SGM5532L is 9.5MHz, the circuit can work only for an 
input signal less than 9.5MHz. 
 
Passive Component Selection 
The transfer function of VOUT- is related to the tolerance 
of the selected resistors, which means that the selected 
resistors should be kept as less tolerance as possible. 
For the following design, the selected resistors are 
36kΩ with less than 2% tolerance. For those users who 
care about the noise of the system, the smaller 
resistance can be taken into account to make sure that 
the resistor noise is smaller than that of the amplifier. 
 
Power Supply Recommendations 
The power supply range for SGM5532L is from ±2.5V 
to ±18V. Once the power supply voltage exceeds the 
±18V range, the device will be permanently damaged. 
For noisy power supply conditions, a 100nF bypass 
capacitor should be placed close to the power supply 
pin to reduce any error coupling. Furthermore, the 
Layout Guidelines section provides more information 
about the bypass capacitor.

Layout 
Layout Guidelines 
The following layout suggestions should be considered 
for good performance: 
• Noise from the power supply is propagated through 
the amplifier and degrades the performance of the 
corresponding circuit. A bypass capacitor is necessary 
for reducing the influence of the noise and providing a 
low-impedance path for the noise component. 
• A 100nF low ESR, ceramic bypass capacitor should 
be placed as close as possible to the power supply pin 
of SGM5532L. For the single-supply applications, the 
bypass capacitor should be placed between +VS and 
GND. 
• For decreasing the influence of the noise, the analog 
and digital ground should be separated. The GND 
planes are usually used in the application of multi-layer 
layout, which can reduce the EMI and noise pickup. 
The analog and digital ground should be separated 
physically, and the direction of the ground current 
should be also taken into consideration. 
• The distance between the input traces and the power 
supply traces should be maximized to reduce the 
parasitic coupling. However, if the sensitive traces are 
impossible to be kept away from the noisy trace, place 
them perpendicular to the noisy traces. 
• The external devices (resistors or capacitors) should 
be kept as close as possible to the SGM5532L. To 
minimize the impact of parasitic capacitance, the RF 
and RG should be placed as close as possible to the 
inverting input pin, as shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3. 
• For PCB layout, the input traces should be designed 
as short as possible to avoid any parasitic capacitor as 
the input trace is the most sensitive part. 
• The low-impedance guard ring could be taken into 
account around the critical traces of the circuit, which 
can decrease the leakage currents from the nearby 
traces.
