GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM8429C-4 is a quad operational amplifier with 
internal frequency compensation. It is optimized for high 
voltage operation from 3V to 32V single supply or ±1.5V 
to ±16V dual supplies, and consumes only 860μA 
quiescent current. 
The SGM8429C-4 features low power, low offset voltage 
and low bias current. The device can offer high 
open-loop voltage gain. It is well suited for various 
applications. 
The SGM8429C-4 is available in a Green TQFN-3×3-16L 
package. It is specified over the -40℃ to +125℃ 
temperature range.

NOTES: 
1. The network GND is the reference point for all voltage values, 
except for differential voltages and VS when measuring ISC. 
2. Differential voltage is between +IN and -IN. 
 
OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
The SGM8429C-4 is a quad, high open-loop gain 
operational amplifier with internal frequency compensation. 
It is optimized for high voltage operation from 3V to 32V 
single supply or ±1.5V to ±16V dual supplies. The input 
common mode voltage range is from -0.1V to (+VS) - 
1.5V. 
This SGM8429C-4 makes it easier to implement all 
conventional 
operational 
amplifier 
circuits 
in 
a 
single-supply system, such as DC amplifier modules and 
transducer amplifiers. For instance, the device does not 
need extra ±5V supplies to work with the interface 
electronics, as it can be easily operated on the 5V 
source that is common for digital systems.  
 
Unity-Gain Bandwidth 
The unity-gain bandwidth is the maximum supported 
frequency which can be amplified by an amplifier without 
distortion. The unity-gain bandwidth of SGM8429C-4 is 
1.1MHz. 
Slew Rate 
The slew rate is the time period for the output change 
when input signal is changed. The slew rate of 
SGM8429C-4 is 0.35V/μs. 
 
Input Common Mode Voltage Range 
The input common mode voltage range is from the 
device ground to (+VS) - 1.5V. Also, the voltage level at 
the inputs can reach VS without damaging the device. If 
the users desire the correct phase at the output of the 
operational amplifier, they need to make sure that at 
least one of the inputs is within the input common mode 
voltage range. If both of them are outside the input 
common mode voltage range, the state of the output 
will be undefined. However, if either input is below -0.3V, 
the input current should be limited and the output state 
will also be undefined. 
 
Device Functional Modes 
The SGM8429C-4 can be operated as it is powered by 
a DC power supply. The amplifier can be operated in 
single-supply or dual-supply mode. 
 
 
APPLICATION INFORMATION 
The SGM8429C-4 can be widely used for various 
signal processing purposes. The inputs have the option 
to get power before VS, which allows for more versatility 
in circuits with multiple supplies. 
 
Typical Application 
The following circuit is an application of an inverting 
amplifier. To explain, the input is positive while the output 
is negative. However, if the input signal is negative, the 
output will be positive as well. 
 
 
 
Figure 1. Application Schematic 
The supply voltage range should always be larger than 
the input and the output range. The following example 
scales a signal with ±0.5V to ±1.8V, which means that 
the ±12V of the supply voltage is sufficient. 
The following equations determine the voltage gain of 
the inverting amplifier circuit.

After setting the voltage gain, the value of the gain and 
feedback resistors should be determined as well. Since 
the operating current inside the circuit is in the mA 
range, the RI and RF should be at the level of kΩ. In this 
example, the RI is 10kΩ and the RF is 36kΩ.
