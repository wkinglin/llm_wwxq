GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM3112 is a switched capacitor converter with 
low noise output voltage. The SGM3112 is capable of 
delivering 200mA output current at 5V output from 3.1V 
to 5.5V input voltage range. The available output 
current is 125mA when the input voltage reaches 2.7V. 
In the case of small output current, SGM3112 operates 
in PFM mode to reduce power loss. The PFM mode 
can be configured by pulling MODE pin to logic high. In 
addition, by pulling the OUTDIS pin to logic high, the 
device will discharge the output voltage when the 
device is disabled. 
The SGM3112 is available in a Green TDFN-2×2-8AL 
package. It offers excellent thermal performance which 
prevents the device from overheating under rated 
operating conditions.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
Overview 
The SGM3112 is a fully integrated switched-cap Boost 
converter which is capable of providing a stable output 
voltage from various input sources such as single-cell 
Li-Ion battery or 2-cell or 3-cell alkaline battery. The 
output 
voltage 
is 
regulated 
via 
a 
two-phase 
non-overlapping clock which controls the output of the 
converter. When the device is enabled, during phase 1 
(φ1), the flying capacitor is charged to the input voltage 
through internal switches S1 and S2, and during phase 
2 (φ2), the flying capacitor is connected between the 
input and output via internal switches S3 and S4. The 
charge of the flying capacitor boosts the output voltage 
on top of the input voltage to supply the load demand of 
the output. 
The 50% duty operation of the internal switch-cap 
boosts the input voltage to twice the input voltage. 
Output voltage regulation is achieved by modulating the 
current of the S2 and S3 in each phase connected to 
the VIN pin. 
 
Input Feed-Forward 
The internal architecture of the SGM3112 consists of 
four switches and an external flying capacitor. Output 
voltage regulation is achieved by controlling the current 
through the two switches connected to the VIN pin, one 
switch in each phase which results in that the output 
regulation is achieved before the voltage doubling, thus 
achieving VIN feed-forward. This control method 
effectively removes the undesirable input current ripple 
that is common on many switched capacitor devices. 
 
Input Current Limit 
The SGM3112 implements internal current limit to 
protect the device against over current or output short 
to ground scenarios. In the case of output short to 
ground, the input current is limited to 630mA (TYP). 
During output short condition, higher power dissipation 
is expected which will cause the device to enter 
over-temperature cycle. 
 
Pulse Frequency Modulation (PFM) Mode 
By pulling the MODE pin to logic high, PFM mode is 
enabled. In PFM mode, power consumption is reduced 
by varying the switching frequency based on the load, 
where the switching is initiated when the output voltage 
drops below 5V. In no load condition, the switching 
frequency could drop below 1kHz to maintain output 
voltage regulation. 
By pulling the MODE pin to logic low, fixed frequency is 
configured. Power consumption is increased in this 
setting. However, this setting offers various advantages 
such as fixed switching frequency and lower output 
ripple, which are beneficial for noise sensitive 
applications. 
 
Output Discharge 
When the device is disabled by pulling the EN pin to 
logic low, there are two ways to control the output 
voltage via the OUTDIS pin. Pulling the OUTDIS pin to 
logic high, the SGM3112 automatically pulls the output 
to GND for fast discharge, where the output pin sinks 
540µA (TYP). Pulling the OUTDIS pin to logic low, the 
SGM3112 does not actively discharge the output, and 
the output voltage slowly reduces to zero when the EN 
pin is pulled to logic low, where the output pin 
consumes only 2.5µA (TYP). 
 
Thermal Shutdown 
The thermal shutdown circuit is integrated inside the 
SGM3112 to prevent the device from damaging due to 
overheating. When the junction temperature is greater 
than +150℃ (TYP), the chip performs thermal shutdown. 
The chip restarts when the junction temperature falls 
below +130℃ (TYP). 
 
Under-Voltage Lockout 
The SGM3112 implements under-voltage lockout on 
the VIN pin. The device is enabled when the input 
voltage is higher than 2.61V (TYP), and stops operation 
when the input voltage drops below 2.40V (TYP). 
 
Shutdown 
Pulling the EN pin to logic low or removing VIN will shut 
down the SGM3112. In the shutdown state, the 
SGM3112 only consumes 1µA (MAX) shutdown current 
from the input. 
 
Boost Mode 
When the input voltage is above the 2.61V (TYP) UVLO 
rising threshold, and EN pin is logic high, the device 
operates in Boost mode to regulate the output voltage. 
According to the configuration of the MODE pin, the 
SGM3112 works in either PFM mode or fixed frequency 
mode.

Detailed Design Procedure 
Output Current Capability 
The SGM3112 is capable of delivering up to 200mA 
load current when the input voltage is higher than 3.1V. 
The maximum output current is 125mA when the input 
voltage operates from 2.7V to 3.1V. 
Figure 4 is a simplified drawing of the voltage doubler 
architecture, which consists of a pre-regulation block, a 
voltage doubler block, and an equivalent output 
resistance which is used to estimate the output voltage 
drop in open loop operation. 
The equivalent output resistance is approximately 3.8Ω 
at VIN = 2.7V, which is approximately twice the internal 
resistance of the four switches. Under normal operation, 
the device regulates the V’ voltage to ensure the output 
voltage is 5V ± 3%. Increasing the load current causes 
the voltage drop on ROUT increases, the SGM3112 
adjusts the V’ voltage to ensure the output voltage is 
within 5V regulation. When the voltage drop on ROUT 
results in zero voltage drop on the regulator, V’ voltage 
is equal to the input voltage. When this occurs, the 
SGM3112 is on the edge of out of regulation. As the 
load current increases further, the output voltage will 
decrease. Use Equation below to calculate the output 
voltage in out of regulation state.

RSW resistance of 3Ω is the main contributor to the 
output resistance. The switching frequency and flying 
capacitor CFLY only contribute 0.5Ω. Increasing the size 
of the flying capacitor improves the output current 
capability. However, careful design to balance the 
needed load current and flying capacitor size is 
necessary. If the selected output capacitor is ceramic 
capacitor, the ESR is not significant and can be 
neglected.

The highest power dissipation occurs at maximum VIN 
and maximum load current, which is 5.5V/200mA, 
equivalent of 1.2W loss. Care should be taken when 
the operating condition is near the worst-case power 
dissipation where the device might enter thermal 
protection.

Output Capacitor and Output Voltage Ripple 
The output capacitor affects the output voltage ripple, 
while input voltage, load current, and flying capacitance 
also contribute to the output voltage ripple. Larger 
output capacitance results in lower output voltage ripple. 
In φ1 operation, the output capacitor supplies the 
current to the load. Use Equation below to estimate the 
output ripple, where the time of discharge is half the 
switching period.

         (6) 
The two operating phases’ non-overlapping time and 
output capacitor ESR play significant role to the output 
voltage ripple. For proper operation, the two operating 
phases should not overlap. While the overlap occurs, 
all internal switches are turned off immediately. The 
SGM3112 has built-in mechanism on the internal clock 
to prevent the overlap from occurring. During the 
non-overlapping time, all switches are turned off, thus 
no energy is delivered to the output, and this period 
contributes to the output ripple. Use Equation below to 
calculate the overlap ripple, where the output capacitor 
discharge time is approximately 60% of the switching 
period.

 (7) 
In general, a 10μF ceramic capacitor with 10V rating is 
recommended for the SGM3112. When PFM mode is 
enabled, and a small output capacitor is used, the 
output ripple increases during the transition between 
PFM mode and fixed frequency mode. DC bias 
derating should be evaluated when using ceramic 
capacitor. 
Ceramic capacitors have small ESR in general. 
However, electrolytic capacitor or tantalum capacitor 
has larger ESR which will contribute to higher output 
ripple. A parallel combination of ceramic capacitor is 
recommended to reduce the effective ESR. 
 
Input Capacitor and Input Voltage Ripple 
The input capacitor serves various roles for SGM3112. 
During the charging phase, the input capacitor helps to 
speed up the charging of the flying capacitor. In 
addition, the input capacitor helps to avoid the input 
voltage drop when the flying capacitor is being charged. 
Lastly, the input capacitor serves as decoupling to filter 
out noise on the input line to reduce the input voltage 
ripple. 
A 10μF, 10V or higher voltage rated X5R/X7R low ESR 
ceramic capacitor is recommended for SGM3112. 
 
Flying Capacitor 
A 1μF, 10V rated X5R/X7R low ESR ceramic capacitor 
is recommended for SGM3112. Tantalum or electrolytic 
capacitors must not be used for SGM3112. Since these 
types of capacitors have polarity requirement, these 
types of capacitors could become reverse-biased in 
normal operation. 
 
Layout Guidelines 
Layout is critical to ensure the proper operation and 
performance of the SGM3112. It is recommended to 
place the input, output and flying capacitors as close as 
possible to the device, and on the same side. Use short 
and wide traces to connect these capacitors to the IC is 
also critical to reduce trace parasitic. 
Use multiple GND vias to connect the GND pin and the 
PCB ground plane to improve thermal dissipation 
performance.
