GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM2528 is a compact electronic fuse (eFuse) 
with a complete set of protection functions. The wide 
operating voltage range is specifically designed for 
many popular DC buses. The SGM2528 provides 
excellent accuracy, making it very suitable for many 
system protection applications. 
It provides accurate over-voltage (OV) and under- 
voltage lockout (UVLO) protections, which ensure tight 
supervision of bus voltages and eliminate the need for 
supervisor circuits. The over-voltage (OV) protection 
will clamp the eFuse output at a fixed level during input 
voltage surges. During the input voltage transient, the 
internal FET remains on, which allows the load to 
continue to operate. If the transient duration remains 
long, the accumulated heat will cause the eFuse 
thermal shutdown. Once in thermal shutdown, latch-off 
and auto-retry thermal options are available. 
The SGM2528 is available in a Green TDFN-3×3-10L 
package.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
Basic Operation 
This device is a smart eFuse with enhanced built-in 
protection circuitry. It provides robust protection for all 
systems and applications powered from 9V to 18V. 
For hot plug boards, the device provides inrush current 
control and programmable output ramp rate. The 
SGM2528 integrates over-current and short-circuit 
protections. The precision over-current limit helps 
minimize over design of the input power supply. The 
short-circuit protection with fast response isolates the 
load from input immediately when the short-circuit is 
detected. The device provides precision monitoring of 
bus voltage for brown-out and over-voltage conditions, 
and asserts fault for downstream system. The SGM2528 
is designed to protect systems such as hard disks, 
PCIE SSDs and motherboard systems. 
The input voltage will be limited by the device's internal 
control circuitry and then applied to the load. The slew 
rate of the output voltage is controlled by the internal 
dV/dt circuit. The output voltage will ramp up in 2ms, 
unless additional capacitor is placed at the dV/dt pin to 
slow down the ramp-up rate. 
The device will not shut down unless the temperature 
exceeds the factory-set shutdown threshold. When 
entering current limit mode, the device will not be shut 
down, but the FET current will be limited to the value 
set by the ILIMIT pin. When entering input over-voltage 
clamp mode, the device will also not be shut down, but 
the output voltage will be limited to 15V even the input 
voltage is larger. 
 
Current Limit 
The current mirror structure is applied to limit the peak 
current of the device, which measures a small fraction 
of the load current, so that the loss made by the 
sensing resistor is reduced. In addition, current mirror 
structure also reduces the cost of the sensing resistor.

APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued) 
The current limit circuit has two limit levels: a lower 
current limit level will be triggered by the excessive load 
where the gate voltage is high and the FET is fully on. A 
higher current limit level will be triggered by a short- 
circuit event, where the device is actively limiting the 
current and the gate voltage is at an intermediate level. 
There are two methods to bias the ILIMIT pin with a 
sensing resistor (RLIMIT). They are shown in Figure 1 
and Figure 2. 
For the direct current sensing method, since the 
sensing resistor is placed between the ILIMIT pin and the 
load, the bond wire resistance is inevitably included in 
the current limit circuit. This resistor not only affects the 
current limit accuracy, but may also vary slightly as the 
impedance between the sensing resistor and the 
SOURCE pin changes. Considering that the 5 
SOURCE 
pins 
are 
connected 
in 
parallel, 
the 
on-resistance of the device will be slightly reduced, and 
the bond wire resistance of this pin is also one fifth of 
the other pins. 
For the Kelvin current sensing method, the sensing 
resistor is placed between the ILIMIT pin and one of the 
SOURCE pins. Since the current limit circuit senses the 
voltage on the die, any bond wire resistance as well as 
external impedance will not affect the current limit 
levels. Compared with direct current sensing, this 
method has only four SOURCE pins for power, which 
will make the on-resistance slightly larger. 
 
Over-Voltage Clamp (SGM2528A and 
SGM2528B) 
The over-voltage clamp circuit monitors the output 
voltage. If the input voltage is larger than 15V, the 
device will regulate the main integrated FET to make 
the output voltage limited to 15V. This can not only 
ensure the continuity of the device during transient 
operation, but also protect the load. If the over-voltage 
event lasts for a long time, the power consumption of 
the main FET may overheat the device, then trigger the 
thermal protection circuit which will turn off the device. 
 
Under-Voltage Lockout 
The under-voltage lockout circuit monitors the input 
voltage via a comparator with hysteresis. In its high 
state, the internal output switch is enabled. A low level 
on this pin will turn off the output switch.  
 
dV/dt Circuit 
The SGM2528 is designed to control the inrush current 
during hot plugging. This limits the voltage sag on the 
backplane 
power 
supply 
voltage 
and 
prevents 
unintended resets of the system power supply. A slew 
rate controlled startup (dV/dt) regardless of the load is 
realized by the internal circuit, which generates a fixed 
slope ramp signal. The rising slope of the output 
voltage is determined by this ramp and the scaling 
factor. 
If the dV/dt pin is left open, the output voltage ramps up 
in approximately 2ms. By connecting an external 
capacitor from this pin to ground, the user can get a 
longer output ramp-up time. There is a constant current 
source of about 100nA inside the dV/dt pin. 
Considering the low current level of the current source, 
it is recommended to connect a ceramic capacitor or a 
low leakage capacitor to the dV/dt pin if necessary, and 
external electrolytic capacitors are not recommended 
for this pin. 
The total ramp time (t0-12) of output voltage for 0V to 
12V can be calculated using the following equations: 
t0-12 = 25.5e6 (5pF + CEXT)            (1) 
0-12
EXT
t
C
 = 
 - 5pF
25.5e6
              (2)
 
where: 
CEXT is in Farads. 
t is in seconds. 
If the device is turned off due to a fault, disable or input 
power recycling, the output voltage will ramp up from 
0V via the timing capacitor being discharging when it is 
turned back on.

The ENABLE/FAULT not only controls the on/off state 
of the internal FET, but also indicates whether the 
device is shut down due to thermal protection, so it is a 
multifunctional, bidirectional pin. The output of the 
device turns on when the ENABLE/FAULT is high and 
vice versa. 
Considering the 3-state operation of this pin, it should 
be connected to an open drain or open collector circuit 
instead of a circuit with a pull-up structure. 
As shown in Figure 5, if the device triggers thermal 
protection and shuts down, the ENABLE/FAULT pin will 
be pulled down to logic medium level (1.45V, TYP). The 
voltage signal at this pin can be monitored by an 
external circuit to obtain information on whether thermal 
shutdown of the device has occurred. If this pin shares 
an external open drain or open collector circuit with 
another device in the family like Figure 3 shows, a 
thermal shutdown failure of either device will cause 
both devices to shut down. 
There are two ways to enable the output of latched 
thermal devices, either by pulling the ENABLE/FAULT 
pin to ground through an external switch and then going 
high, or when the input power is recycled. For 
auto-retry devices, as long as the die temperature of 
the device in the shutdown state is below the 
temperature threshold, both devices will restart. 
 
Thermal Shutdown 
The SGM2528 integrates a temperature sensing circuit 
for sensing the die temperature on the power FET. If 
the temperature exceeds the temperature threshold 
(158℃), the device enters thermal shutdown mode and 
the load is powered down. For latched thermal devices, 
the output will be enabled in two ways: recycling the 
input or toggling the ENABLE/FAULT pin. For auto-retry 
devices, as long as the die temperature drops by more 
than 22℃, the output will be enabled and the load will 
power up again. 
To increase the device trip time during transient events 
at high power conditions, the thermal shutdown 
temperature threshold is set high. Therefore, it is not 
recommended to allow this device to work for a long 
time in a working condition above +125℃.
