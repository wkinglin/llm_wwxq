DECEMBER 2022 – REV.A.1 
 
GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM72108 is a single-pole/eight-throw (SP8T) 
antenna switch, which supports from 0.1GHz to 3.0GHz. 
The device features low insertion loss and high 
isolation, which make it suitable for high linearity 
receiving applications. It also has the advantage of high 
linearity performance. The SGM72108 is not subject to 
cellular interference and is applied to multi-mode and 
multi-band LTE mobile phones. 
The SGM72108 has the ability to integrate SP8T RF 
switch and MIPI controller on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) 
process. Internal driver and decoder for switch control 
signals are offered by the controller, which makes it 
flexible in RF path band and routing selection. 
No external DC blocking capacitors are required on the 
RF paths as long as no external DC voltage is applied, 
which can save PCB area and cost. 
The SGM72108 is available in a Green UTQFN-2×
2-14AL package.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure 
to 
observe 
proper 
handling 
and 
installation 
procedures can cause damage. ESD damage can range from 
subtle performance degradation to complete device failure. 
Precision integrated circuits may be more susceptible to 
damage because even small parametric changes could 
cause the device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.
