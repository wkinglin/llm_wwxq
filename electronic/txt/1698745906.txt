GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM3752 is an asynchronous Boost WLED driver 
with high efficiency, low EMI and high output voltage. 
The Boost converter integrates a 40V, 1.5A internal 
FET which operates at 1.2MHz switching frequency. Its 
strong driving ability can drive single or multiple parallel 
LED strings, which can be used as LED driver for smart 
phone and tablet backlight. 
The default LED current can be programmed by the 
external current-sense resistor RSET. By varying the 
duty cycle of the PWM signal applied to the CTRL pin, 
the internal reference voltage is adjusted, which 
ultimately adjusts the LED sink current. With full PWM 
duty cycle, the internal reference voltage VREF is 200mV 
(TYP). The SGM3752 is essentially a driver that adopts 
analog dimming control, and it will not produce audible 
noise on the output capacitor. The SGM3752 integrates 
ringing cancellation, and it can effectively reduce EMI 
noise in DCM mode. The SGM3752 provides excellent 
line regulation and load regulation, as well as excellent 
load transient response. The SGM3752 also features 
various protection functions such as open LED 
protection, OCP protection and thermal shutdown 
protection. 
The SGM3752 is available in a Green TSOT-23-6 
package. It operates over an ambient temperature 
range of -40℃ to +85℃.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
The SGM3752 is an asynchronous Boost converter that 
operates at 1.2MHz switching frequency and integrates 
a power FET with peak current limit of 1.5A. The 
maximum output voltage can reach 38V. The device is 
capable of driving LEDs from 1 series to 10 series and 
the input voltage range is 2.7V to 5.5V. The strong 
driving capability of the device can drive single or 
multiple parallel LED strings, which can be used as 
LED driver for smart phone and tablet backlight. 
The SGM3752 operates with peak current control, and 
the internal compensation circuit greatly reduces the 
complexity of the design. The loop design can be 
completed with only one external sampling resistor 
RSET. Peak current mode controls the on time of the 
switching FET by comparing the error signal of the 
internal GM amplifier with the inductance current signal. 
Through the duty cycle of the PWM signal added to the 
CTRL pin, the SGM3752 can set the reference voltage 
VREF. When the duty cycle is 100%/10%/1%, the typical 
values of VREF are 200mV/20.3mV/2.5mV respectively, 
and the supported PWM signal has a wide frequency 
range from 10kHz to 100kHz. It can realize linear 
dimming in the range of PWM duty cycle 0.2% to 100%. 
The SGM3752 also has excellent line regulation and 
load regulation, as well as excellent load transient 
response performance. It also has complete protection 
functions, including open LED protection, OCP 
protection and thermal shutdown protection. At the 
same time, the output current can be programmed 
through the resistor RSET connected to the FB pin. 
 
Soft Start-Up 
SGM3752 integrates the soft start-up function to ensure 
that the output voltage of Boost converter rises slowly 
by limiting the output voltage of GM amplifier during 
start-up. This method effectively avoids the surge 
current. After the start-up is completed, the device 
switches 
to 
the 
internal 
reference 
voltage 
for 
closed-loop control. 
 
Open LED Protection 
Open LED protection feature shuts off the IC in case of 
LED or RSET disconnection, which prevents damage to 
the device. The SGM3752 monitors the voltage of SW 
pin in each switching cycle. When VSW exceeds VOVP 
threshold for 8 consecutive cycles, the device turns the 
switch FET off, and shuts down the IC. The device 
remains in shutdown until the CTRL pin is toggled to 
logic high. This function can effectively prevent the 
device from being damaged when the output voltage 
exceeds VOVP threshold. 
 
Shutdown 
When the CTRL pin remains low voltage for more than 
2.5ms, the SGM3752 enters shutdown mode. In 
shutdown mode, the internal switch FET stops 
switching, and the device maintains in a low loss 
condition. At the same time, the minimum forward 
voltage of the LED array should be kept higher than the 
maximum input voltage. Otherwise a DC current path is 
resulted from the inductor and Schottky diode to the 
LED array. 
 
Current Program 
The FB pin voltage VFB depends on the internal 
reference voltage VREF. At full PWM duty cycle, the 
typical value of VREF is 200mV. The external 
programming of LED current can be realized by using 
the current-sense resistor connected in series with the 
LED. The RSET resistor value is given by Equation 1: 
FB
LED
SET
V
I
R
=
                (1) 
where 
ILED = sum of LED string(s) current 
VFB = FB pin regulation voltage 
RSET = current sense resistor. 
The FB voltage accuracy and current sense resistor 
accuracy determines the output current accuracy. 
 
LED Brightness Dimming 
The PWM signal applied to the CTRL pin controls the 
LED current. For PWM dimming signal, the device 
required PWM frequency range is 10kHz to 100kHz, 
which can obtain accurate reference voltage and small 
LED current ripple. The LED brightness dimming can 
be realized by changing PWM duty cycle. The 
relationship between duty cycle and FB regulation 
voltage is calculated by Equation 2: 
VFB = Duty × 200mV + 0.75mV         (2) 
where 
Duty = duty cycle of the PWM signal 
200mV = internal reference voltage 
0.75mV = most appreciate maximum from production 
statistics

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
The LED brightness is easily adjusted by controlling the 
duty cycle of the PWM signal applied to CTRL pin. The 
recommended minimum PWM duty cycle is 0.1% for no 
blind dimming. 
As shown in Figure 3, the SGM3752 adjusts the 200mV 
reference voltage based on PWM duty cycle of the 
CTRL pin. The PWM reference voltage is then filtered 
by the internal RC filter. The RC filter output is then fed 
to the non-inverting input of the error amplifier. The 
advantage is that the value of the reference voltage 
VREF only depends the duty cycle of the PWM signal 
and does not depend on the amplitude. Under this 
working principle, although the PWM signal is used for 
dimming, its essence is an analog dimming. The PWM 
signal is only used to modulate the reference voltage 
VREF, which can avoid the occurrence of audible noise.

Figure 3. FB Voltage Adjustment via PWM Signal 
 
However, it should be noted that since the reference 
voltage VREF is obtained by the charge and discharge of 
the RC low-pass filter, the VREF has a ripple voltage with 
the same frequency as the PWM signal, which will 
significantly increase the LED ripple current. With the 
increase of PWM signal frequency, the ripple voltage of 
VREF decreases, and the LED ripple current decreases. 
 
Under-Voltage Lockout 
Under-voltage lockout prevents the device from 
operating at input voltage below 2.2V (TYP). When VIN 
falls below 2.2V, the device enters shutdown mode and 
the internal switch FET is turned off. If VIN reaches 2.3V 
(TYP), the IC will resume operation. 
 
Thermal Shutdown 
When the junction temperature of the IC exceeds 160℃
(TYP), the internal thermal shutdown is triggered and 
the device enters the shutdown state. When the 
junction temperature is dropped by 20℃ (TYP), the 
device will restart and resume operation. 
 
Operation with CTRL 
The CTRL pin is an enable control pin with logic high 
voltage of 1.5V and logic low voltage of 0.4V. When the 
control voltage of CTRL pin is higher than 1.5V and the 
input voltage is higher than the UVLO threshold, the 
device starts up. When the control voltage of CTRL pin 
is lower than 0.4V, the device enters shutdown mode 
and the switch FET is turned off.

Inductor Selection 
Inductance is an important power device for Boost 
converter 
design. 
Selecting 
appropriate 
inductor 
parameters can ensure that the system has high 
efficiency and stable steady-state performance. At the 
same time, it will also affect the system transient 
response and loop stability. Inductor’s DC resistance, 
saturation current and inductance are important specs 
for DC/DC design. Large inductance results in small 
ripple current, which is beneficial to smaller output 
ripple voltage and higher transmission efficiency. Use 
Equation 3 to calculate the average inductor current

where

IOUT = Boost output current 
VIN = Boost input voltage 
η = power conversion efficiency. 
 
Use the minimum input voltage, maximum output 
voltage, and maximum load current to calculate the 
worst-case average current. The selected inductor 
should provide a peak to peak ripple current ΔIL(P-P) to 
be 30% to 40% of inductor average DC current IL (DC) 
calculated in Equation 3. Use Equation 4 to calculate 
the peak-to-peak inductor current.

The saturation current value of inductor will affect the 
operation of Boost converter. When the inductor current 
is close to or higher than the saturation current, the 
inductance will drop rapidly, which causes the peak 
inductor current to rise and reach the peak current limit 
of the IC. The selected inductor’s saturation current 
should maintain a 20% margin, and a 4.7μH to 10μH 
inductor is recommended for SGM3752. 
 
Schottky Diode Selection 
In order to ensure the best efficiency of SGM3752, the 
selected Schottky diode should have low forward 
voltage, fast reverse recovery speed, and low junction 
capacitance. At the same time, the average and peak 
current ratings of the selected diode should exceed the 
average output current and peak inductor current. It is 
recommended to have a 20% current margin. 
Additionally, the Schottky diode reverse breakdown 
voltage should be higher than the open LED protection 
voltage threshold to avoid damage. It is recommended 
to use ONSemi NSR0240 for the SGM3752.

Output Capacitor Selection 
The output capacitance of SGM3752 is used to meet 
the loop stability and output ripple requirement. At the 
same time, it affects the loop bandwidth and the 
transient response performance. MLCC capacitor with 
low ESR is recommended as the output capacitor. For 
a given output voltage ripple requirement, the minimum 
output capacitance value can be calculated according 
to Equation 6:

where 
VRIPPLE = peak-to-peak output ripple. 
A 1μF to 10μF MLCC capacitor is recommended for 
typical application. Since the reference voltage VREF is 
obtained by filtering the pulse signal, the actual output 
ripple contains the pulsed ripple, which carries the 
same frequency as the PWM signal. The interference 
ripple can be effectively reduced by using 1μF MLCC 
capacitor. For higher total output current applications, it 
is recommended to use 2.2μF or larger MLCC output 
capacitor to minimize output ripple. 
 
LED Current Set Resistor 
Use Equation 1 to calculate the RSET resistance. 
Multiple resistors can also be connected in parallel to 
obtain the required resistance value. 
 
Thermal Considerations 
Thermal dissipation of the IC should be considered to 
design the SGM3752. High IC junction temperature will 
trigger thermal shutdown. The heat loss is related to the 
system input and output. Lower input voltage and 
higher output current leads to more heat loss. The 
thermal dissipation can be reduced by reasonable 
layout. The allowable heat loss of device can be 
determined by Equation 7:

where 
TA = the ambient temperature for the application. 
θJA = the thermal resistance junction-to-ambient given 
under absolute maximum ratings section. 
 
Power Supply Recommendations 
The SGM3752 operates with an input voltage range of 
2.7V to 5.5V. It is recommended to use 22μF MLCC 
capacitor as the input capacitor. If the SGM3752 is 
located far away from the input power supply, an 
additional high-capacity capacitor is recommended to 
damp the wiring inductance. 
 
EMI Precaution and Ringing Cancelling 
Careful layout, routing and selection of decoupling 
components are critical to suppress EMI related noise. 
Ways of EMI suppression include propagation limit and 
reduction of energy swings, such as inserting ferrite 
bead 
in 
power 
supply 
trace, 
selecting 
high 
self-resonance frequency decoupling capacitors and 
SW node ringing cancellation. Figure 4 is a simplified 
circuit showing that ringing is caused by diode’s 
junction capacitance Cj and Boost inductor L, which 
injects current swings into power supply traces; the 2 
voltage waveforms on the right illustrate the difference 
of circuit performance, with or without ringing 
cancellation.

Layout Considerations 
Layout design is an important step in all switching 
power supplies design. Good layout plays a positive 
role in loop stability, signal integrity and low EMI. Since 
the switch FET of SGM3752 works at a typical 
switching frequency of 1.2MHz, its power circuit layout 
needs to be designed more carefully. The SW node 
contains high dV/dt and di/dt switching. The area of SW 
node should be as small as possible, and the input and 
output loop needs to maintain the minimum loop path, 
which can effectively suppress the generation of ringing. 
For the high current path, it should be as wide and short 
as possible. The input capacitance CIN should be close 
to VIN pin and GND pin to reduce the influence of 
parasitic parameters on the line. The inductor and the 
Schottky diode should be placed close to the SW pin to 
reduce the area of the SW node, which reduces EMI. 
The output capacitance COUT should be as close to 
VOUT as possible, and the ground of COUT should be 
close to GND pin to reduce grounding return. FB 
resistors should be placed close to FB pin. For signal 
grounding, it is recommended to route the ground 
signal away from the power ground plane with small 
and short traces, and connect the signal ground with 
power ground via a single point close to the GND pin.
