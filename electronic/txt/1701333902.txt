GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM860 is a family of supply voltage supervisors 
(SVSs). It has four channels and each one can monitor 
a power rail with a high threshold accuracy of 0.35% 
(TYP). It also features very low quiescent current of 
6μA (TYP). 
Among the supply voltage supervisor (SVS-x, x = 1, 2, 
3, 4) circuits, four power rails are higher than 0.4V and 
one power rail is less than 0.4V (even with negative 
voltage). Once the SENSEy (y = 1, 2, 3, 4L, 4H) input 
voltage goes down below the configurable threshold, a 
nRESETx signal can be asserted by each SVS-x. The 
threshold of each SVS-x can be configured by the 
external resistors. 
A delay can be configured for each SVS-x before 
nRESETx is released. The delay time for each SVS can 
be set independently between 1.45ms and 10s via the 
CTx pin connection. Only SVS-1 has a manual reset 
signal (nMR) that the nRESETx is activated by a logic 
low of nMR. SVS-4 has two comparators to monitor the 
threshold window and the extra comparator can be 
used as a fifth SVS to monitor the negative voltage 
based on the voltage reference VREF.  
The SGM860 is available in a Green TQFN-4×4-20BL 
package. It operates over a junction temperature range 
of -40℃ to +125℃.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

Ground. 
13 
VREF 
O 
Reference Voltage Output Pin. SENSE4H can monitor a negative voltage if a resistor is 
connected between VREF and the negative power rail. This pin is designed to output 
current to the resistor(s). The resistor(s) does(do) not allow a voltage higher than 1.2V. 
This pin cannot be connected to a capacitor only. 
14 
VDD 
I 
Supply Voltage Pin. It is recommended to connect a 0.1μF ceramic capacitor near this 
pin. 
15 
nRESET1 
O 
nRESET1 to nRESET4 are the active-low reset outputs of for SVS-1 to SVS-4 
respectively. 
For SGM860A, nRESETx is an open-drain output pin. A pull-up resistor connected to VDD 
or other source is required. nRESETx goes low when asserted and goes high when 
released after the delay time set by CTx ends. 
For SGM860B, nRESETx is a push-pull output pin. This pin goes low when nRESETx is 
asserted and goes high when nRESETx is released after the delay time set by CTx ends.

nWDO 
O 
Watchdog Timer Output Pin. 
For SGM860A, nWDO is an open-drain output pin. When the watchdog timer runs out, 
this pin goes low. If not, it remains high. 
For SGM860B, nWDO is a push-pull output pin. When the watchdog timer runs out, this 
pin goes low. If not, it remains high. 
20 
WDI 
I 
Watchdog Timer Trigger Input Pin. A rising or falling edge within 630ms (TYP) period at 
this pin avoids the timeout failure of nWDO. The timer starts again once nRESET1 is 
released.

NOTES: 
1. If the WDI is toggled for a duration shorter than the watchdog timer timeout period (tWDT), it has a negitive influence on IDD. 
2. These parameters are outside the recommended VDD range and only determine the performance of the nRESETx output 
during VDD ramp up. 
3. The lowest supply voltage (VDD) required to activate nRESETx is defined as tRISE_VDD, and it must be greater than or equal to 
15μs/V. 
4. CTx are constant current charging sources that operate within the range of 0V to VTH_CTx, while the device is evaluated at VCTx 
= 0.5V.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
Overview 
The SGM860 is a family of multi-channel voltage 
supervisors. It has four SVS function sets within one 
device, including a watchdog timer, a window 
comparator and negative voltage detection. The 
SGM860 will assert the nRESETx (x = 1, 2, 3, 4) 
signals as shown in Table 1 to Table 4. When the reset 
signal is released, the nRESETx remains asserted 
during the delay time programmed by the users. It also 
features very low quiescent current of 6μA (TYP). 
 
Voltage Monitoring 
With an external resistor divider, any voltage threshold 
over 0.4V can be monitored through each SENSEy (y = 
1, 2, 3, 4L) pin. The SENSE4H pin can detect any 
over-voltage above 0.4V, or detect negative voltage 
through an external resistor divider. For more details, 
see the Sensing a Negative Voltage section. The 
SGM860 supports a wide range of voltage threshold 
detection and adjustable reset delay time, making 
these devices suitable for plenty of applications. 
The SGM860 is not susceptible to short negative 
transients on SENSEy. The curve of SENSEy minimum 
pulse width vs. threshold overdrive voltage shows that 
the sensitivity to transients depends on threshold 
overdrive. 
 
Manual Reset 
The SGM860 provides a choice to use the manual 
reset (nMR) pin to initial the device reset. The nMR 
input is a logic signal provided externally from other 
processors, logic circuits, and/or discrete sensors. 
Because nMR is tied to SVS-1, nRESET1 is usually 
taken as the primary source to reset for the processor. 
When nMR goes low, nRESET1 is asserted. When 
nMR goes high and SENSE1 is above the reset 
threshold, nRESET1 is released when the delay time is 
configured by the users. Knowing that the nMR pin is 
pulled up internally through a 100kΩ resisitor, connect 
nMR to VDD or just leave it floating once it is 
unnecessary to control it externally. 
If more than one signal are used to control the nMR 
function, please use multiple N-MOS transistors and a 
pull-up resistor to combine the logic signals together by 
wire-OR. 
 
Watchdog Timer 
The SGM860 has a specialized watchdog error output 
named nWDO. The nWDO is very helpful to detect and 
fix the hang-up problems of a processor. The watchdog 
function is connected to SVS-1 as well. Details of timing 
diagram for WDT is shown in Figure 7. When nRESET1 
is released, the WDT starts to count down. A logic level 
transition of WDI can reset the WDT and the timer 
starts to count down. However, if no transition of logic 
level is detected within tWDT, then the WDT is timeout 
and will assert the nWDO. After the nWDO is asserted, 
the device is latched unless a reset of nRESET1 is 
activated. For example, a negative nMR pulse, 
SENSE1 voltage is below VITN or VDD is off. 
In order to reset the processor when the WDT timeout 
event occurs, the user can combine the nWDO with 
nRESET1 by wire-OR. In legacy applications, where 
the WDT timeout asserts nRESET1, connect the 
nWDO to nMR. Figure 15 shows the connections, and 
Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the timing diagram. 
 
Reset Output 
In a typical application for SGM860, the user can 
connect the nRESETx pin to a processor like DSP, 
ASIC, FPGA and CPU as the reset input pin, or connect 
it to a voltage regulator like DC/DC converter and LDO 
as the enable input signal. 
The reset outputs of SGM860A are open-drain 
structure and pull-up resistors are needed to hold the 
lines high if nRESETx is not asserted. The nRESETx 
can be connected to other devices at correct voltage 
level by connecting the pull-up resistor to the proper 
voltage rails. Choose the pull-up resistor larger than 
10kΩ for the safe operation of output transistors. Any 
combination of nRESETx can be combined into one 
logic signal with the wire-OR logic. 
The SGM860B provides push-pull reset outputs and 
the logic high level is determined by VDD. Hence, the 
pull-up resistor is not needed and the board area can 
be saved. However, users must ensure that all interface 
logic level are checked and all nRESETx connections 
must match the VDD logic level.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
The nRESET outputs are defined when the VDD is 
higher than 0.9V. For the proper reset of the processor, 
VDD should be provided as early as possible in the 
application circuits. The initial power-on state is shown 
in Figure 2. Table 1 to Table 4 describe how the outputs 
are asserted or released. Timing diagrams of SVS-x 
are shown in Figure 3 to Figure 6. Once the conditions 
are qualified, the SVS-x transfers from asserted to 
released after a delay time set by the user. But the 
SVS-x transfers from released to asserted immediately 
with minimum propagation delay. The relationship 
between threshold voltages (VITN, VHYSN) and SENSEy 
voltage is depicted in Figure 5. SVS-1 to SVS-4 have 
the same behavior like Figure 5.

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
Under-Voltage Detection 
The SGM860 provides the SENSEy pins to monitor the 
system voltages. Once the voltage at SENSEy (y = 1, 2, 
3, 4L) drops below VITN, the corresponding reset pin 
goes low. If the voltage at SENSE4H is higher than VITP, 
the nRESET4 is activated. In order to smooth the 
transitions 
between 
reset 
output 
assertion 
or 
deassertion, an internal hysteresis is added to the 
comparators. To suppress the noise caused by 
transients, layout parasitics and interference between 
power rails, place a bypass capacitor in the range of 
1nF to 10nF at SENSEy. Figure 15 shows a typical 
connection of the resisitor divider network. Voltage rails 
down to 0.4V can be detected by SENSEy and the 
threshold voltages can be obtained with Equation 1 to 
Equation 3.

Sensing a Negative Voltage 
To monitor a voltage less than 0.4V (either positive or 
negative), the SVS-4 comparator along with voltage 
reference output VREF is used and the diagram is 
depicted in Figure 14. Here, the SVS-4 monitors the 
positive voltage and negative voltage at the power rail 
(in Figure 14, that is the ±15V supply to an operation 
amplifier) and the status of nRESET4 changes as 
described in Table 4. RS42H and RS42L are placed at high 
and low voltage positions, respectively. Calculation of 
the voltage threshold is presented in Equation 6 and 7.

In order to set the delay time as 315ms, a pull-up 
resistor in the range of 40kΩ to 200kΩ should be 
placed between the CTx pin and VDD. When the device 
powers up, a pull-down transistor connected between 
CTx and GND turns on to decide and check the CTx 
status. Therefore, a large current flow is aroused for the 
direct connection between CTx and GND. As for setting 
a fixed delay time of 21ms, keep the CTx pin floating. 
To set a delay time defined by the user, put a capacitor 
between CTx and GND and the delay time can be 
calculated as follows:

      (8) 
With Equation 8, a delay time from 1.45ms to 10s can 
be obtained. For the SGM860, to identify the 
capacitance between CTx and GND from a floating pin, 
choose the external capacitor greater than 220pF. The 
reset delay time is decided when the external capacitor 
voltage is charged to 1.24V by the on-chip and highly 
accurate current source of 285nA. Once the nRESET 
signal is asserted, the external capacitor is discharged. 
On the contrary, the internal current source is activated 
and starts to charge the external capacitor when the 
condition for releasing nRESETx occurs. If the CTx 
voltage rises up to 1.24V, the corresponding nRESET is 
released. As for the capacitor, choose a low leakage 
one such as ceramic capacitor. Note that the reset 
delay time may be different from the one set by users 
because of the stray capacitance at this pin. The CTx 
pins are susceptible to interference, and their routing 
should be as short as possible, requiring shielding 
treatment.

Detailed Design Procedure 
To make sure VOL is not higher than 0.4V, choose the 
pull-up resistors of 100kΩ. 
The startup delay time of 100ms for all channels with 
CT = 23nF can be calculated with Equation 8. 
Choose a resistor of 10kΩ for RSxL to guarantee a high 
DC accuracy. 
The values of RSxH and RS4M can be calculated using 
Equation 1 to 5 with standard 1% resistors. The table 
below shows the results.

Due to the lack of a separate fault input of watchdog for 
FPGA, use a legacy connection of nWDO and nMR.

Power Supply Recommendations 
The SGM860 works from 1.8V to 6.5V input voltage. It 
is a good analog practice to place a 0.1μF capacitor 
between VDD and GND. The input power supply must 
be higher than 1.8V normally to avoid reset activated by 
the internal UVLO circuit. 
 
Layout 
Some guidelines are given below to prepare the layout 
of the printed-circuit board (PCB) for SGM860. 
1) CTx pins routing should be as short as possible to 
improve accuracy and require shielding treatment. 
2) Take short traces from SENSEy to the resistor 
divider and long traces from RSxH to VMON_x. 
3) Connect the VDD capacitor as close as possible to 
the device. 
4) Use short traces to connect VDD. The parasitic 
inductance from the supply to the capacitor and the 
capacitor at VDD form an LC tank and may lead to ring 
voltages that higher than the maximum allowed VDD 
voltage.
