GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The 
high-speed, 
single-channel 
low-side 
driver 
SGM48520 is designed to drive GaN FETs and logic 
level MOSFETs. Application areas include LiDAR, time 
of flight, facial recognition, and power converters using 
low-side drivers. The SGM48520 provides 6A source 
and 4A sink output current capability. Split output 
configuration allows individual turn-on and turn-off time 
optimization depending on FET. Package and pinout 
with minimum parasitic inductances reduce the rise and 
fall time and limit the ringing. Additionally, the 2.3ns 
propagation delay with minimized tolerances and 
variations allows efficient operation at high frequencies. 
The driver has internal under-voltage lockout and 
over-temperature protection against overload and fault 
events. 
The SGM48520 is available in Green WLCSP-0.88× 
1.28-6B and TDFN-2×2-6AL packages.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
The 
high-speed, 
single-channel 
low-side 
driver 
SGM48520 is designed to drive GaN FETs and logic 
level MOSFETs. Application areas include LiDAR, time 
of flight, facial recognition, and power converters using 
low-side drivers. 
SGM48520 provides the lowest propagation delay of 
2.3ns from the driver to the power transistor. 
SGM48520 adopts small WLCSP package with very 
small parasitic inductance. This package reduces 
ringing and increases current drive capability in high 
frequency applications when driving power transistors. 
Input Stage 
There are two Schmitt triggers at the input pins IN+ and 
IN- to improve noise immunity. In order to prevent the 
output from accidentally turning on when the input is in 
the floating state, IN+ is internally connected to a 
pull-down resistor, and IN- is internally connected to a 
pull-up resistor. The output signal depends on the logic 
voltage levels on the IN+ and IN- pins (which are not a 
differential input pair). 
Output Stage 
SGM48520 provides 6A peak source and 4A sink 
currents, and the outputs are separated to allow 
custom pull-up and pull-down drive strength to suit the 
application. Each of OUTH and OUTL pins can be 
connected to transistor gates with separate drive 
resistors, adjusting the driving speed of turning on and 
off to control the slew rate and EMI of the driving signal 
and the ringing on the gate signal. Controlling ringing 
as much as possible reduces the stress on the driver 
and switch device, which is very important for 
high-performance applications and reliability of GaN 
FETs. In order to prevent the device CISS from turning 
the FET on by mistake, the OUTL pin will be pulled low 
in under-voltage conditions. 
VDD and Under-Voltage Lockout 
The rated working voltage of SGM48520 is 5V ± 0.25V, 
and the maximum power supply voltage of the part is 
5.75V. In the application, the error of the power supply 
of the driver chip needs to be ensured within 0.25V, and 
the transient overshoot voltage of the power supply 
cannot exceed the maximum voltage of the part. In the 
VDD Overshoot Solution section, there are more 
specific design details. 
SGM48520 provides under-voltage lockout (UVLO) 
function to protect the circuit in the event of a fault 
condition. The UVLO trigger point is set at 4.15V, and 
the hysteresis voltage is 78mV. This UVLO level 
ensures that the GaN FET operates in the low RDSON 
region. When UVLO is triggered, the output is low. 
Over-Temperature Protection (OTP) 
The 
SGM48520 
provides 
an 
over-temperature 
protection (OTP) function with a trigger point of +175°C. 
The hysteresis temperature is 26°C. If the OTP is 
triggered, switching action is stopped with OUTL held 
low. Then when the junction temperature of the device 
falls below +149°C, normal operation resumes.

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
Since the output of the PWM controller cannot often 
provide the voltage required by the gate of the power 
device, a high-performance gate driver is usually 
required between the PWM output of the controller and 
the gate of the GaN transistor, so that the GaN 
transistor can operate at correct gate voltages. In 
addition, the gate driver can reduce switching losses 
and maximize the performance of GaN transistors in 
high-frequency applications. Especially in the field of 
digital power control, it is common for the PWM signal 
of the digital controller to be a 3.3V logic signal, and 
GaN transistors cannot work optimally with this gate 
voltage. The gate driver boosts the 3.3V signal to the 
preferred gate drive voltage of 5V, which fully turns on 
the power device and minimizes conduction losses. 
The good noise immunity of the SGM48520 gate driver 
also minimizes the effects of high frequency switching 
noise when the driver is placed near the power switch. 
Adding a gate driver also transfers the gate charge 
power loss from the controller to the driver, effectively 
reducing the power consumption and thermal stress in 
the controller. 
SGM48520 is a low-side high-speed gate driver with a 
maximum operating frequency of 60MHz and an 
operating voltage of 5V. It is optimized to drive GaN 
FETs. The output has an independent configuration 
architecture, which can flexibly adjust the turn-on and 
turn-off speed, while providing a strong current sinking 
and sourcing capabilities. 
The SGM48520 is primarily used to drive GaN 
transistors, which are used in various power converters, 
LiDAR, wireless chargers, and synchronous rectifiers. 
The SGM48520 can be used as a driver for high-speed 
pulsed laser diodes. 
Typical Application 
A typical application circuit for the SGM48520 is 
shown in Figure 1, with a single-channel, 5V drive 
voltage, which is specifically designed to drive GaN 
transistors or logic-level Si FETs. The output has a 
separated structure, so that the turn-on and turn-off 
speeds can be controlled separately by driving 
resistors. If it is not necessary to adjust the turn-on 
and turn-off speeds separately, OUTH and OUTL may 
be connected directly together (with a single gate 
drive resistor added if necessary). 
In order to avoid voltage overstress caused by the 
parasitic inductance of the drive circuit, SGMICRO 
recommends the use of at least 2Ω resistors at OUTH 
and OUTL. 
For applications requiring a smaller resistance value, 
please contact SGMICRO E2E for guidance. 
Design Requirements 
There are some key factors to consider when designing 
with the SGM48520 gate driver and GaN power FETs, 
especially for high MHz frequency (or nanosecond 
pulse) applications. These factors include circuit layout, 
PCB trace design, passive component selection, and 
maximum operating frequency. 
Detailed Design Procedure 
Handling Ground Bounce 
Place the ground pin of the SGM48520 as close as 
possible to the source of the low-side FET to get the 
smallest gate current loop, the smallest parasitic 
inductance, and maximize the switching performance. 
However, this can cause ground bounce on the 
SGM48520, resulting in incorrect switching logic at the 
input and wrong level at the output. 
In order to eliminate this effect, SGM48520 has built-in 
Schmitt triggers on the input terminals to increase the 
input hysteresis. Equation 1 shows the relationship 
between the input hysteresis and the maximum 
allowable di/dt:

APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued) 
Assuming that the parasitic inductance is 0.7nH and 
the hysteresis voltage is 0.7V, the maximum allowable 
current slew rate is 1A/ns by calculation. If the current 
slew rate generated in the application is higher than 
1A/ns, this exceeds the hysteresis voltage range and 
causes the output signal to be unstable. Using the 
inverting input to accept the PWM signal and 
connecting the non-inverting input to VDD reduce the 
possibility of false pulses or oscillations and improve 
stability. High di/dt produces high transient voltage 
spikes that affect the input of the SGM48520. In order 
to protect the device from a large current spike at IN-, a 
100Ω current limiting resistor can be placed before the 
IN- input. 
If the current slew rate is not too high, and the pulse 
width is not very short (for example, 1ns range), the 
extra delay can be accepted. The parasitic capacitance 
of the SGM48520 input can be used to good advantage 
to create an RC filter to reduce high-frequency noise by 
adding a resistor in series with the input pin. The 
SGM48520 has stable input capacitance of about 5pF 
at the input pins, which is convenient for this purpose. 
If the environment is more severe, using a common 
mode choke coil can increase the stability of the 
system. 
In applications that use current sensing resistors, the 
ground bounce phenomenon is particularly serious. In 
the application circuit with current sense resistor shown 
in Figure 3, the ground of the SGM48520 is connected 
to the source of the GaN FET, and one side of the 
current sense resistor is connected to the controller 
ground. In the case of high-speed switching and large 
current, the potential rebound due to the parasitic 
inductance of the current detection resistor will cause 
the circuit to turn on/off by mistake, and in severe cases 
may cause damage to the device. Figure 5 shows the 
solution for this situation: Use a common mode choke 
between the controller output and the SGM48520 input. 
When the pulse width is not extremely narrow, a 
resistor can also be added to the signal output line 
before SGM48520 to form an RC filter as a supplement. 
Although the circuit of Figure 4 improves the ground 
bounce problem by connecting the GND of the driver to 
the signal ground after the current sense resistor, this 
circuit is not recommended. The drawback of this circuit 
is that the voltage drop across the current sense 
resistor and its parasitic inductance reduce the 
transient and DC gate drive voltage to the FET, thus 
reducing the efficiency. In severe cases, the voltage 
ringing caused by the inductance of the sense resistor 
path can even cause the FET to spuriously turn on and 
off.  For these reasons, the circuit of Figure 5 is the 
preferred solution to ground bounce problems.

Creating Nanosecond Pulse with SGM48520 
SGM48520 can provide a minimum 1ns pulse width 
output to capacitive load. However, outputting such a 
small equivalent pulse width requires a very powerful 
digital driver and also needs to consider the influence of 
parasitic parameters from the digital output to the 
SGM48520 input. Using the two inputs of SGM48520 
and the AND gate can get a method of generating short 
pulses at the output. As shown in Figure 6, connect one 
digital signal to IN+, and the other delayed digital signal 
to IN-, so that a narrow pulse will appear at the output, 
the width of which is equal to the delay time of the two 
digital signals. The digital controller only needs to 
control the delay time in the range of nanoseconds, 
which reduces the requirement for the SGM48520 input 
signal. If the digital signal has only one output, an RC 
low-pass filter can be used to generate a signal with an 
adjustable delay time, which is related to the RC time 
constant.

APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued) 
VDD Overshoot Solution 
Due to the existence of PCB parasitic inductance, 
inductance ringing and transient overshoot voltage are 
prone to occur under high current switching conditions. 
In the PCB design process, it is necessary to evaluate 
and control the overshoot caused by the ringing, so as 
not to exceed the stress of the device. The strength of 
the overshoot voltage and the percentage of the 
overshoot 
duration 
to 
the 
switching 
time 
are 
parameters that affect the stress. Keeping the 
overshoot below maximum allowable pin voltage is the 
best solution. The parasitic inductance can be 
decreased by optimizing PCB layout. To limit the 
voltage overshoot, low ESL components and series 
resistance can be helpful as well. If the overshoot is too 
large, the accuracy of the power supply needs to be 
considered. For example, if the overshoot voltage is 
0.5V, the maximum error voltage of the power supply 
cannot exceed 5.25V (5% accuracy). Therefore, if the 
overshoot voltage is large, a power supply with higher 
accuracy is necessary. 
Applications at High Frequencies 
SGM48520 has a rise/fall time of 550ps/480ps, and 
provides a minimum output capability of 1ns pulse 
width and a maximum operating frequency of 60MHz. 
According to the capacitive load, different output modes 
and frequencies can be selected. Under the working 
condition of high-frequency pulse, in order to prevent 
the device from overheating, a high-frequency pulse 
train with a certain interval time can be used. This can 
increase the transient frequency and keep the effective 
value of the output current unchanged. At this time, a 
larger decoupling capacitor is needed to charge the 
capacitive load at a high frequency.

Power Supply Recommendations 
In order to provide high peak current when the FET is 
turned on and improve the stability of the VDD pin 
supply voltage, a low ESR/ESL ceramic capacitor 
needs to be used as a bypass capacitor placed as 
close as possible to the IC's VDD and GND pins. To 
avoid ringing at the IC pins as much as possible, the 
decoupling capacitors need to be placed on the same 
side as the IC, and vias cannot be used. 
In order to achieve the best transient performance, 
SGMICRO recommends choosing a three-terminal 
capacitor and a capacitor with a larger capacitance in 
parallel. The three-terminal capacitor needs to be 
placed close to the VDD and GND pins of the IC, and 
the other capacitor is placed close to the three-terminal 
capacitor. The three-terminal capacitor has the lowest 
ESL, and the larger capacitor provides enough drive 
peak current. Under normal circumstances, it is 
recommended to use 0.1µF 0402 or through-core 
capacitors in parallel with 1µF 0603 capacitors. 
Layout Guidelines 
Proper PCB layout is extremely important in a 
high-current, 
fast-switching 
circuit 
to 
provide 
appropriate device operation and design robustness. 
SGM48520 provides WLCSP ball grid array package, 
which can reduce the parasitic inductance in the 
connection line with BGA type GaN FET. 
In order to achieve the best performance, a PCB with at 
least four routing layers is recommended to minimize 
the parasitic inductance. Using resistors and capacitors 
in a smaller package (0201) can also minimize 
inductance and PCB space. It is necessary to calculate 
the resistor power of a small package to meet the 
requirements of gate drive power loss. 
Drive Loop Inductance and Grounding 
SGM48520 should be placed as close to the GaN FET 
as possible, and the trace of the gate drive circuit 
should be as wide as possible to reduce parasitic 
inductance. 
To achieve minimum drive loop inductance, it is 
recommended to use the second layer of the PCB as 
the source loop of the GaN FET, near the bottom of the 
device (top layer). Both the vias that are connected to 
the GND pin and the source of the FET are connected 
to this layer with minimal impedance. Please note that 
the coupling of the ground plane will be decreased only 
when the GND plane is connected to the source power 
plane at the FET. 
 
Bypass Capacitor 
The VDD pin requires a bypass capacitor connected to 
GND, placed as close to the pins of the SGM48520 as 
physically possible. The capacitor should be connected 
to VDD and GND power planes, which should be large 
and as close to the top layer of the PCB as possible. 
Due to the high operating frequency of the IC, the 
inductance of the bypass capacitor is critical, so the 
value of the bypass capacitor should be between 0.1µF 
and 1µF, and the material should be X7R or better. The 
best capacitors for the application are low inductance 
chip capacitors (LICC), interdigital capacitors (IDC), 
feedthrough and LGA capacitors. Finally, in order to 
meet the demand of driving peak current, an extra 1μF 
capacitor between VDD and GND should be added in 
parallel close to the IC.
