GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM42606 is a motor driver device with one 
integrated H-bridge that can run a DC motor, a solenoid, 
one winding of a bipolar stepper motor, or other devices. 
It can be used in a variety of applications such as 
consumer products, toys and other battery-powered 
motion-control applications. 
This device integrates four N-MOSFETs, which can 
operate over a supply voltage range of 2V to 12V. With 
proper heatsinking, the SGM42606 can deliver up to 6A 
peak output current and 3A continuous output current. 
The required gate drive voltages are generated by an 
internal charge pump. 
A number of protection features are provided in the 
device including over-current, short-circuit, over-voltage, 
under-voltage lockout and thermal shutdown. 
The SGM42606 is available in a Green TQFN-5.5×3.5-24L 
package.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
Overview 
The SGM42606 is a single H-bridge motor driver with 
current regulation circuitry. A number of protection 
circuits are also provided in the device. 
The device can operate from 2V to 12V single supply 
and has the ability to drive up to 6A peak output 
current.  
Table 1 lists the operation mode for the SGM42606.

NOTE: 1. When nSLEEP is logic low for longer than 5μs, the 
device will enter into sleep mode. And it is at least 8ms from 
nSLEEP inactive logic high to H-bridge on. 
 
Bridge Control and Decay Modes 
Please refer to the input control logic below on Table 2. 
Shoot-through is prevented inside the device, if INxL 
and INxH are both high, the high-side and low-side 
N-MOSFETs of output will both be off.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Current Limit Protection 
The current through the motor windings may be limited, 
or controlled, by a fixed-frequency PWM current 
regulation, or current chopping. For DC motors, current 
control is used to limit the start-up and stall current of 
the motor. For stepper motors, current control is often 
used at all times. 
When an H-bridge and current limit protection function 
are enabled, current rises through the winding at a rate 
dependent on the DC voltage and inductance of the 
winding. If the current reaches the current chopping 
threshold, the bridge disables the current until the 
beginning of the next PWM cycle. Note that 
immediately after the current is enabled, the voltage on 
the ISEN pin is ignored for a fixed period of time before 
enabling the current sense circuitry. This blanking time 
is fixed at 2.5μs. This blanking time also sets the 
minimum on-time of the PWM when operating in 
current chopping mode. 
The PWM chopping current is set by a comparator 
which compares the voltage across a current sense 
resistor connected to the ISEN pins with a reference 
voltage. The reference voltage is fixed at 200mV. The 
chopping current is calculated in Equation 1. 
 
CHOP
ISENSE
200mV
I
= R
                 (1) 
 
For example, If a 1Ω sense resistor is used, the 
chopping current will be 200mV/1Ω = 200mA. Once the 
chopping current threshold is reached, the H-bridge 
switches slow decay mode. Winding current is 
re-circulated by enabling both of the low-side 
MOSFETs in the bridge. This state is held until the 
beginning of the next fixed-frequency PWM cycle. 
The current limit protection function is disabled when 
nCLIP_EN = high and enabled when nCLIP_EN = low. 
 
Dead Time 
Dead time is used to prevent the crossover during 
high-side and low-side MOSFETs switching. The 
SGM42606 has a dead time (tDEAD) of about 220ns 
(low-side off to high-side on)/170ns (high-side off to 
low-side on). 
 
Power Supplies and Input Pins 
The charge pump is used to generate a gate supply 
greater than VCC to turn on the internal N-MOSFETs. A 
0.1μF ceramic capacitor is required between VCP and 
VCC pins. Connect a 0.1μF capacitor and a 10μF or 
larger (ceramic) capacitor between VCC and GND pins 
as close to the device as possible. 
 
Device Functional Modes 
The nSLEEP is an active low input to put the device in 
low-power (sleep mode) state. In sleep mode, all 
internal logic, bridges and charge pump are disabled 
(stopped). 
 
Protection Circuits 
A number of protection features are provided in the 
SGM42606 
including 
over-current, 
under-voltage 
lockout, over-voltage protection and thermal shutdown. 
 
Over-Current Protection (OCP) 
All switches of the H-bridge are current limit and if an 
over-current is detected on one of them, its gate drive 
signal is removed. If the current limit persists for a 
period longer than the OCP time, all H-bridge 
MOSFETs are disabled. The driver will be re-enabled 
after the OCP retry period (tRETRY) has passed.  
Over-current will occur due to an output short to ground, 
to power supply, or across the motor windings.  
 
Under-Voltage Lockout (UVLO) 
If the voltages on VCC pin fall below their under-voltage 
lockout threshold, the device will be disabled, and the 
internal logic will be reset. Device resumes operation 
when all of them go back above their UVLO thresholds. 
 
Over-Voltage Lockout (OVLO) 
If the voltages on VCC pin rise more than their 
over-voltage lockout threshold, the device will be 
disabled. Device resumes operation when power 
supply voltage falls back below OVLO thresholds. 
 
Thermal Shutdown (TSD) 
All bridges and drivers are shutdown if a junction over- 
temperature 
occurs 
in 
the 
device. 
Once 
the 
temperature goes back to the safe level, device 
resumes its operation.
