OCTOBER 2014 –REV. A. 3 
GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM9146 is a 4-channel, 6th-order output 
reconstruction filter which can operate from 3.1V to 
5.5V single power supply. It is designed to replace 
passive LC filters and drivers with an integrated device. 
One channel is Standard Definition (SD) filter while the 
rest three channels are configurable between HDi and 
HDp filters. 
The device allows DC- or AC-coupled output. 
SGM9146 can be DC-coupled or AC-coupled with input 
video signal to eliminate out-of-band noise, such as the 
output stage of DAC. Internal clamp and bias circuitry 
may be used if AC-coupled inputs are required. 
The SGM9146 is available in a Green TSSOP-14 
package. It operates over an ambient temperature 
range of -40℃ to +85℃.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.
