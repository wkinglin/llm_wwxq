GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM4700 is a high-power, high efficiency, stereo 
Class-D audio power amplifier with adjustable power limit 
(APL) and automatic level control (ALC). It operates with a 
wide range of supply voltages from 5V to 20V. With 15V 
supply voltage, it can deliver 2 × 23W output power for a pair 
of 4Ω speakers with 1% THD+N, or an ALC output power of 2 
× 20W with THD+N less than 0.5%.  
The high efficiency of SGM4700 extends battery life in playing 
music and allows it to deliver an output power of 2 × 20W 
without the need for a bulky heat sink on a two-layer system 
board. Its high PSRR and low EMI emission reduce system 
design and manufacturing complexities, as well as lower 
system cost.  
The SGM4700 features APL and ALC. The APL limits peak 
audio outputs to a user-defined value to protect audio 
speakers from excessive power dissipation or over-load. The 
APL and ALC adjust the voltage gain of the audio amplifiers in 
response to over-limit audio inputs, eliminating output clipping 
distortion while maintaining a maximally allowed dynamic 
range of audio outputs. The limiting voltage of APL and ALC 
can be either a user-defined value or the supply voltage.  
The SGM4700 can be configured into driving either a pair of 
speakers in Bridge-Tied-Load (BTL) configuration for stereo 
applications or a single speaker in Parallel BTL (PBTL) 
configuration for mono applications. 
The SGM4700 features two PWM modulation schemes for 
Class-D audio amplifiers: Dual-Side-Modulation (DSM) and 
Single-Side-Modulation (SSM).  
In SGM4700, comprehensive protection modes against 
various operating faults ensure its safe and reliable operation.

NOTES: 
1. The peak supply voltage including its tolerance over various operating conditions must not exceed its absolute-maximum-rated value (26V). 
Exposure to absolute-maximum-rated supply voltage may damage the device or affect device reliability permantly. 
2. For high power applications, the maximum power supply VDD that can be applied to the SGM4700 is largely limited by the thermal dissipation 
capability of the package and the system board layout. 
3. The SGM4700 is specfied with an 8Ω resistive load in series with 33µH inductive load or with a 4Ω resistive load in series with 33µH inductive 
load or with a 3Ω resistive load in series with 15µH inductive load (in PBTL configuration). Without inductive loads, the maximum continous output 
power will severely suffer from efficiency and thermal degradation. 
4. If the input supply is located more than a few centimeters from SGM4700, additional bulk capacitor may be required in addition to the ceramic 
capacitors.

IMPORTANT APPLICATION NOTES 
Output Power Considerations  
1. The maximum output power of SGM4700 is 
determined primarily by the power supply (its output 
voltage and current) and speaker impedance. As a high 
power audio amplifier, the maximum output power of 
SGM4700 can be severely limited by the thermal 
dissipation capability of the system board layout.  
2. The SGM4700 is packaged with an exposed thermal 
pad on the underside of the device. Solder the thermal 
pad directly onto a large grounded metal island (GND) 
underneath the package, as a thermal sink for proper 
thermal dissipation. On the grounded metal island, 
place several rows of solid, equally-spaced vias 
connecting to the bottom layer of the system board. 
Failure to do so can severely limit its thermal 
dissipation capability. It might even cause the device 
going into over-temperature mute occasionally.  
3. Use wide open areas around the SGM4700 on the 
top and bottom layers of the system board as the 
ground plane GND. Place lots of solid vias connecting 
the top and bottom layers of GND. Furthermore, for 
proper 
thermal 
dissipation, 
reserve 
wide 
and 
uninterrupted GND areas along the thermal flow on the 
top layer, i.e., no wires cutting through the GND layer 
and obstructing the thermal flow in the proximity of the 
device.  
4. All the power ground pins PGND are directly shorted 
to the ground plane GND as a central “star” ground for 
the SGM4700. Use a single point of connection 
between the analog ground AGND and the ground 
plane GND to minimize the coupling of high-current 
switching noise onto audio signals.  
5. The power supply pins, PVDD, for the audio 
amplifiers’ output stages are directly connected 
together with short and wide metal traces.  
6. Use direct and low-impedance traces from the audio 
outputs (VOPL/R and VONL/R) to their individual 
output filters and speakers.  
Output Filter Considerations 
7. For most applications, the SGM4700 does not 
require an LC output filter when speaker wires are less 
than 10cm. 
8. A ferrite bead filter constructed from a ferrite bead 
and a ceramic capacitor can be used to suppress EMI. 
Choose a ferrite bead with a rated current no less than 
3A for 8Ω loads, 5A for 4Ω loads, and 7A for 3Ω or less 
loads (in PBTL configuration). Place the filter tightly 
together and as close as possible to the audio 
amplifier’s output pins. A ferrite bead filter can also 
reduce high-frequency interference.  
9. For applications where EMC requirements are 
extremely stringent or speaker wires are long, use a 
second-order LC low-pass filter. Place the filter tightly 
together and as close as possible to the audio amplifier’s 
output pins. The LC output filter must be designed 
specifically for the speaker load since the load impedance 
affects the quality factor of the filter.  
General Considerations  
10. The SGM4700 requires adequate power supply 
decoupling to ensure its peak output power, high 
efficiency, low distortion, and low EMI emissions. Place 
each supply decoupling capacitor as individually close 
as possible to AVDD and PVDD pins.  
11. Place a small decoupling resistor (10Ω) between 
the system power supply and AVDD to prevent high 
frequency Class-D transient spikes from interfering with 
the on-chip linear amplifiers.  
12. For best noise performance, use differential inputs 
from the audio source for SGM4700. In single-ended 
input applications, the unused inputs of SGM4700 must 
be AC-grounded at the audio source. Also, take care to 
match the impedances seen at two differential inputs 
closely.  
13. The maximum input signal dictates the required 
voltage gain to achieve the desired maximum output 
power. For best noise performance, consider a voltage 
gain as low as possible.  
14. Do not alter the logic state of the MODS pin while 
the device is in operation. To change the setting of the 
pin, the device must be first brought into shutdown 
mode by pulling the EN pin low for at least 10ms before 
it can be restored to its normal operation.

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
The SGM4700 is a high-power, high efficiency, stereo 
Class-D audio power amplifier with adjustable power 
limit (APL) and automatic level control (ALC). It 
operates with a wide range of supply voltages from 5V 
to 20V. With 15V supply voltage, it can deliver 2 × 23W 
output power for a pair of 4Ω speakers with 1% THD+N, 
or an ALC output power of 2 × 20W with THD+N less 
than 0.5%. With 18V supply voltage, it can deliver into a 
pair of 8Ω speakers an output power of 2 × 18W with 1% 
THD+N, or an ALC output power of 2 × 16W with THD+N 
less than 0.5%.  
The high efficiency of SGM4700 extends battery life in 
playing music and allows it to deliver an output power 
of 2 × 20W without the need for a bulky heat sink on a 
two-layer system board. Its high PSRR and low EMI 
emission reduce system design and manufacturing 
complexities, as well as thus lower system cost.  
The SGM4700 features APL and ALC. The APL limits 
peak audio outputs to a user-defined value to protect 
audio speakers from excessive power dissipation and 
over-load. The APL and ALC adjust the voltage gain of 
the audio amplifiers in response to over-limit audio 
inputs, eliminating output clipping distortion while 
maintaining a maximally allowed dynamic range of 
audio outputs. The limiting voltage of APL and ALC can 
be either the supply voltage or a user-defined value.  
The SGM4700 can be configured into driving either a 
pair 
of 
speakers 
in 
Bridge-Tied-Load 
(BTL) 
configuration for stereo applications or a single speaker 
in Parallel BTL (PBTL) configuration for mono 
applications. In PBTL configuration, with 15V supply 
voltage, it can deliver into a 3Ω speaker an output 
power of 33W with 1% THD+N, or an ALC output power 
of 30W with THD+N less than 0.5%.  
The SGM4700 features two PWM modulation schemes 
for use in Class-D audio amplifiers: Dual-Side- 
Modulation (DSM) and Single-Side-Modulation (SSM), 
allowing for system optimization for higher efficiency or 
lower THD.  
The SGM4700 includes comprehensive protection 
modes against various operating faults including 
under-voltage, 
over-voltage, 
over-current, 
over- 
temperature, and DC-detect for safe and reliable 
operation.  
Operating Mode Control 
The SGM4700 features APL and ALC modes of 
operation. In APL mode, peak audio outputs are 
clamped (hard-limited) to a voltage level defined by the 
PLIMIT pin, protecting audio speakers from excessive 
power dissipation and over-load. 
As described in Table 1, depending upon the pin 
voltage at PLIMIT and the pin configuration at ALC, the 
SGM4700 can be configured into one of four operating 
modes: Mute, APL, ALC, and Traditional. In SGM4700, 
the pin voltage at PLIMIT, VPLIMIT, defines the limiting 
voltage of audio outputs for both APL and ALC modes. 
If VPLIMIT is set less than 0.3V, the device operates in 
mute mode regardless of the pin configuration at ALC.  
If VPLIMIT is set higher than 4.5V with the ALC pin 
unconnected, the device operates in a traditional 
Class-D mode without APL or ALC. In this mode, the 
output clipping distortion will occur as peak output 
voltages reach to the supply voltage PVDD. 
If VPLIMIT is set in the range from 0.7V to 2.5V with the 
ALC pin connected to ground through an external 
resistor of 0kΩ, 68kΩ or 300kΩ, the device operates in 
APL mode. The audio outputs in APL mode are limited 
to a value approximately equal to (6 × VPLIMIT). 
If VPLIMIT is set higher than 4.5V with the ALC pin 
connected to ground through an external resistor of 
0kΩ, 68kΩ or 300kΩ, the device operates in ALC mode 
and the limiting voltage of audio outputs is internally set 
at the supply voltage. Thus, the peak voltage of audio 
outputs is limited to a value that is substantially close to 
PVDD.

GVDD Supply 
The GVDD is an internally generated supply voltage for 
internal circuitry. It is also used as the supply voltage for 
the resistor divider to set the voltage at the PLIMIT pin. 
It is highly suggested to decouple the GVDD pin with a 
1μF ceramic capacitor to ground for stable operation. 
Note that the current drawn from the GVDD pin by 
external circuitry, including all the resistor dividers at 
ALC, GAIN, FREQ, and PLIMIT pins, must be kept less 
than 5mA.  
Mute Control 
The SGM4700 can be configured into mute mode when 
the PLIMIT pin is pulled low by an inverting transistor, 
as shown in Figure 5. In mute mode, the output stages 
of both audio amplifiers are in Hi-Z and the differential 
audio outputs (VOPL/R and VONL/R) are pulled to 
ground through on-chip resistors respectively. To 
restore to its normal operation, the output of the 
inverting transistor is reverted to Hi-Z state, allowing 
the resistor divider (from GVDD to ground) tapped at 
the PLIMIT pin to set the voltage limit for APL.

Automatic Level Control (ALC) 
The automatic level control is to maintain the audio 
outputs for a maximum voltage swing without clip 
distortion when excessive inputs that may cause output 
clipping are applied. With ALC, the SGM4700 lowers 
the voltage gain of both audio amplifiers to an 
appropriate value such that output clipping is 
substantially eliminated.  
In Figure 6, “Attack” is the duration where the voltage 
gain of the audio amplifiers decreases until output 
clipping is substantially eliminated. “Release” is the 
duration where the voltage gain of the audio amplifiers 
recovers (increases) until it reaches to a value that is 
maximally allowed without output clipping.

ALC Mode Select 
The SGM4700 can be configured into ALC or Non-ALC 
mode via the ALC pin, as described in Table 2. When 
the ALC pin is left unconnected, the SGM4700 
operates in Non-ALC mode. The Non-ALC mode is 
typically chosen for applications where maximum audio 
loudness is desired and the amount of output clipping 
distortions can be measurably controlled at the audio 
source. In other pin configurations, the SGM4700 
operates in ALC mode with three specific audio 
dynamic characteristics. For most applications, the ALC 
mode is preferred for its capability to substantially 
eliminate output clipping distortion, excessive power 
dissipation and speaker over-load.

APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued) 
Three sets of ALC dynamic characteristics can be 
selected for specific sound effects, as described in Table 
2. The ALC-1 mode (the ALC pin shorted to GND) plays 
music in a most mellow manner with negligible amount 
of clipping distortion and lower average output power. 
On the other hand, the ALC-3 mode (the ALC pin 
shorted to GND via a 300kΩ resistor) plays music in a 
most dynamic manner with some extent of clipping 
distortion and higher average output power (loudness).

Voltage Gain Setting 
To accommodate various application requirements, the 
SGM4700 features 4 selectable voltage gains for audio 
amplifiers. An external resistor RGAIN from the GAIN pin 
to ground sets the voltage gain, as shown in Table 3. 
Although the voltage gains as described in Table 3 vary 
a little (less than 2%) from parts to parts, the input 
impedances at the same voltage gain may vary by ±20% 
over parts, due to process variations in the actual 
resistance of the input resistors. For design purposes, 
the input impedance should be assumed to be 10kΩ, 
which is the absolute minimum input impedance of the 
audio amplifiers in SGM4700. At lower gain settings, 
the input impedance could be as high as 60kΩ.

The voltage gain of the audio amplifiers can be slightly 
adjusted by inserting small external input resistors RINE, 
in series with the input capacitors CIN, as depicted in 
Figure 7 and Figure 8 for differential and single-ended 
inputs respectively. In the figures, it is required that CIN 
= CINL1/2 = CINR1/2 and RINE = RINL1/2 = RINR1/2. 
As depicted in Figure 8, the unused inputs of SGM4700

The choice of the voltage gain will strongly influence 
the loudness and quality of audio sounds. In general, 
the higher the voltage gain is, the louder the sound is 
perceived. However an excessive voltage gain may 
cause audio outputs to be severely clipped (Non-ALC 
mode) or compressed (ALC mode) for high-level (loud) 
audio sounds. On the other hand, an unusually low gain 
may cause relatively low-level (quite) sounds soft or 
inaudible. Thus it is crucial to choose a proper voltage 
gain for well balanced audio quality.

APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued) 
The voltage gain is chosen based upon various 
system-level considerations including the supply 
voltage, the dynamic range of audio sources and 
speaker loads, and the desired sound effects. As a 
general guideline, the voltage gain can be simply 
expressed in Equation 2. In the equation, VIN,MAX (in 
VRMS) is the maximum input level from the audio source, 
PVDD (in volts) is the supply voltage, and α is the 
design parameter, which ranges from 0.66 to 1.0. The 
higher α is, the higher the average output power (louder) 
is, with some degree of compression for high-level 
audio sounds.

PWM Frequency Setting 
To accommodate various application requirements, the 
SGM4700 features two selectable PWM frequencies 
with optional spread-spectrum for the Class-D audio 
amplifiers. An external resistor RFREQ from the FREQ 
pin to ground sets the PWM frequency and optional 
spread-spectrum, as shown in Table 5.

PWM Modulation Scheme 
To accommodate various application requirements, the 
SGM4700 features two PWM modulation schemes, i.e., 
Single-Side-Modulation 
(SSM) 
and 
Double-Side- 
Modulation (DSM). In typical applications, the SSM 
scheme is preferred for its lower EMI and higher PSRR 
and efficiency. The modulation scheme is selected via 
the MODS pin, as described in Table 6. The PWM 
modulation scheme is latched during power-up and 
cannot be changed while the device is in operation.  
Table 6. Modulation Scheme Select 
MODS Pin 
Modulation Scheme 
Low or Open 
Single-Side-Modulation (SSM)

Double-Side- Modulation (DSM) 
 
Double-Side-Modulation (DSM) 
With DSM scheme, during an idle condition (no audio 
signal applied), both VOPL/R and VONL/R outputs are 
at 50% duty cycle and in phase with each other, 
resulting in little or no current flowing through the 
speaker. When a positive audio input is applied, the 
duty cycle of VOPL/R is greater than 50% and VONL/R 
is less than 50%, resulting in a positive current flowing 
through the speaker. When a negative audio input is 
applied, the duty cycle of VOPL/R is less than 50% and 
VONL/R is greater than 50%, resulting in a negative 
current flowing through the speaker. Compared with the 
traditional modulation scheme, the DSM scheme 
reduces the switching current, which minimizes any I2R 
losses in the speaker load and eliminates the need for 
an LC output filter for most applications.  
Single-Side-Modulation (SSM) 
The SSM scheme alters the DSM scheme in order to 
achieve higher efficiency with a slight penalty in THD 
degradation and more attention required for the 
selection of the output filter. With SSM scheme, the 
audio outputs operate with less than 10% modulation 
during an idle condition. When an audio signal is 
applied, one output will decrease and another one will 
increase. The decreasing output signal will quickly rail 
to ground at which point all the audio modulation takes 
place through the rising output. The result is that only 
one output is switching during a majority of the audio 
cycle. Efficiency is improved with SSM scheme due to 
the reduction of switching losses. The THD penalty with 
SSM scheme is minimized by the on-chip linear 
feedback loop.

Volume Fade-In and Fade-Out 
The SGM4700 features volume fade-in and fade-out to 
reduce intermittent sound and eliminate uncomfortable 
hearing experience during the transitions when the 
device enters or exits the normal operation. Figure 9 
and Figure 10 show the audio output waveforms during

PBTL Configuration (Mono Mode) 
The SGM4700 features an optional mono mode that 
allows the left and right channels to operate in parallel 
BTL configuration. To operate the SGM4700 in mono 
mode, connect the INNR and INPR pins (pin 11 and 12) 
directly to ground (no decoupling capacitors). In mono 
mode, as shown in Figure 11, an audio input signal 
applied to the left channel (pin 3 and 4) is routed to the 
H-bridge of both channels. Note that the mono mode is 
intended to be configured strictly by the hardware 
connection. Leaving either INNR or INPR pin 
unconnected while the audio outputs VOPL/R and 
VONL/R are wired together in PBTL configuration can 
trigger an over-current or thermal overload protection or 
both. The mono mode is configured by the following 
arrangement:  
● Connect INPR and INNR pins directly to ground (no 
decoupling capacitors). 
● Connect VOPL to VONL together as one terminal of 
the speaker and connect VOPR to VONR together 
as the other terminal of the speaker. Use heavy 
PCB traces as close as possible to the device.  
● Place the speaker between the left and right-channel 
outputs.  
● Apply an audio signal to the left-channel inputs 
(INPL and INNL pins).

Click-and-Pop Suppression 
The SGM4700 features comprehensive click-and-pop 
suppression. 
During 
startup, 
the 
click-and-pop 
suppression circuitry reduces any audible transients 
internal to the device. When entering into shutdown, 
the differential audio outputs VOPL/R and VONL/R 
ramp down to ground simultaneously.  
PSRR Enhancement 
Without a dedicated pin for the common-mode voltage 
bias and an external holding capacitor onto the pin, the 
SGM4700 achieves a PSRR, 80dB at 1kHz with SSM 
scheme.

APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued) 
Startup and Shutdown 
The SGM4700 requires a power-up sequence (see 
Figure 12). Please hold EN low at least 10ms after 
PVDD and AVDD supply voltages are turned on. 
The SGM4700 employs the EN pin to minimize power 
consumption when not in use. When the EN pin is 
pulled low, the SGM4700 is forced into shutdown mode. 
At this time, all the analog circuitry is de-biased and the 
supply current is reduced to the minimum level, and the 
differential outputs are shorted to ground through an 
on-chip resistor (5kΩ) individually. Once in shutdown 
mode, the EN pin must remain low for at least 10ms (tSD) 
for the shutdown settling time before it can be pulled 
high again. When the EN pin is asserted high, the 
device exits out of shutdown mode and enters into 
normal operation after the startup time (tSTARTUP) of 
45ms. 
An on-chip pull-down resistor of 250kΩ is included onto 
the EN pin. Thus, shutdown mode is the state when the 
power supply is first applied to the device. Whenever 
possible, please hold the EN pin low until the device is 
properly powered up and the audio signals at the inputs 
are stable. Also, for best power-off pop performance, 
place the device in shutdown mode prior to removing 
the power supply voltage.  
Note that the setting at the MODS pin is latched during 
startup and cannot be changed while the device is in 
operation. To change the setting of the MODS pin, the 
device must be first brought into shutdown mode by 
pulling the EN pin low for at least 10ms before it can be 
restored to its normal operation.

Protection Modes 
For safe operation, the SGM4700 incorporates 
comprehensive protection circuits against various 
operating faults including Under-Voltage, Over-Voltage, 
Over-Current, Over-Temperature, and DC-Detect, as 
described in Table 7. In the shutdown mode, all the 
analog circuitry is de-biased with differential outputs to 
be shorted to ground. In the mute mode, all the analog 
circuitry is enabled with differential outputs to be 
shorted to ground.  
Under-Voltage Lockout (UVLO) 
The SGM4700 incorporates circuitry to detect a low 
supply voltage for safe and reliable operation. When 
the supply voltage is first applied, the SGM4700 will 
remain inactive until the supply voltage exceeds 4.6V 
(VUVLOUP). When the supply voltage is removed and 
drops below 4.3V (VUVLODN), the SGM4700 enters into 
mute mode, where the differential audio outputs 
VOPL/R and VONL/R are pulled to ground through 
on-chip resistors (5kΩ) individually.  
Over-Voltage Protection (OVP) 
The SGM4700 features over-voltage protection. When 
the supply voltage exceeds 24.5V (VOVPUP), the device 
enters into mute mode, where the differential audio 
outputs VOPL/R and VONL/R are pulled to ground 
through on-chip resistors (5kΩ) individually. The device 
will resume normal operation once the supply voltage 
returns to a value lower than 23V (VOVPDN).  
Over-Temperature Shutdown (OTSD)  
When the die temperature exceeds +160℃, the device 
enters into mute mode, where the differential audio 
outputs VOPL/R and VONL/R are pulled to ground 
through on-chip resistors (5kΩ) individually. The device 
will resume normal operation once the die temperature 
returns to a lower temperature, which is about 20℃ 
lower than the threshold.  
 
DC-Detect Protection (DCP) 
The SGM4700 features DCP circuit to protect the 
speakers from large DC current. A DC-detect fault is 
issued when the duty cycle of differential outputs of 
either channel exceeds 20% for more than 720ms at 
the same polarity. The device enters into mute mode, 
where the differential audio outputs VOPL/R and 
VONL/R are pulled to ground through on-chip resistors 
(5kΩ) individually. Note that the DCP threshold is a 
function of the supply voltage, as shown in Table 8. To 
avoid nuisance faults due to the DCP circuit, it is 
recommended to hold the EN pin low during startup 
until the audio signals at the inputs are stable. Also, 
take care to closely match the impedance seen at two 
differential inputs. 
A DC-detect fault is latched and reported on the 
FAULTB pin as a low state. Also, the SGM4700 enters 
into mute mode and remains in mute mode. The latch 
can be cleared by cycling the EN pin through the low 
state. 
Over-Current Protection (OCP) 
In operation, the outputs of Class-D amplifiers are 
constantly monitors for any over-current and/or 
short-circuit conditions. When a short-circuit condition 
between two differential outputs, differential outputs to 
PVDD or ground is detected, the device enters into 
mute mode, where the differential audio outputs 
VOPL/R and VONL/R are pulled to ground through 
on-chip resistors (5kΩ) individually. If the fault persists 
over a prescribed period, the fault condition is latched 
and reported on the FAULTB pin as a low state. Also, 
the SGM4700 enters into mute mode and remains in 
mute mode. The latch can be cleared by cycling the EN 
pin through the low state. 
If automatic recovery from the OCP fault is desired, 
connect the FAULTZ pin directly to the EN pin, as shown 
in Figure 13. It allows the FAULTZ pin to automatically 
drive the EN pin low, which clears the OCP latch.

Class-D Audio Amplifier 
The audio power amplifiers in SGM4700 operate in 
much the same way as traditional Class-D amplifiers 
and similarly offer much higher power efficiency.  
Fully Differential Amplifier 
The SGM4700 includes a pair of fully differential 
amplifiers with differential inputs and outputs. The fully 
differential amplifiers ensure that the differential output 
voltages are equal to the differential input voltages 
times the amplifier gain. Although the SGM4700 
supports for a single-ended input, differential inputs are 
much preferred for applications where the environment 
can be noisy in order to ensure maximum SNR.  
Low-EMI Filterless Output Stage  
Traditional Class-D audio amplifiers require for the use 
of external LC filters, or shielding, to meet EN55022B 
electromagnetic-interference (EMI) regulation standards. 
The SGM4700 applies an edge-rate control circuitry to 
reduce EMI emissions, while maintaining high power 
efficiency.  
Filterless Design 
The SGM4700 does not require an output filter. The 
device relies on the inherent inductance of the speaker 
coil and the natural filtering of both the speaker and the 
human ear to recover the audio component of the 
square-wave output. By eliminating the output filter, a 
smaller, less costly, and more efficient solution can be 
accomplished.  
Because the frequency of the audio outputs is well 
beyond the bandwidth of most speakers, voice coil 
movement due to the square-wave frequency is very 
small. Although this movement is small, a speaker not 
designed to handle the additional power can be 
damaged. For optimum performance, use speakers 
with series inductances greater than 10μH. Typical 4Ω 
speakers exhibit series inductances from 10μH to 
47μH.  
Ferrite Bead Output Filter 
With an edge-rate control circuitry in SGM4700, it is 
possible to design a low EMI, highly efficient Class-D 
audio amplifier without the need for classic LC 
reconstruction filters when the amplifier drives speaker 
loads with short speaker wires (less than 10cm). 
However, EMI suppression can be further reduced by 
use of a low-cost ferrite bead filter comprising a ferrite 
bead and a capacitor, as shown in Figure 14. The 
ferrite bead filter is applied to block radiation in the 
range of 30MHz and above from appearing on the 
speaker wires and the power supply lines. The 
impedance of the ferrite bead is used with a small 
capacitor in the range of 1nF to reduce the frequency 
spectrum of the signal to an acceptable level. For best 
performance, the resonant frequency of the ferrite bead 
filter should be less than 10MHz.

Figure 14. Ferrite Bead Filter for EMI Reduction 
Choose a ferrite bead with low DC resistance (DCR) 
and high impedance (100Ω ~ 330Ω) at high frequencies 
(>100MHz). The current flowing through the ferrite 
bead must be also taken into consideration. The 
effectiveness of ferrites can be greatly aggravated at 
much lower than their rated current values. Choose a 
ferrite bead with a rated current no less than 3A for 8Ω 
loads, 5A for 4Ω loads, and 7A for 3Ω loads (in PBTL 
configuration).

APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued) 
A high quality ceramic capacitor is needed for the ferrite 
bead filter. A low ESR ceramic capacitor with good 
temperature and voltage characteristics will be the best 
choice. The capacitor value varies based on the ferrite 
bead chosen and the actual speaker lead length. It is 
crucial to place each ferrite bead filter tightly together 
and individually close to VOPL/R and VONL/R pins 
respectively. 
Additional EMI improvements may be obtained by 
adding snubber networks from each of the Class-D 
outputs to ground. Suggested values for a simple RC 
series snubber network are 10Ω in series with a 680pF 
capacitor. Note that design of the RC snubber circuit is 
specific to every application and must take into account 
the parasitic reactance of the system board to reach 
proper values of R and C. Evaluate and ensure that the 
voltage spikes (overshoots and undershoots) at 
VOPL/R and VONL/R on the actual system board are 
within their absolute maximum ratings. Pay close 
attention to the layout of the RC snubber circuit to be 
tight and individually close to VOPL/R and VONL/R 
pins, respectively. 
 
LC Output Filter 
For applications with nearby highly noise sensitive 
circuits or long speaker wires, it may become necessary 
to add an LC reconstruction filter for best EMI reduction. 
A classic second-order low-pass filter, as shown in 
Figure 15, can be used for the output filter.

Figure 15. LC Output Filter for EMI Reduction 
In Figure 15, the corner frequency of the LC low-pass 
filter, as given by Equation 3, must be designed to be 
sufficiently high to allow for high-frequency components 
of audio signals, yet be low enough to sufficiently 
attenuate high-frequency components of the audio 
outputs from VOPL/R and VONL/R. The corner 
frequency of the filter is typically set about 50kHz. In 
Equation 3, it is assumed that L = L1 = L2, CG = C2 = C3, 
and C = 2 × C1 + CG.

The quality factor Q of the output filter is important. 
Lower Q increases output noise and higher Q results in 
passband peaking at frequencies near the corner 
frequency. The quality factor of the filter is typically set 
between 0.5 and 0.8. As shown in Equation 4, the 
speak load, RLOAD, affects the quality factor of the filter.

Audio Input Capacitors (CINL1, CINL2, CINR1 
and CINR2) 
The input DC decoupling capacitors are recommended 
to bias the incoming audio inputs to a proper DC level. 
The input capacitor CIN, in conjunction with the amplifier 
input resistance (including both internal resistor RINI 
and external resistor RINE, if any) forms a high-pass 
filter that removes the DC bias of the audio inputs. The 
corner frequency fC,HPF of the high-pass filter is given by 
Equation 5. In the equation, it is assumed that RINE = 
RINL1 = RINL2 = RINR1 = RINR2 and CIN = CINL1 = CINL2 = 
CINR1 = CINR2.

RINE is the external input resistance for a specific 
voltage gain. Note that the variation of the actual input 
resistance will affect the voltage gain proportionally. 
Choose RINE with a tolerance of 2% or better.  
Choose CIN such that fC,HPF is well below the lowest 
frequency of interest. Setting it too high affects the 
amplifiers’ low-frequency response. Consider an 
example where the specification calls for AV = 26dB 
and fC,HPF = 5Hz. In this example, RINE = 0Ω and RINI = 
30kΩ and CIN is calculated to be about 1.06μF; thus 
1μF, as a common choice of capacitance, can be 
chosen for CIN.  
Any mismatch in capacitance between two audio inputs 
will cause a mismatch in the corner frequencies. 
Severe mismatch may also cause turn-on pop noise, 
PSRR, CMRR performance. Choose CIN with a 
tolerance of ±2% or better.  
Furthermore, the type of the input capacitor is crucial to 
audio quality. For best audio quality, use capacitors 
whose dielectrics have low-voltage coefficients, such 
as tantalum or aluminum electrolytic. Capacitors with 
high-voltage coefficients, such as ceramics, may result 
in increased distortion at low frequencies.  
Supply Coupling Capacitors (CPVDD, CAVDD, 
CGVDD and CPLIMIT) 
Decouple each pair of PVDD pins respectively with a 
1μF low-ESR ceramic capacitor (X7R or X5R) to GND. 
It is highly suggested to add an additional 0.01μF 
ceramic capacitor, in tandem with each 1μF capacitor, 
for high-frequency decoupling. The rated voltage of the 
supply coupling capacitors must be higher than the 
power supply voltage with sufficient tolerance to limit 
the effects of DC bias. Place the decoupling capacitors 
as individually close as possible to each pair of PVDD 
pins.  
If the power supply input is located more than a few 
inches 
from 
SGM4700, 
additional 
bulk 
supply 
decoupling capacitors (electrolytic or tantalum type) 
may be required. Add a large (220μF or greater) bulk 
capacitor on the PVDD power bus in close proximity to 
the SGM4700.  
Decouple the AVDD pin with a 1μF low-ESR ceramic 
capacitor to AGND. Place the decoupling capacitor as 
close as possible to the AVDD pin. Furthermore, add a 
small decoupling resistor (RAVDD) of 10Ω between the 
system power supply and the AVDD pin, preventing 
high-frequency transients of PVDD from interfering with 
on-chip linear amplifiers.  
Decouple the GVDD pin with a 1μF low-ESR ceramic 
capacitor to AGND. Place the decoupling capacitor 
close to the GVDD pin.  
Decouple the PLIMIT pin with a 0.1μF low-ESR 
ceramic capacitor to AGND for high-frequency filtering. 
Place the decoupling capacitor close to the PLIMIT pin.

PCB LAYOUT 
As a high power, high efficiency, Class-D stereo audio 
power amplifier, the SGM4700 requires proper PCB 
layout and grounding to ensure high efficiency, low 
distortion, and low EMI emission. Use wide traces for 
the power supply inputs (PVDD) and audio outputs 
(VOPL/R and VONL/R) to minimize losses due to 
parasitic trace resistances. Route all traces that carry 
switching 
transients 
away 
from 
the 
traces 
or 
components in the audio signal path.  
Ground Plane – It is required to use a solid metal 
plane with sufficiently wide area as a central ground 
GND for SGM4700. All the power ground pins PGND 
are directly shorted to the large ground plane GND, 
which serves as a central “star” ground for the 
SGM4700. Use a single point of connection between 
the analog ground AGND and the ground plane GND to 
minimize the coupling of high-current switching noise 
onto audio signals.  
Supply Decoupling Capacitors – The supply 
decoupling capacitors (CPVDD and CAVDD) should be 
placed as individually close as possible to PVDD and 
AVDD pins.  
 
Output Filters – Place each audio output filter (ferrite 
bead or LC filter) individually close to their respective 
output pins, VOPL/R and VONL/R, for best EMI 
performance and operational robustness. Keep the 
current loop from each of the audio outputs through the 
output filters and back to the PGND pins as short and 
tight as possible.  
Power Dissipation – The maximum output power of 
SGM4700 can be severely limited by its thermal 
dissipation capability. To ensure the device operating 
properly and reliably at maximum output power without 
incurring over-temperature shutdown, the following 
guidelines are given for best thermal dissipation 
capability:  
● Fill both top and bottom layers of the system board 
with solid GND metal traces.  
● Solder the thermal pad directly onto a grounded 
metal plane.  
● Place lots of equally-spaced vias underneath the 
thermal pad connecting the top and bottom layers of 
GND. The vias are connected to a solid metal plane 
on the bottom layer of the board.  
● Reserve wide and uninterrupted areas along the 
thermal flow on the top layer, i.e., no wires cutting 
through the GND layer and obstructing the thermal 
flow.   
● Avoid using vias for traces carrying high current.
