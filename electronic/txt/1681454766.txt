GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM48013C is a high-speed gate driver capable 
of effectively driving MOSFET and IGBT power 
switches. It allows for up to 8A source and 13A sink 
peak currents at VDD = 20V. The SGM48013C provides 
a comprehensive set of protection features such as 
thermal shutdown protection and under-voltage lockout. 
It operates with a wide supply range of 4.5V to 20V. 
The SGM48013C is available in a Green SOT-23-5 
package. It operates over a temperature range of -40℃ 
to +125℃.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.
