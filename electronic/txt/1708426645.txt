DECEMBER 2023 – REV. A 
GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM42403Q consists of four identical low-side 
drivers with over-current protection. It has integrated 
diodes to discharge the inductive load energy such as 
unipolar stepper motors, DC motors, relays, solenoids 
or other loads when output is turned off. 
The SGM42403Q can provide continuous output 
current up to 2A (1-channel on) or 1.1A/CH (4-channel 
on) by the TSSOP package at +25℃. 
The device has multiple protection functions, including 
under-voltage lockout, over-current, short-circuit protection 
and 
thermal 
shutdown. 
Over-current 
and 
over- 
temperature can be reported by the nFAULT pin. 
This device is AEC-Q100 qualified (Automotive 
Electronics Council Standard Q100 Grade 1) and the 
use of this device is suitable for automotive 
applications. 
The SGM42403Q is available in a Green TSSOP-16A 
(Exposed Pad) package.

NOTES:  
1. The absolute maximum ratings of VM, VOUTx and VCLAMP at 
-40℃ is -0.3V to 50V. 
2. VCLAMP is not a power supply and is only used to supply the 
power to clamp diodes. 
 
OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

Motor Voltage 
The motor voltage used depends on the application 
requirements. Higher voltage will generate more 
current and torque, and using higher voltage can also 
make the motor run faster than low voltage. 
Drive Current 
There is a current path from the power supply to the 
motor winding and low-side MOSFET. For the power 
dissipation on the MOSFET, please refer to calculation 
below: 
P = I2 × RDSON                (1) 
The SGM42403Q can support up to 2A (1-channel on) 
or 1.1A/channel (4-channel on simultaneously) at 
+25℃. The maximum continuous current depends on 
PCB layout and ambient temperature.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
Overview 
The SGM42403Q is a quad industrial low-side switch. 
Each output is controlled by its individual input. And the 
low-side MOSFET has a low RDSON of typically 350mΩ. 
The four switches are pin controlled, allowing parallel 
interface and high switching rates of over 100kHz on 
each channel. The maximum load current allowed 
through the switch can be set to fit different system 
requirements. The outputs are protected against 
short-circuit and thermal overload. The internal active 
clamp limits the OUTx voltage to VCLAMP, enabling fast 
turn-off of the inductive loads.  
 
Output Drivers 
The SGM42403Q integrates four low-side MOSFETs. 
Each MOSFET is protected by its own over-current 
protection circuit. And all the four outputs are 
connected to VCLAMP pin through the integrated 
diodes. The VCLAMP can be shorted to power supply 
(VM pin) directly. Also, a Zener or TVS can be put 
between VM and VCLMAP pins, this connection is used 
when current fast decay is needed. However, if using 
this connection, it is necessary to make sure that the 
output voltage should not go beyond the maximum 
rating of output pin. 
 
Protection Circuits 
The SGM42403Q device is fully protected against 
over-current, over-temperature and under-voltage events. 
 
Over-Current Protection (OCP) 
Each MOSFET is protected by its own over-current limit. 
In case of an over-current (if the current limit lasts 
longer than OCP deglitch time), all the four output 
MOSFETs will be turned off, the nFAULT pin will be 
driven low, and the device will retry after about 10ms. 
 
Thermal Shutdown (TSD) 
If a junction over-temperature occurs in the device, the 
nFAULT pin will be driven low and all outputs are 
shutdown. Once the temperature goes back to the safe 
level, the device resumes its operation. 
 
Under-Voltage Lockout (UVLO) 
If the voltages on VM pin fall below under-voltage 
lockout threshold, the device will be disabled, and 
internal logic will be reset. Device resumes its operation 
when VM goes back above its UVLO threshold. 
Parallel Interface Operation 
Paralleling the outputs is used for higher current 
applications, please refer to SGM42403Q control 
interface in Figure 5.

Figure 5. Parallel Interface Operation 
 
nENBL and RESET Operation 
The nENBL pin is active-low and is pulled down 
internally. 
The RESET pin is active-high. If RESET pin is pulled to 
high, the internal logic is reset, outputs are turned off, 
and input control signal on INx pin is ignored. RESET 
pin is pulled down internally.
