GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The 74HC373 is an 8-bit D-type transparent latch with 
3-state outputs that is designed for 2.0V to 5.5V VCC 
operation. 
The device is provided with a latch enable (LE) input 
and an output enable (OE
ത
ത
ത
ത
ത) input. When LE is set high, 
data at the inputs gets access to the latches and the 
latches are transparent, the latch outputs will vary with 
corresponding data inputs. When LE is set low, the 
latches store data that appeared on the inputs for a 
setup time before the high-to-low transition of LE. When 
OE
ത
ത
ത
ത
ത is high, all outputs are in high-impedance state. OE
ത
ത
ത
ത
ത 
has no influence on the state of the latches.  
The clamp diodes of inputs allow the use of current 
limiting resistors to connect inputs to the voltage 
exceeding supply voltage. 
The 74HC373 is available in Green SOIC-20 and 
TSSOP-20 packages. It operates over an ambient 
temperature range of -40℃ to +125℃.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
1. Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may 
affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
2. The input and output voltage ratings may be exceeded if the 
input and output clamp current ratings are observed. 
3. The performance capability of a high-performance integrated 
circuit in conjunction with its thermal environment can create 
junction temperatures which are detrimental to reliability. 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.
