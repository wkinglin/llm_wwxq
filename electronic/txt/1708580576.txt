DECEMBER 2023 – REV. A
GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM61410Q is a high frequency, synchronous 
Buck converter with integrated switches. It can deliver 
up to 600mA to the output over a wide input voltage 
range of 5V to 42V. The low 14µA quiescent current 
and ultra-low shutdown current of only 0.6µA make it a 
suitable choice for battery-powered applications. 
SGM61410Q features high efficiency over a wide load 
range achieved by scaling down the switching 
frequency at light loads to reduce switching and gate 
driving 
losses. 
Other 
features 
include 
internal 
compensation, internal monotonic soft-start even with 
pre-biased output and fast loop response due to the 
peak-current mode controller. 
Protection features include current limiting and short- 
circuit protection, thermal shutdown with auto recovery 
and output over-voltage protection. Frequency fold-back 
helps prevent inductor current runaway during startup.  
This SGM61410Q is AEC-Q100 qualified (Automotive 
Electronics Council Standard Q100 Grade 1) and the 
use of this device is suitable for automotive 
applications. 
SGM61410Q is available in a Green SOT-23-6 
package.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

PIN DESCRIPTION 
PIN 
NAME 
FUNCTION 
1 
BOOT 
Bootstrap Pin. It is used to provide a drive voltage, which is higher than the input voltage, to the 
topside power switch. Place a 0.47µF Boost capacitor (CBOOT) as close as possible to the IC 
between this pin and SW pin. 
2 
GND 
Ground Pin. It is the reference for input and the regulated output voltages. Special layout 
considerations are required. 
3 
FB 
Feedback Pin for Programming the Output Voltage. The SGM61410Q regulates the FB pin to 
0.765V (TYP). Connect the feedback resistor divider tap to this pin. If the FB voltage exceeds 
117% of 0.765V, over-voltage protection (OVP) will stop all PWM switching. 
4 
EN 
Enable Pin. It should not be left open and should not be driven above VIN + 0.3V. Device will 
operate when the EN pin is high and shut down when the EN pin is low. EN must be tied to VIN 
pin via a resistor if the shutdown feature is not required or to a logic input for controlling shutdown. 
5 
VIN 
VIN Pin. It is connected to the input supply voltage and powers the internal control circuitry. This 
voltage is monitored by a UVLO lockout comparator. VIN is also connected to the drain of the 
converter top switch. Due to power switching, this pin has high di/dt transition edges and must be 
decoupled to the GND by input capacitors as close as possible to the GND pin to minimize the 
parasitic inductances. 
6 
SW 
Switching Node Pin. It is the output of the internal power converter and should be connect to the 
output inductor. Bootstrap capacitor also connects to this pin. This node should be kept small on 
the PCB to minimize capacitive coupling, noise coupling and radiation.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
Overview 
The SGM61410Q is an internally compensated wide 
input range current mode controlled synchronous Buck 
converter. It is designed for high reliability and is 
particularly suitable for power conditioning from 
unregulated sources or battery-powered applications 
that need low sleep/shutdown currents. It also features a 
power-save mode in which operating frequency is 
adaptively reduced under light load conditions to reduce 
switching and gate losses and keep high efficiency. At 
no load and with switching stopped, the total operating 
current is approximately 14μA. If the device is disabled, 
the total consumption is typically 0.6μA. 
Figure 2 shows the simplified block diagram of the 
SGM61410Q. The two integrated MOSFET switches of 
the power stage are both over-current protected and 
can provide up to 600mA of continuous current for the 
load. Current limiting of the switches also prevents 
inductor current runaway. The converter switches are 
optimized for high efficiency at low duty cycle. 
At the beginning of each switching cycle, the high-side 
switch is turned on. This is the time that feedback 
voltage (VFB) is below the reference voltage (VREF) and 
power must be delivered to the output. After the 
on-period, the high-side switch is turned off and the 
low-side switch is turned on until the end of switching 
cycle. 
For 
reliable 
operation 
and 
preventing 
shoot-through, a short dead time is always inserted 
between gate pulses of the converter complimentary 
switches. During dead time, both switch gates are kept 
off. 
If the junction temperature exceeds a maximum 
threshold (TSD, typically +150℃), thermal shutdown 
protection will occur and switching will stop. The device 
will automatically recover with soft-start when the 
junction temperature drops back well below the trip 
point. This hysteresis is typically 20℃. 
The SGM61410Q has current limit on both the 
high-side and low-side MOSFET switches. When 
current limit is activated, frequency fold-back is also 
activated. This occurs in the case of output overload or 
short-circuit. Note that SGM61410Q will continue to 
provide its maximum output current and will not shut 
down or hiccup. In such a case, the junction 
temperature may rise rapidly and trigger thermal 
shutdown. 
During initial power-up of the device (soft-start), current 
limit and frequency fold-back are activated to prevent 
inductor current runaway while the output capacitor is 
charging to the desired VOUT. 
 
Peak-Current Mode (PWM Control) 
Figure 2 shows the functional block diagram and Figure 
3 shows the switching node operating waveforms of the 
SGM61410Q. Switching node voltage is generated by 
controlling the duty cycles of the complementary 
high-side and low-side switches. The high-side duty 
cycle is used as control parameter of the Buck 
converter to regulate output voltage and is defined as: 
D = tON/tSW, where tON is the high-side switch on-time 
and tSW is the switching period. When high-side switch 
is turned on, the SW pin voltage sharply rises towards 
VIN, and the inductor current (IL) starts ramping up with 
(VIN - VOUT)/L slope. When high-side switch is turned off, 
the low-side switch is turned on after a very short dead 
time to avoid shoot-through, and IL ramps down with 
-VOUT/L slope. In ideal case, the output voltage is 
proportional to the input voltage and duty cycle (D = 
VOUT/VIN) if component parasitic parameters are ignored. 
The SGM61410Q employs fixed-frequency peak-current 
mode control in continuous conduction mode (when 
inductor minimum current is above zero). In light load 
conditions (when the inductor current reaches zero), 
the SGM61410Q will enter discontinuous conduction 
mode and the control mode will change to shift 
frequency, peak-current mode to reduce the switching 
frequency and the associated switching and gate 
driving losses (power-save mode).

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
In continuous conduction mode, SGM61410Q operates 
at fixed-frequency using peak-current mode control 
scheme. The controller has an outer voltage feedback 
loop to get accurate DC voltage regulation. The output 
of the outer loop is fed to an inner peak-current control 
loop as reference command that adjusts the peak- 
current of the inductor. The inductor peak-current is 
sensed from the high-side switch and is compared to 
the peak-current reference to control the duty cycle. In 
other words, as soon as the inductor current reaches 
the reference peak-current determined by voltage loop, 
the high-side switch is turned off and the low-side 
switch is turned on after dead time. 
The internally compensated voltage feedback loop 
allows 
for 
simpler 
design 
and 
fewer 
external 
components. 
 
Power-Save Mode 
When the load is reduced, the inductor minimum (valley) 
current eventually reaches zero level (boundary condition). 
Synchronous rectifier (low-side switch) current is 
always sensed and when it reaches zero, the controller 
turns off the low-side switch and does not let the 
low-side switch sink current. This prevents inductor 
current from going below zero (negative). This results 
in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) operation in 
which inductor current remains zero until next switching 
cycle. Both switches are off during this period and do 
not act as complementary switches. This off-time will 
extend (that means lower frequency) until output 
voltage falls below reference voltage again and triggers 
a new switching cycle. With a new cycle, the high-side 
switch is turned on again for almost the same tON time 
as CCM. Therefore, the output capacitors take almost 
the same charge in each cycle and it will take longer 
off-times with lighter loads until output capacitor voltage 
falls below the reference voltage. The extended 
off-times mean lower switching frequency that is called 
frequency fold-back and significantly reduces the 
switching losses, but usually increases the output ripple 
a little bit. 
Note that the on-time of synchronous rectifier switch 
should always be long enough to fully charge the 
bootstrap 
capacitor 
and 
prevent 
bootstrap 
under-voltage lockout due to insufficient voltage for the 
high-side switch gate driver. 
Floating Driver and Bootstrap Charging 
UVLO Protection 
The high-side MOSFET driver is powered by a floating 
supply provided by an external bootstrap capacitor. The 
bootstrap capacitor is charged and regulated to about 
5V by the dedicated internal bootstrap regulator. When 
the voltage between BOOT and SW nodes is below 
regulation, a PMOS pass transistor turns on and 
connects VIN and BOOT pins internally, otherwise it 
will turn off. The power supply for the floating driver has 
its own UVLO protection. The rising UVLO threshold is 
about 4.7V and with 370mV hysteresis, and the falling 
threshold is about 4.3V. In case of UVLO, the reference 
voltage of the controller is reset to zero and after 
recovery a new soft-start process will start. 
 
Output Over-Voltage Protection (OVP) 
The SGM61410Q contains an over-voltage comparator 
that monitors the FB pin voltage. The over-voltage 
threshold is approximately 117% of nominal FB voltage. 
When the voltage at the FB pin exceeds the 
over-voltage threshold (VOUT_OV), PWM switching will 
be stopped and both high-side and low-side switches 
will be turned off. If the over-voltage fault is removed, 
the regulator will automatically recover. 
The error amplifier is normally able to maintain 
regulation since the synchronous output stage has 
excellent sink and source capability. However, it is not 
able to regulate output when the FB pin is disconnected 
or when the output is shorted to a higher supply like 
input supply. Also when VOUT is set to its minimum 
(0.765V) usually there is no voltage divider and VOUT is 
directly connected to FB through a resistor (R1 in the 
divider) and there is no resistor to ground (no R2). In 
such case and with no load, an internal current source 
of 5μA ~ 6μA from BOOT into the SW pin, which can 
slowly charge the output capacitor and pull VOUT up to 
VIN. Therefore, a minimum load of at least 10μA must 
be always present on VOUT (a 76.8kΩ resistor is 
preferred). 
If the FB pin is disconnected, a tiny internal current 
source will force the voltage at the FB pin to rise above 
VOUT_OV that triggers over-voltage protection and 
disables the regulator to protect the loads from a 
significant over-voltage. Also, if by accident a higher 
external voltage is shorted to the output, VFB will rise 
above the over-voltage threshold and trigger an OVP 
event to protect the low-side switch.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Minimum High-side On/Off-Time and 
Frequency Fold-Back 
The shortest duration for the high-side switch on-time 
(tON_MIN) is 95ns (TYP). For the off-time (tOFF_MIN), the 
minimum value is 85ns (TYP). The duty cycle (or 
equivalently the VOUT/VIN ratio) range in CCM operation 
is limited by tON_MIN and tOFF_MIN depending on the 
switching frequency. Note that at 1.2MHz the total cycle 
time is tSW = 833ns. 
The minimum and maximum duty cycles without 
frequency fold-back are given by Equations 1 and 2: 
DMIN = tON_MIN × fSW             (1) 
and 
DMAX = 1 - tOFF_MIN × fSW         (2) 
For any given output voltage, the highest input voltage

Input Voltage 
The SGM61410Q can operate efficiently for inputs as 
high as 42V. For CCM operation (continuous 
conduction mode) keep duty cycle between 11% and 
90%. 
 
Output Voltage 
The output voltage can be stepped down to as low as 
the 0.765V reference voltage (VREF). As explained 
before, when the output voltage is set to 0.765V and 
there is no voltage divider, a minimum small load will be 
needed. A 76.8kΩ resistor to ground will prevent the 
output voltage from floating. 
 
Soft-Start 
Soft-start is necessary to limit the input inrush current 
right after the device is powered up or enabled. 
Soft-start is implemented by slowly ramping up the 
reference voltage that in turn slowly ramps up the 
output voltage to its target regulation value. 
 
Enable 
EN pin turns the SGM61410Q operation on or off. If an 
applied voltage is less than 0.5V, the device will shut 
down. If the voltage is more than 1.2V, the device will 
start the regulator. The EN pin is an input and must not 
be left open. The simplest way to enable the device is 
to connect the EN pin to VIN pin via a resistor. This 
enables the SGM61410Q to start up automatically 
when VIN is within the operating range. An external 
logic signal can be used to drive the EN input for power 
savings, power supply sequencing and/or protection. If 
the EN pin is driven by an external logic signal, a 10kΩ 
resistor in series with the input is recommended. 
Note: Voltage on the EN pin should never exceed VIN + 
0.3V. Do not drive the EN pin with a logic level if VIN is 
not present. This can damage the EN pin and the 
device. 
 
Thermal Shutdown 
Thermal protection is designed to protect the die 
against 
overheating 
damage. 
If 
the 
junction 
temperature exceeds +150℃, the switching stops and 
the device shuts down. Automatic recovery with an 
internal soft-start will begin when the junction 
temperature drops below the +130℃ falling threshold.

The design method and component selection for the

Figure 4 and Figure 5. Only a few external components 
are needed to provide a constant output voltage from a 
wide input voltage range. 
The external components are designed based on the 
application requirements and device stability. Some

Design Requirements 
A typical application circuit for the SGM61410Q as a 
Buck converter is shown in Figure 4. It is used for 
converting a 6V to 42V supply voltage to a lower 
voltage level supply voltage (5V) suitable for the 
system. The design parameters given in Table 2 are 
used for this design example.

Output Voltage Programming 
Output voltage can be set with a resistor divider 
feedback network between output and FB pin as shown 
in Figure 4. Usually, a design is started by selecting 
lower resistor R2 and calculating R1 with the following

               (5)
 
where VREF = 0.765V. 
To keep operating quiescent current small and prevent 
voltage errors due to leakage currents, it is recommended 
to choose R2 in the range of 10kΩ to 100kΩ. 
If the output has no load other than the FB divider, 
make sure the divider draws at least 10μA from VOUT or 
an internal current source (5μA to 6μA) from BOOT to 
SW will slowly charge the output capacitor beyond the 
desired voltage.

APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued) 
Inductor Selection 
Higher operating frequency allows the designer to 
choose smaller inductor and capacitor values. However, 
the switching and gate losses are increased. On the 
other hand, at lower frequencies the current ripple (∆IL) 
is higher, which results in higher light load losses. Use 
Equation 6 to calculate the required inductance (LMIN). 
K is the ratio of the inductor peak-to-peak ripple (∆IL) to 
the maximum operating DC current (IOUT). The 
recommended selection range for K is between 0.2 and 
0.4. Choosing a higher K value reduces the selected 
inductance, but a too high K factor may result in 
insufficient slope compensation. The inductance is 
selected based on the desired peak-to-peak ripple 
current (ΔIL) for CCM. Equation 7 shows that ∆IL is 
inversely proportional to fSW × L and is increased at the 
maximum input voltage (VIN_MAX). Therefore, by 
accepting larger ∆IL values, smaller inductances can be 
chosen but the cost is higher output voltage ripple and 
increased core losses. 
Inductor peak-current should never exceed the 
saturation even in transients to avoid over-current 
protection. Also inductor RMS rating should always be 
larger than operating RMS current even at maximum 
ambient temperature.

Note that it is generally desired to choose a smaller 
inductance value to have faster transient response, 
smaller size, and lower DCR. On the other hand, if the 
inductance is too small, current ripple will increase 
which can trigger over-current protection. Larger 
inductor current ripple also implies larger output voltage 
ripple 
with 
the 
same 
output 
capacitors. 
For 
peak-current mode control, it is recommended to 
choose large current ripple, because controller 
comparator performs better with higher signal to noise 
ratio. So, for this design example, K = 0.4 is chosen, 
and the minimum inductor value is calculated to be 
15.3µH. The nearest standard value would be a 22µH 
ferrite inductor with a 1A RMS current rating and 1.5A 
saturation current that are well above the designed 
converter output current RMS and DC respectively. 
Bootstrap Capacitor Selection 
The SGM61410Q requires a small external bootstrap 
capacitor, CBOOT, between the BOOT and SW pins to 
provide the gate drive supply voltage for the high-side 
MOSFET. The bootstrap capacitor is refreshed when 
the high-side MOSFET is off and the low-side switch is 
conducted. An X7R or X5R 0.47µF ceramic capacitor 
with a voltage rating of 16V or higher is recommended 
for stable operating performance over-temperature and 
voltage variations. 
 
Input Capacitor Selection 
The input capacitor also provides the high frequency 
switching transient currents. So, choosing a low-ESR 
and small size capacitor with high self-resonance 
frequency and sufficient RMS rating is necessary. The 
recommended high frequency decoupling capacitor 
value is 10μF X5R or X7R or higher. It is recommended 
to choose the voltage rating of the capacitor(s) at least 
twice the maximum input voltage to avoid derating of 
the ceramic capacitors with DC voltage. Some bulk 
capacitances may be needed, especially if the 
SGM61410Q is not located within 5cm distance from 
the input voltage source for input stability. Bulk 
capacitors have high Equivalent Series Resistance 
(ESR) and can provide the damping needed to prevent 
input voltage spiking due to the wiring inductance of the 
input. The value for the input capacitor is not critical but 
must be rated to handle the maximum input voltage 
including ripple. For this design, one 10μF, X7R, 50V is 
selected for the input decoupling capacitor. To improve 
high frequency filtering, a small parallel 0.1μF capacitor 
may be placed as close as possible to the device pins. 
 
Output Capacitor Selection 
This device is designed to be used with external LC 
filters. The minimum required capacitance to keep cost 
and size down and bandwidth high. The main parts for 
designing the output capacitance are output voltage 
ripple, loop stability and the voltage over/undershoot 
during load current transients. So, COUT should be 
chosen carefully. The output voltage ripple is determined 
of two factors. One factor is caused by the inductor 
current ripple going through the ESR of the output 
capacitors: 
ΔVOUT_ESR = ΔIL × ESR = KIND × IOUT × ESR   (8)

These AC components are not in phase and the total 
peak-to-peak ripple is less than ΔVOUT_ESR + ΔVOUT_C. 
Transient performance specification usually limits 
output capacitance if the system requires tight voltage 
regulation in presence of large current steps and/or fast 
slew rate. The output capacitor must provide the 
increased load current or absorb the excess inductor 
current (when the load current steps down) until the 
control loop can re-adjust the current of the inductor to 
the new load level. The control loop of regulator usually 
requires 8 or more clock cycles to adjust the inductance 
current to the new load level. The output capacitance 
must be as large as possible to provide a current 
difference of 8 clock cycles to keep the output voltage 
within the specified range. Equation 10 shows the 
minimum output capacitance required to specify output 
over/undershoot.

where: 
IOL = Low level of the output current step during load

IOH = High level of the output current during load

VOUT_SHOOT = Target output voltage over/undershoot. 
For this design example, the target output ripple is 
25mV. Assuming ΔVOUT_ESR = ΔVOUT_C = 25mV, and 
choosing KIND = 0.4, Equation 8 requires ESR to be less 
than 104mΩ and Equation 9 requires COUT > 1μF. The 
target over/undershoot range of this design is 
ΔVOUT_SHOOT = 5% × VOUT = 250mV. From Equation 10, 
COUT > 8μF. So, in summary, the most stringent criteria 
for the output capacitor is transient constrain of COUT > 
8μF. For the derating margin, one 22μF, 10V, X7R 
ceramic capacitor with 10mΩ ESR is used. 
 
Layout Guideline 
Careful layout is always important to ensure good 
performance and stable operation to any kind of 
switching regulator. Place the capacitors close to the 
device, use the GND pin of the device as the center of 
star-connection to other grounds, and minimize the 
trace area of the SW node. With smaller transient 
current loops, lower parasitic ringing will be achieved. 
 Bypass VIN pin to GND pin with low-ESR ceramic 
capacitors (X5R or X7R better dielectric) placed as 
close as possible to VIN pin. 
 Use short, wide and direct traces for high-current 
connections (VIN, SW and GND). 
 Keep the BOOT-SW voltage path as short as 
possible. 
 Place the feedback resistors as close as possible to 
the FB pin that is sensitive to noise. 
 Minimize the area and path length of the loop 
formed by VIN pin, bypass capacitors connections 
and SW pin.
