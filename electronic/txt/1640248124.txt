GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM41100A is designed for primary protection of 
Li-Ion/polymer rechargeable cells. The product integrates 
all the protections required for safe operation of polymer 
rechargeable cells. The device is packaged in a tiny and 
thin package. Its small solution size leaves more space 
for fitting the battery cell into a given cavity for small size 
wearable devices. 
The SGM41100A integrates all the protections and the 
required low on-resistance disconnect switch on one 
die. The protection features include charge and 
discharge protection, detection and protection of a cell 
in charge over-voltage, charge over-current, discharge 
under-voltage and discharge over-current. The product 
also disconnects the battery pack in the case of deep 
discharge. 
The SGM41100A operates in -40℃ to +85℃ temperature 
range, and is in a thin and low profile UTDFN-1.5×2-6L 
package. This package with a nominal height of 0.5mm 
is convenient for small cell packing designs.

2. The clamping may reach 10mA at an input voltage > 13V. 
3. Test with a voltage regulated supply that has 2A current 
limit and increase the voltage progressively for less than 
1V/ms slope rate. Apply a voltage to the device under test 
from 0V to given voltages. 
4. The device is tested after being installed on the circuit 
board in Figure 1. Clip a 4.5V 5A power source onto the P 
and M to simulate a battery and short the Pack P and the 
Pack N with an 80mΩ wire. 
5. The device is tested after being installed on the circuit 
board in Figure 1. Connect a 3.2V supply and 2A sinking 
resistor RSINK as showed in Figure 2 to the P and M for inrush 
test. Clip a 4.5V 5A supply for outrush test. 
6. The device is tested after being installed on the circuit 
board in Figure 1 with the circuit in Figure 3. 
7. Parallel or connect in reverse polarity two battery packs of 
Figure 1. Limit the battery pack impedance to limit the surge 
current to 20A.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

PIN DESCRIPTION 
PIN 
NAME 
TYPE 
FUNCTION 
1 
PCKP 
P 
Power Input and Output, the Battery Pack Positive Connection. The default state after 
battery attached is closed or locked-off, dependent on the external circuitry. Connect 
a 200nF capacitor between PCKN pin and BATN pin for setting the default state to 
closed. It is recommended to connect a 0Ω resistor between PCKP pin and BYPS pin 
for suppressing noise applied to the PCKP input. 
2, 3 
PCKN 
P 
Power Input and Output, the Battery Pack Cathode. Short this pin to BATN pin to 
release off the locked-open state, and make the output path closed. 
4, 5 
BATN 
G 
Ground of Internal Circuit. Connect to the battery cathode end. 
6 
BYPS 
I/O 
Bypass Pin and Disconnection Locked-Off Triggering Input. Place a 1μF capacitor 
between this pin and BATN pin. Shorting this pin to PCKN pin momentarily places the 
circuit into locked-open state. 
Exposed 
Pad 
NC 
NC 
Not Connected Internally. It is recommended to connect to PCKN pin or BATN pin for 
benefiting ESD shielding or recovering from the over-current protection. The over-all 
leakage condition on a specific PCB board may have different effects on the recovery 
process. With this process, the on-board verification is a necessary proof of better 
connection. 
 
NOTE: I/O = Input or Output, G = Ground, P = Power for the Circuit, NC = Not Connected.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
The SGM41100A monitors voltage and current applied 
on battery cell connected between PCKP and BATN, 
and opens the connection between battery and pack 
terminal with its internal switches when a fault condition 
is detected. 
 
Voltage Related Protections 
When battery voltage reaches over-voltage threshold 
(VOV), the charge path is open-circuit. The path closes 
again when the charger voltage is lower than battery 
voltage and the battery voltage falls back about VOVHYS 
below the over-voltage threshold (VOV). 
In order to protect the battery from discharge 
under-voltage status when battery voltage falls below 
VUV for tUVPD or VSHDN instantly, the discharge path is 
open-circuit, the device enters into shutdown with only 
very low resistive leakage flowing into it, which helps to 
keep the battery from harmful exhausted condition as 
long as possible. The path closes again when a 
charging supply is applied and the battery voltage rises 
to about VUVHYS above the VUV threshold. 
Charge an exhausted battery: While the battery is 
over-discharged the battery could be in the following 
states. 
a) Battery voltage below 0.2V: Both charge and 
discharge paths are open-circuit. 
b) Battery voltage in the range of 0.2V to VSHDN: The 
battery is charged through the MOSFET body diode. 
c) Battery voltage in the range of VSHDN to VUV: The path 
switch is on for 144ms (tUVPD) in every 130ms and off 
for 2ms when charge current flows through the body 
diode. During this period, the charger will see the 
terminal voltage steps up/down. 
d) Battery voltage above under-voltage threshold: In this 
condition, the chip enters normal operation and 
charge and discharge modes are allowed. 
 
Current Related Protections 
When discharge over-current condition occurs and 
keeps for discharge over-current detection delay (tODD), 
the discharge path opens. The path closes again after 
tRETRY for retrying. 
During a charging condition if a charge over-current is 
identified, the SGM41100A enters the locked-off state. 
This state can be reset by charger removal (pack 
removal). 
Short-circuit protection: When discharge current 
exceeds 4 times or 3 times of the over-current threshold 
(4-times for _03/_05 options, 3-times for _09 option), 
discharge path disconnects instantly in tOCSD, in order to 
protect the battery from potential over-current stress. 
After this disconnection, the SGM41100A stays in the 
locked-off non-conducting state until being reactivated, 
or leakage condition pulls the PCKN potential off the 
PCKP's towards to the BATN potential when the load is 
fully detached off. 
Burst load outrush: In many systems, overload 
conditions will occur momentarily. The device allows for 
this short duration discharge condition by allowing the 
discharge path to remain closed even after a discharge 
over-current is detected for duration of discharge 
over-current detection delay. 
When a charge over-current condition is identified, and 
after charge over-current detection deglitch, the charge 
path is cut off. The device restores to the conducting 
state when the PCKP to PCKN voltage drops about 
3mV lower than the battery voltage. 
Parallel battery packs: When paralleling two battery 
packs utilizing SGM41100As, a momentary current 
surge may cause charge over-current protection in the 
pack with the lower voltage. The higher voltage pack 
can enter a discharge over-current protection. The 
charge over-current or discharge over-current protection 
resets only after the higher voltage battery pack 
discharges to a voltage slightly lower than the lower 
voltage pack. After this discharge both packs will 
conduct.  
It is highly recommended that the packs should be 
placed into a locked-open non-conducting state first (by 
connecting BYPS to PCKN momentarily) before being 
paralleled to avoid current overstress. When a charge 
supply is applied to the paralleled packs, the 
locked-open state will release.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Battery delivery state: It is recommended to deliver a 
battery pack in a locked-off non-conducting state to 
avoid unintentional shorting during production handling 
or transportation. The circuit of Figure 1 places the 
SGM41100A into a locked-off state after battery 
attachment by momentarily shorting BYPS and PCKN. 
Connecting a 220nF capacitor clapping between BATN 
and PCKN may place the device into conducting state, 
which might couple enough charge for making enough 
voltage difference between PCKN and PCKP for over 
about 1.3V. The voltage difference is the dividing result 
of the clapping capacitance and the load resistance and 
capacitance. The 220nF capacitance is recommended for 
no load condition. 
Pack activation: In order to release the pack from 
locked-off state and to place it into a conducting state, 
apply a charging input, or connect PCKN to BATN 
momentarily when there is no high load capacitance. 
Caution: The battery short or load side terminal short 
outside the protection circuit′s loop during battery 
attaching may cause excessive high surge current and 
excessive high current-breaking voltage surge, which 
may cause damage or degrade the life duration of 
battery and protection circuit. It is recorded that the 
accidental anode to ground plane shorting causes 
heavy surge, which can actually be avoided by leaving 
enough clearance around the anode pad on PCB or 
soldering/attaching the anode firstly in assembly (as the 
short between cathode to ground will not cause 
excessive surge). 
 
Surge, ESD and Reversed Attachment 
The SGM41100A absorbs voltage surge applied 
between PCKP and PCKN, by passing the surge 
current through its switch and the battery. Surge may 
occur when attaching the pack or battery cell. 
The SGM41100A survives either if a cell is placed in 
reverse or a charge input is attached in reverse, but not 
both at the same time. Any of these reverse 
attachments, short circuits, inrush surges and outrush 
will cause overstress. Do not test those cases in normal 
production inspection, as this kind of test itself may 
cause performance degradation or even damage the 
device. 
Caution about ESD damage to the battery: The 
battery pack might be the biggest element in equipment 
and induce much during an ESD event. Careful design 
of guided discharge path is desired for the equipment 
case sealing air-gap discharge over the battery and 
those connect to the battery closely. 
Caution on electrochemical corrosion: As a battery 
can apply potential over the electrodes continuously 
and cause electrochemical corrosion, the corrosion 
product may spread in the hollow beneath a surface 
mount device and cause leakage. Moisture-proof 
coating is recommended, especially when using 
compact devices. 
 
Cautions for Evaluation Test 
Some types of electronic load simulators may have 
excessive inrush current, and some BPM testers may 
have voltage transition surges, which may trigger the 
protection of the SGM41100A. Careful attention is 
required for doing such evaluations with these kinds of 
equipment. External voltage and current limits within 
the conditions specified in the Absolute Maximum 
Ratings section of this datasheet are required. 
 
Select Protection Parameters 
Battery models from different vendors may be 
customized for different applications. Consult the 
battery vendor for protection limits for specific battery 
model. 
Parameters for the protection circuit and of the charger 
circuit affecting same variables should be set for proper 
charge or discharge protection sequence. For example, 
the over-voltage threshold of the battery should be 
50mV ~ 100mV higher than constant voltage threshold 
of the charger. 
Cautions on parameter misalignment: If the VOV is 
lower than the full charge voltage of the battery charger, 
the protection circuit cuts off the battery charge path 
before the battery is fully charged, and turns into the 
non-conductive locked-off state; if the IOC is lower than 
the charge current, the protection circuit also turns itself 
into the locked-off state. In either VOV or IOC, the charger 
input should be removed and then reapplied for 
activating the protection circuit from the locked-off state 
to the conducting state. If the charger is not removed 
after a VOV or IOV event, the battery will not be charged 
even if the battery voltage is depleted.
