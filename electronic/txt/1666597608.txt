OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.

PIN DESCRIPTION 
PIN 
NAME 
FUNCTION 
1, 2 
OUT 
Regulator Output Pin. It is recommended to use a ceramic capacitor with effective capacitance in 
the range of 4μF to 100μF to ensure stability. This ceramic capacitor should be placed as close 
as possible to OUT pin. 
3 
FB 
Feedback Voltage Input Pin (adjustable voltage version only). Connect this pin to the midpoint of 
an external resistor divider to adjust the output voltage. Place the resistors as close as possible to 
this pin. 
SNS 
Output Voltage Sense Input Pin (fixed voltage version only). Connect this pin to the load side of 
the output trace only in the fixed voltage version. 
4 
GND 
Ground. 
5 
EN 
Enable Pin. Drive EN high to turn on the regulator. Drive EN low to turn off the regulator. The EN 
pin has an internal pull-down current source which ensures that the device is turned off when the 
EN pin is floated. This pin must be pulled high by an external resistor connected to IN pin if EN 
pin is not used. 
6 
NR 
Noise-Reduction Pin. Using an external capacitor CNR to decouple this pin to GND can not only 
reduce output noise to very low level but also slow down the VOUT rise like a soft-start behavior. 
7, 8 
IN 
Input Supply Voltage Pin. It is recommended to use a 4.7μF or larger ceramic capacitor from IN 
pin to ground to get good power supply decoupling. This ceramic capacitor should be placed as 
close as possible to IN pin. 
Exposed 
Pad 
‒ 
Exposed Pad. Connect it to a large ground plane to maximize thermal performance. This pad is 
not an electrical connection point.

High PSRR, Low Dropout Linear Regulator

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
The SGM2048 is a low noise, high PSRR and fast 
transient response LDO and provides 1A output current. 
These features make the device a reliable solution to 
solve many challenging problems in the generation of 
clean 
and 
accurate 
power 
supply. 
The 
high 
performance also makes the SGM2048 useful in a 
variety of applications. The SGM2048 provides the 
protection 
function 
for 
output 
overload, 
output 
short-circuit condition and overheating. 
The SGM2048 provides an EN pin as an external chip 
enable control to enable/disable the device. When the 
regulator is in shutdown state, the shutdown current 
consumes as low as 1μA (TYP). 
 
Input Capacitor Selection (CIN) 
The input decoupling capacitor should be placed as 
close as possible to the IN pin to ensure the device 
stability. 10μF or larger X7R or X5R ceramic capacitor 
is selected to get good dynamic performance. 
When VIN is required to provide large current 
instantaneously, a large effective input capacitor is 
required. Multiple input capacitors can limit the input 
tracking inductance. Adding more input capacitors is 
available to restrict the ringing and keep it below the 
device absolute maximum ratings. 
 
Output Capacitor Selection (COUT) 
The output capacitor should be placed as close as 
possible to the OUT pin. 10μF or larger X7R or X5R 
ceramic capacitor is selected to get good dynamic 
performance. The minimum effective capacitance of 
COUT that SGM2048 can remain stable is 4.7μF. For 
ceramic capacitor, temperature, DC bias and package 
size will change the effective capacitance, so enough 
margin of COUT must be considered in design. 
Additionally, COUT with larger capacitance and lower 
ESR will help increase the high frequency PSRR and 
improve the load transient response. 
 
Noise-Reduction Capacitor (CNR) 
A 10nF CNR is used to minimize the noise of LDO in 
application. VREF, output resistor divider and error 
amplifier are the dominant noise source of LDO in 
application, but for the SGM2048, the VREF does not 
contribute significantly to noise due to noise-reduction 
capacitor CNR. On the contrary, the dominant noise 
sources are the output resistor divider and the error 
amplifier. 
Dropout Voltage and VIN 
The SGM2048 features low dropout voltage due to low 
RDS(ON) PMOSFET power transistor. For Linear 
regulator, when (VIN - VOUT) < dropout voltage (VDROP), 
the PMOSFET power transistor will be turned on like a 
switch, the parameter of linear regulator, such as 
PSRR, load and input transient responses, will be 
degraded so much. To get good performance in 
application, the VIN must be larger than (VOUT + VDROP). 
 
Adjustable Regulator 
The output voltage of the SGM2048-ADJ can be 
adjusted from 0.8V to 6V. The FB pin will be connected 
to two external resistors as shown in Figure 4. The 
output voltage is determined by the following equation:

Figure 4. Adjustable Output Voltage Application 
R1 and R2 can be calculated for any output voltage 
range using Equation 1. Choose R2 = 10kΩ to maintain 
an 80μA minimum load. 
 
Enable Control 
The EN pin of the SGM2048 is used to enable/disable 
the device and to deactivate/activate the output 
automatic discharge function. 
When the EN pin voltage is lower than VEN(L), the device 
is in shutdown state. There is no current flowing from IN 
to OUT pins. In this state, the automatic discharge 
transistor is active to discharge the output voltage 
through a 105Ω (TYP) resistor. 
When the EN pin voltage is higher than VEN(H), the 
device is in active state. The output voltage is regulated 
to the expected value and the automatic discharge 
transistor is turned off.

APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued) 
Start-Up 
In Figure 2 and Figure 3, a low-pass (RC) filter is used 
to reduce the noise of bandgap voltage reference, the 
external CNR and the resistance controlled by the 
quick-start circuit consists of this filter. The switch for 
quick-start is closed at start-up, CNR will be charged by 
VREF circuit and there is only 33kΩ resistance between 
bandgap circuit output and the NR pin. It is about 2ms 
after the device is enabled that the switch for quick-start 
will be turned off, the resistance between the NR pin 
and bandgap circuit output will be changed to about 
265kΩ. This low-pass filter helps LDO achieve very 
good noise-reduction after start-up due to resistance is 
changed from 33kΩ to 265kΩ. Generally, low leakage 
ceramic capacitor is used and the value of CNR is larger 
than 10nF. Larger CNR is better to reduce the noise of 
LDO, but it prolongs the start-up time of LDO, the value 
of CNR must be the trade-off between noise and start-up 
time. 
Under-Voltage Lockout (UVLO) 
The UVLO circuit monitors the input voltage to prevent 
the device from turning on before VIN rises above the 
VUVLO threshold. The UVLO circuit responds quickly to 
glitches on the IN pin and attempts to disable the output 
of the device if any of these rails collapses. The local 
input capacitance prevents severe brownouts in most 
applications. 
Minimum Load 
The SGM2048 fixed voltage versions can remain stable 
when there is no output load. 
Input Power Supply 
The input power supply range is from 2.2V to 7V. VIN 
must be larger than (VOUT + VDROP) in application. The 
input ceramic capacitor must be placed as close as 
possible to the IN pin, this CIN can help improve the 
output noise performance of LDO. 
Reverse Current Protection 
The pass transistor has an inherent body diode which 
will be forward biased in the case when VOUT > (VIN + 
0.3V). If extended reverse voltage operation is 
anticipated, external limiting might be appropriate. 
Negatively Biased Output 
When the output voltage is negative, the chip may not 
start up due to parasitic effects. Ensure that the output 
is greater than -0.3V under all conditions. If negatively 
biased output is excessive and expected in the 
application, a Schottky diode can be added between 
the OUT pin and GND pin. 
Output Current Limit and Short-Circuit 
Protection 
When overload events happen, the output current is 
internally limited to 1.6A (TYP). When the OUT pin is 
shorted to ground, the short-circuit protection will limit 
the output current to 1.6A (TYP). 
Thermal Shutdown 
The SGM2048 can detect the temperature of die. When 
the die temperature exceeds the threshold value of 
thermal shutdown, the SGM2048 will be in shutdown 
state and remain in this state until the die temperature 
decreases to +150℃. 
Power Dissipation (PD) 
Thermal protection limits power dissipation in the 
SGM2048. When power dissipation on pass element 
(PD = (VIN - VOUT) × IOUT) is too much and the operating 
junction temperature exceeds +170℃, the OTP circuit 
starts the thermal shutdown function and turns the pass 
element off. 
Therefore, thermal analysis for the chosen application is 
important to guarantee reliable performance over all 
conditions. To guarantee reliable operation, the junction 
temperature of the SGM2048 must not exceed +125℃. 
The maximum allowable power dissipation depends on 
the thermal resistance of the IC package, the PCB 
layout, the rate of surrounding airflow, and the 
difference between the junction temperature and 
ambient temperature. The maximum power dissipation 
can be approximated using the following equation: 
PD(MAX) = (TJ(MAX) - TA)/θJA          (2) 
where TJ(MAX) is the maximum junction temperature, TA 
is 
the 
ambient 
temperature, 
and 
θJA 
is 
the 
junction-to-ambient thermal resistance. 
 
Layout Guidelines 
To get good PSRR, low output noise and high transient 
response performance, the input and output bypass 
capacitors must be placed as close as possible to the 
IN pin and OUT pin separately. VIN and VOUT had better 
use separate ground planes and these ground planes 
are single point connected to the GND pin.
