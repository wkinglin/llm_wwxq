GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM3140B is a current-regulated buck/boost 
charge pump LED driver capable of driving 500mA 
output current. It is ideal for powering high brightness 
LEDs for camera flash applications. The SGM3140B 
has 1×/2× operation mode to control the output current 
for flash and torch modes. Both flash and torch modes 
can be used continuously until thermal shutdown occurs. 
The supply voltage operates from 2.7V to 5.5V and is 
well suited for various applications powered by a 1-cell 
Li-Ion battery, as well as 3-cell or 4-cell NiCd, NiMH or 
Alkaline batteries. The SGM3140B automatically converts 
between boost and buck modes. Therefore, it ensures 
that LED current cannot be restricted by the forward 
voltage. High switching frequency makes it easy to use 
tiny components. Small 0603 current sense resistors 
can be used due to the low FB reference voltage. 
The SGM3140B provides very low shutdown current 
and soft-start function. Built-in soft-start circuitry avoids 
excessive 
inrush 
current 
during 
startup. 
The 
SGM3140B also includes a comprehensive set of 
protection features such as over-voltage protection, 
over-current protection and thermal shutdown. 
The SGM3140B is available in a Green TDFN-3×3-10L 
package and is specified over an ambient temperature 
range of -40℃ to +85℃.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.

PIN DESCRIPTION 
PIN 
NAME 
FUNCTION 
1 
VIN 
Charge Pump Input Voltage. Decouple with a 4.7μF or 10μF ceramic capacitor close to the device. 
2 
C1 
Positive Terminal of the Flying Capacitor. Connect a 1μF ceramic capacitor close to the device. 
3 
C2 
Negative Terminal of the Flying Capacitor. Connect a 1μF ceramic capacitor close to the device. 
4 
FLASH 
Logic Input to Toggle Operation between Flash and Torch Modes. In torch mode, FB is regulated to the 
internal 47mV reference. In flash mode, FB reference voltage (VFB) can be set by RSET resistor. Choose 
the external current sense resistor (RSENSE) according to desired current in either torch mode or flash 
mode. 
5 
EN 
Shutdown Control Input. Pull it high to VIN for normal operation. Pull it Low to ground for shutdown. In 
normal operation, it is recommended to connect to VIN only after VIN has settled when the VIN ramping 
up is slow. 
6 
RSET 
RSET Pin. Connect a resistor from this pin to ground. When in Flash mode (FLASH = High), this resistor 
sets the FB regulation voltage by the following equation: 
VFB = (1.26V/RSET) × 10.2kΩ. 
7 
FB 
Feedback Input for Current. Connect the current sense resistor from FB to GND. 
8 
SGND 
Internal Ground Pin. Control circuitry returns current to this pin. 
9 
PGND 
Power Ground Pin. Flying capacitor current returns through this pin. 
10 
VOUT 
Charge Pump Output Voltage. Decouple with at least 1μF external capacitor. If a larger capacitor is used, 
the output ripple is smaller. 
Exposed 
Pad 
GND 
Exposed Pad. It should be soldered to PCB board and connected to GND.
