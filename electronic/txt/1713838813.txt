APRIL 2024 – REV. A. 1 
GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM42553 is a triple half-bridge driver, and each 
channel is controlled by separate controllable input. 
This device is designed to drive a three-phase 
brushless DC motor, as well as solenoids or other loads. 
The output driver block for each consists of 
N-MOSFETs configured as half-bridge to drive the 
motor. This device integrates three dedicated ground 
terminals (PGNDx) for each channel to sense the 
external current independently. 
The SGM42553 integrates a comparator, which can be 
used if current limit function is needed in the motor 
system. 
A number of protection features are provided in the 
device including under-voltage lockout, short-circuit, 
over-current and over-temperature shutdown. The 
nFAULT pin is used to indicate the fault problems. 
The SGM42553 is available in Green TQFN-6×6-36AL 
and TSSOP-28 (Exposed Pad) packages. 
FEATURES 
● Motor Supply Voltage Range: 8V to 45V 
● Three Half-Bridges 
● High Output Current Capability: 3A Peak 
● Low On-Resistance 
● Individual Controllable Input  
● Built-in Comparator 
● Built-in LDO Regulator: 3.3V/10mA 
● Low Power Sleep Mode 
● Available in Green TQFN-6×6-36AL and 
TSSOP-28 (Exposed Pad) Packages

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
Overview 
The SGM42553 provides three 3A half-bridge drivers, 
each channel is controlled by separate controllable 
input. It is suitable for driving brushless DC motors, 
brushed DC motors, and solenoid loads. The device is 
allowed to operate from a wide power supply of 8V to 
45V.

Charge Pump 
A charge pump is used to generate the gate drive for 
the high-side FETs. Two external capacitors are 
needed for the charge pump, one between VM and 
VCP pins and one between CPL and CPH pins. As the 
nSLEEP is pulled low, the charge pump will be turned 
off. See the following figure for details.

Comparator 
The SGM42553 integrates a comparator inside the 
device, which is commonly used as current limit 
detection. Please refer to the diagram below in Figure 6, 
which is the typical application circuit for current limit 
function.

Protection Circuits 
The SGM42553 integrated internal circuit protections 
include thermal shutdown, under-voltage lockout 
(UVLO), and over-current protection. 
 
Under-Voltage Lockout (UVLO) 
If the voltages on VM pin fall below their under-voltage 
lockout thresholds, the device will be disabled, charge 
pump will be turned off, and internal logic will be reset. 
Device resumes operation when all of them go back 
above their UVLO thresholds. When under-voltage 
locking occurs, the nFAULT is pulled down, after the 
device returns to work, the nFAULT is released. 
 
Thermal Shutdown (TSD) 
All bridges and drivers are shutdown if a junction 
over-temperature occurs in the device and the nFAULT 
pin will be driven low. Once the temperature goes back 
to the safe level, device resumes its operation. 
 
Over-Current Protection (OCP) 
Each MOSFET is protected by its own over-current 
protection circuit. In case of an over-current (any 
direction), only the specific half-bridge may be turned 
off, the nFAULT pin will be driven low. An over-current 
will occur due to a short between a switching node and 
ground or to the VM supply line, or to the other node of 
the bridge (a winding short).

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Output Stage 
If current sensing is needed in the motor control system, 
it is needed to connect the sense resistor from PGNDx 
to GND. When choosing the sense resistor, make sure 
that the PGNDx voltage is below ±500mV, and the 
package of the sense resistor can stand the power 
dissipation (I2 × R). Low inductance resistor is 
recommended, and the resistor should be placed close 
to the PGNDx pin on the PCB layout. 
 
Functional Modes 
To idle the device and put it in the low power sleep 
mode, the nSLEEP pin can be pulled low. In the sleep 
mode, all half-bridges are disabled, internal clocks are 
paused, and the charge pumps for the gate drivers are 
stopped. All logic inputs are ignored in sleep mode. 
nRESET and nSLEEP Operation 
When the nRESET pin is pulled low, the half-bridges 
are all disabled. The nRESET is an active-low reset 
input for the internal logic. All other logic inputs are 
ignored if nRESET is low. 
The nSLEEP is an active-low input to put the device in 
low power (sleep mode) state. In sleep mode, all 
internal clocks, bridges, charge pump are disabled. All 
logic inputs are ignored. V3P3 regulator stays on when 
device is in sleep mode. When waking up from sleep 
mode, time delay (about 1ms) is needed before outputs 
operate.
