dropout voltage linear regulator. It is capable of 
supplying 450mA output current with typical dropout 
voltage of only 70mV. The operating input voltage 
range is from 1.9V to 5.5V. The fixed output voltages 
are 1.8V, 2.5V, 2.8V, 3.0V, 3.3V and 5.0V.

short-circuit current limit and thermal shutdown 
protection. The SGM2061 has automatic discharge 
function to quickly discharge VOUT in the disabled status. 
The SGM2061is suitable for applications which need 
low noise and fast transient response power supply, 
such as power supply of camera module in smart 
phone, etc. 
The SGM2061 is available in an ultra-thin Green 
WLCSP-0.64×0.64-4B-A package. It operates over an 
operating temperature range of -40℃ to +125℃.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
The SGM2061 is an ultra-low noise and low dropout 
LDO and provides 450mA output current. These 
features make the device a reliable solution to solve 
many challenging problems in the generation of clean 
and accurate power supply. The high performance also 
makes the SGM2061 useful in a variety of applications. 
The SGM2061 provides the protection function for 
output overload, output short-circuit condition and 
overheating. 
The SGM2061 provides an EN pin as an external chip 
enable control to enable/disable the device. When the 
regulator is in shutdown state, the shutdown current 
consumes as low as 0.03μA (TYP). 
 
Input Capacitor Selection (CIN) 
The input decoupling capacitor should be placed as 
close as possible to the IN pin for ensuring the device 
stability. 1μF or larger X7R or X5R ceramic capacitor is 
selected to get good dynamic performance. 
When VIN is required to provide large current 
instantaneously, a large effective input capacitor is 
required. Multiple input capacitors can limit the input 
tracking inductance. Adding more input capacitors is 
available to restrict the ringing and to keep it below the 
device absolute maximum ratings. 
 
Output Capacitor Selection (COUT) 
The output decoupling capacitor should be placed as 
close as possible to the OUT pin. 1μF or larger X7R or 
X5R ceramic capacitor is selected to get good dynamic 
performance. The minimum effective capacitance of 
COUT that SGM2061 can remain stable is 0.5μF. For 
ceramic capacitor, temperature, DC bias and package 
size will change the effective capacitance, so enough 
margin of COUT must be considered in design. 
Additionally, COUT with larger capacitance and lower 
ESR will help increase the high frequency PSRR and 
improve the load transient response. 
 
Enable Control 
The EN pin of the SGM2061 is used to enable/disable 
its device and to deactivate/activate the output 
automatic discharge function. 
When the EN pin voltage is lower than 0.6V, the device 
is in shutdown state, there is no current flowing from IN 
to OUT pins. In this state, the automatic discharge 
transistor is active to discharge the output voltage 
through a 270Ω (TYP) resistor. 
When the EN pin voltage is higher than 1V, the device 
is in active state, the input voltage is regulated to the 
output voltage and the automatic discharge transistor is 
turned off. 
The EN pin is pulled down by internal 0.03μA (TYP) 
current source when the EN pin is floated. This current 
source will ensure the SGM2061 in shutdown state and 
reduce the power dissipation in system. 
 
Reverse Current 
The pass transistor has an inherent body diode which 
will be forward biased in the case when VOUT > (VIN + 
0.3V). If extended reverse voltage operation is 
anticipated, external limiting might be appropriate. 
 
Negatively Biased Output 
When the output is negative voltage, the chip may not 
start up due to parasitic effects. Ensure that the output 
is greater than -0.3V under all conditions. If excessive 
negatively biased output is expected in the application, 
a Schottky diode can be added between the OUT pin 
and GND pin. 
 
Output Current Limit and Short-Circuit 
Protection 
When overload events happen, the output current is 
internally limited to 900mA (TYP). When the OUT pin is 
shorted to ground, the short-circuit protection will limit 
the output current to 500mA (TYP). 
 
Thermal Shutdown 
The SGM2061 can detect the temperature of die. When 
the die temperature exceeds the threshold value of 
thermal shutdown, the SGM2061 will be in shutdown 
state and it will remain in this state until the die 
temperature decreases to +140℃.

APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued) 
Power Dissipation (PD) 
Thermal protection limits power dissipation in the 
SGM2061. When power dissipation on pass element 
(PD = (VIN - VOUT) × IOUT) is too much and the operating 
junction temperature exceeds +160℃, the OTP circuit 
starts the thermal shutdown function and turns the pass 
element off. 
Therefore, thermal analysis for the chosen application is 
important to guarantee reliable performance over all 
conditions. To guarantee reliable operation, the junction 
temperature of the SGM2061 must not exceed +125℃. 
The maximum allowable power dissipation depends on 
the thermal resistance of the IC package, the PCB 
layout, the rate of surrounding airflow, and the 
difference between the junction temperature and 
ambient temperature. The maximum power dissipation 
can be approximated using the following equation: 
PD(MAX) = (TJ(MAX) - TA) / θJA             (1) 
where TJ(MAX) is the maximum junction temperature, TA 
is the ambient temperature, and θJA is the junction 
-to-ambient thermal resistance.
