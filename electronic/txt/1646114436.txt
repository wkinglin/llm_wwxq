FEBRUARY2022–REV.A 
GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM2596 and SGM2596D are 16mΩ (TYP) 
on-resistance, integrated two N-MOSFETs, dual-channel 
load switches. The devices can operate over a wide 
input voltage range of 0.6V to 5.7V. Each channel can 
support a 6A maximum continuous load current and is 
independently controlled by the ONx pin (ON1 or ON2). 
The VOUTx rise time can be programmed by setting an 
additional capacitor to the CTx pin. 
The devices have thermal shutdown function. When the 
junction temperature exceeds +160 ℃, the inner 
N-MOSFET will be turned off through the thermal 
shutdown circuitry, and will remain off until the die 
temperature drops below +140℃. The SGM2596D also 
has quick output discharge function when the switch is 
disabled. 
The SGM2596 and SGM2596D are both available in a 
Green TDFN-3×2-14AL package. They are rated over 
the -40℃ to +105℃ temperature range.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
Overview 
The SGM2596 and SGM2596D are 5.7V, 16mΩ (TYP) 
on-resistance, integrated two N-MOSFETs, dual-channel 
load switches. Each channel can support a 6A maximum 
continuous load current and be enabled independently 
by the ONx pin. The devices have independent control 
pin to set the slew rate (or the soft-start time) of VOUTx 
for each channel, which can control the inrush current 
and reduce the voltage drop. The devices also have the 
thermal shutdown function. Only SGM2596D includes 
internal integrated quick output discharge (QOD) to 
remove the remaining charge from the output when the 
switch is disabled. 
SGM2596 and SGM2596D are highly integrated. Using 
SGM2596 or SGM2596D can reduce the PCB area and 
the BOM count greatly, even the cost. 
 
VBIAS Power Supply 
VBIAS is the power supply to the inner circuit including 
control logic, quick output discharge and charge pump. 
The support voltage range is from 2.5V to 5.7V. For 
most applications, a 0.1µF capacitor is sufficient. It is 
recommended to use X5R or X7R dielectrics ceramic 
capacitor. 
 
Input Capacitor 
Turning on the N-MOSFET to charge load capacitor will 
generate inrush current, which may cause the VIN drop. 
In order to prevent the drop, a capacitor must be placed 
between the VINx and GND pins. Usually, a 1μF input 
capacitor (CIN) placed close to the pins is sufficient. 
However, higher capacitance values could further 
reduce the voltage drop. So, larger CIN can be used to 
reduce the voltage drop in high current applications.  
 
Output Capacitor 
A 0.1μF output capacitor (COUT) should be placed 
between the VOUTx and GND pins. This capacitor can 
prevent parasitic board inductance from forcing VOUTx 
below GND when the switch is turned on. It is 
recommended that CIN is greater than COUT. 
Control Pin 
There is an independent control pin ONx to turn on or 
turn off the corresponding N-MOSFET for each channel. 
When the ONx pin is driven high, the switch will be 
turned on, and when the ONx pin is driven low, the 
switch will be turned off. The ONx pin is compatible with 
standard GPIO logic level threshold, such as 1.2V, 
1.8V, 2.5V or 3.3V. 
The recommended start-up sequence is: VBIAS power 
on first, then VINx power on, and finally to enable the 
ONx. Or VINx and VBIAS power on simultaneously, then 
the ONx is enabled.  
The ONx pin cannot be left floating and must be 
connected to either high or low level as requirement. 
 
Soft-Start Control 
A capacitor between CTX and GND pins determines the 
slew rate of VOUT for each channel. The slew rate can 
be calculated using the below equation. 
SR = 0.55 × CT                 (1) 
So, the soft-start time of VOUT is:  
tSS = SR × VOUT = 0.55 × CT × VOUT        (2) 
where: 
SR is the slew rate (in µs/V). 
CT is the capacitance value on the CTx pin (in pF). 
tSS is the soft-start time of VOUT. 
For the desired rise time performance, the capacitor 
voltage rating used on this pin must be 10V or above. 
When CT < 100pF, the equation cannot be applied. The 
recommended value of CT is bigger than 100pF. If CT = 
0pF or left floating, use Table 4 to determine rise times. 
The soft-start time is valid only when the ONx pin is 
enabled after VINx and VBIAS are ready.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Quick Output Discharge (QOD) 
The QOD feature is only available for SGM2596D. 
Each channel has a resistor which is not activated to 
discharge by default. When the ONx pin is pulled low or 
VBIAS is lower than 2.2V (TYP) or over-temperature 
happens, the resistor will be connected between the 
VOUTx and GND to discharge the output quickly. This 
resistor pulls down the output and prevents it from 
floating when the switch is turned off. 
 
Thermal Shutdown 
Thermal shutdown protects the device from excessive 
temperature and can recovery automatically. When die 
temperature exceeds +160℃ (TYP), both MOSFETs 
will be shut down and remained off until die 
temperature drops below +140℃ (TYP).

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
Power Sequencing 
In some systems, especially including processors or 
subsystems, the power sequence must be followed. 
The device provides a simple solution to meet the 
power sequencing. As shown in Figure 4, VOUT2 is 
powered on after VOUT1.

Saving Standby Power 
In battery-powered equipment, the strict power budget 
must be met under different operating modes. In 
standby or sleep mode, leakage current of some 
modules such as LCD displays, Wi-Fi, power amplifiers 
and GPS may be up to several mA or more. The large 
consumption is far from meeting the application 
requirements. Using load switches ahead of these 
modules can reduce this leakage current to µA level, 
which can save the standby power consumption greatly. 
The configuration is illustrated in Figure 5.

Reverse Current Protection 
The device can be combined into a single-channel load 
switch with reverse current blocking. The configuration 
is illustrated in Figure 7. VIN1 is the input and VIN2 is the 
output or vice verse. When ON1 and ON2 are high, the 
both internal N-MOSFETs are turned on. When ON1 
and ON2 are low, the both internal N-MOSFETs are 
turned off, and the body diode blocks the reverse 
current.

Detailed Design Procedure 
Inrush Current 
When the switch is enabled, VOUTx begins to soft-start 
from 0V linearly. Inrush current can be calculated by 
the following formula. 
IINRUSH = CL × dVOUT/dt           (3) 
 
Soft-Start Time 
From the Equation 3, we can also calculate the 
soft-start time. 
tSS = CL × VOUT/IINRUSH           (4) 
In this example: CL = 22μF, VOUTx = VINx = 3.3V, IINRUSH = 
500mA. 
So, 
tSS = 22μF × 3.3V/500mA ≈ 145.2μs     (5) 
To ensure an inrush current is less than 500mA, the 
soft-start time cannot be less than 145.2μs. The next, 
we only need to choose a CT value to meet the desired 
soft-start time.  
 
CT Selection 
From equation, 
tSS = 0.55 × CT × VOUT           (6) 
We can calculate the CT ≈ 80pF. 
From the section of soft-start control, we know that 
when CT < 100pF, the equation cannot be applied and 
the calculated value is not accurate. So we need to 
choose more than 100pF capacitor which value is close 
and universal. Finally, CT = 220pF is chosen. 
We can also refer the following Table 4 to choose CT. 
The tR (the rise time from 10% to 90% of VOUTx) at 
different CT have been measured under CL = 0.1µF, CIN 
= 1µF and RL = 10Ω. 
If tSS is known, we can also know tR = 0.8 × tSS ≈ 
116.2μs. 
According to the tR, look up Table 4 to get the 
recommended value CT which sets the rise time not be 
less than the calculated. 
When CT is left floating, the rise times can be obtained 
from CT = 0pF listed in Table 4.

Layout Guidelines 
For the best operation of device, the following 
guidelines must be strictly followed: 
 
All high-current traces (VINx and VOUTx) could be 
as short and wide as possible. It is recommended 
to use ground copper pour. Special attention 
should be paid to that size and number of via must 
be enough for a given current. 
 
The input and output capacitors should be placed 
as close as possible to the device. 
 
Decoupling capacitors of VBIAS should be placed 
next to the VBIAS pin. 
 
Place the CT capacitor close to the CTx pin. 
 
Use sufficient thermal vias to directly connect the 
exposed thermal pad to the ground plane on the 
bottom layer under the body of IC, which can 
relieve the thermal further and achieve better 
thermal performance.

Thermal Considerations 
Assuming a given ambient temperature and package 
thermal resistance, the maximum allowable power 
dissipation is calculated by: 
−
=
J(MAX)
A
D(MAX)
JA
T
T
P
θ
 
where: 
 
PD(MAX) is the maximum power dissipation. 
 
TJ(MAX) is the maximum operating junction temperature. 
 
TA is the operating ambient temperature. 
 
θJA is the package thermal resistance.  
The maximum operating junction temperature must be 
restricted to +125℃ under normal operating conditions. 
Care should be taken that the thermal vias are placed 
under the exposed pad of the device, thus allowing for 
thermal dissipation away from the device.
