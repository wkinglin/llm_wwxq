GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM41543/SGM41543D are battery chargers and 
system power path management devices with integrated 
converter and power switches for using with single-cell Li-Ion 
or Li-polymer batteries. This highly integrated 3.78A device is 
capable of fast charging and supports a wide input voltage 
range suitable for smart phones, tablets and portable systems. 
I2C programming makes it a very flexible powering and 
charger design solution. 
The devices include four main power switches: input reverse 
blocking FET (RBFET, Q1), high-side switching FET for Buck 
or Boost mode (HSFET, Q2), low-side switching FET for Buck 
or Boost mode (LSFET, Q3) and battery FET that controls the 
interconnection of the system and battery (BATFET, Q4). The 
bootstrap diode for the high-side gate driving is also 
integrated. The internal power path has a very low impedance 
that reduces the charging time and maximizes the battery 
discharge efficiency. Moreover, the input voltage and current 
regulations provide maximum charging power delivery to the 
battery with various types of input sources. 
A wide range of input sources are supported, including 
standard USB hosts, charging ports and USB compliant high 
voltage adaptors. The default input current limit is 
automatically selected based on the built-in USB interface. 
This limit is determined by the detection circuit in the system 
(e.g. USB PHY). SGM41543/SGM41543D are USB 2.0 and 
USB 3.0 power specifications compliant with input current 
and voltage regulation. It also meets USB On-The-Go (OTG) 
power rating specification and is capable of boosting the 
battery voltage to supply 5.15V on VBUS with 2A (or 1.2A) 
current limit. 
The system voltage is regulated slightly above the battery 
voltage by the power path management circuit and is kept 
above the programmable minimum system voltage (3.5V by 
default). Therefore, system power is maintained even if the 
battery is completely depleted or removed. Dynamic power 
management 
(DPM) 
feature 
is 
also 
included 
that 
automatically reduces the charge current if the input current 
or voltage limit is reached. If the system load continues to 
increase after reduction of charge current down to zero, the 
power path management provides the deficit from battery by 
discharging battery to the system until the system power 
demand is fulfilled. This is called supplement mode, which 
prevents the input source from overloading. 
Starting and termination of a charging cycle can be 
accomplished without software control. The sensed battery 
voltage is used to decide for starting phase of charging in one 
of the three phases of charging cycle: pre-conditioning, 
constant current or constant voltage. When the charge 
current falls below a preset limit and the battery voltage is 
above recharge threshold, the charger function will 
automatically terminate and end the charging cycle. If the 
voltage of a charged battery falls below the recharge 
threshold, the charger begins another charging cycle. 
Several safety features are provided in the SGM41543/ 
SGM41543D 
such 
as 
over-voltage 
and 
over-current 
protections, battery temperature monitoring, charging safety 
timing, thermal shutdown and input UVLO. TS pin is 
connected to an NTC thermistor for battery temperature 
monitoring and protection in both charge and Boost modes 
according to JEITA profile. This device also features thermal 
regulation in which the charge current is reduced, if the 
junction temperature exceeds 80℃ or 120℃ (selectable).  
Charging status is reported by the STAT output and 
fault/status bits. A negative pulse is sent to the nINT output 
pin as soon as a fault occurs to notify the host. BATFET reset 
control is provided by nQON pin to exit ship mode or for a full 
system reset. 
The devices supply a DCEN signal to control an external 
P-MOSFET or load switch as a direct charging path for low 
voltage PMID, or to control a 2:1 switching capacitor divider 
for high voltage PMID. 
The SGM41543/SGM41543D are available in a Green 
TQFN-4×4-24L package.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

TS 
AI 
Temperature Sense Input Pin. Connect to the battery NTC thermistor that is grounded on 
the other side. To program operating temperature window, it can be biased by a resistor 
divider between REGN and GND. Charge suspends if TS voltage goes out of the 
programmed range. It is recommended to use a 103AT-2 type thermistor. 
If NTC or TS pin function is not needed, use a 10kΩ/10kΩ pair for the resistor divider.

nQON 
DI 
BATFET On/Off Control Input. Use an internal pull-up to a small voltage for maintaining the 
default high logic (whenever a source or battery is available). In the ship mode, the 
BATFET is off. To exit ship mode and turn BATFET on, a logic low pulse with a duration of 
tSHIPMODE (1s TYP) can be applied to nQON. When VBUS source is not connected, a logic 
low pulse with a duration of tQON_RST (10s TYP) resets the system power (SYS) by turning 
BATFET off for tBATFET_RST (320ms TYP) and then goes back to provide a full power reset for 
system.

capacitor between REGN pin and GND. It is recommended to place the capacitor close to 
the REGN pin. 
23

PMID 
P 
PMID Pin. PMID is the actual higher voltage port of converter (Buck or Boost) and is 
connected to the drain of the reverse blocking MOSFET (RBFET) and the drain of HSFET. 
Connect a 22μF ceramic capacitor from PMID pin to GND. It is the proper point for 
decoupling of high frequency switching currents.

VBUS 
P 
Charger Input (VIN). The internal N-channel reverse blocking MOSFET (RBFET) is 
connected between VBUS and PMID pins. Place a 1μF ceramic capacitor from VBUS pin 
to GND close to the device. For SGM41543, this pin senses the input voltage.

Exposed 
Pad

P 
Thermal Pad and Ground Reference. It is the ground reference for the device and also the 
thermal pad to conduct heat from the device (not suitable for high current return). Tie it 
externally to the PCB ground plane (GND). Thermal vias under the pad are needed to 
conduct the heat to the PCB ground planes.
