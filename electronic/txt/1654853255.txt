GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM61230 is a synchronous Buck converter with a 
wide input voltage range of 4.5V to 28V. This device 
can deliver up to 3A to the output over a wide input 
voltage. It is an easy-to-use device with power switches 
and peak current mode control compensation all 
integrated in a small 6-pin package. A typical 5ms 
soft-start ramp is also included to minimize the inrush 
current. 
This device employs cycle-by-cycle peak current limit, 
output over-voltage protection and thermal shutdown 
with auto recovery. The current limit is implemented for 
both switches and has foldback feature to prevent 
overheating (and thermal shutdown) when an output 
short is detected. Auto recovery after over-current, 
output short, overheating or over-voltage fault maintains 
the system operational with no shutdown. 
This converter has a fixed 410kHz switching frequency 
that minimizes the EMI noise problems. However the 
actual frequency drops during PSM (pulse skip mode) 
to maximize efficiency at light load. It also drops in 
some fault conditions. 
The SGM61230 is available in a Green TSOT-23-6 
package.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged by ESD if you don’t 
pay attention to ESD protection. SGMICRO recommends that 
all integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because very small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet its published specifications.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
Overview 
The SGM61230 is a 28V/3A synchronous Buck 
converter with over-current, short-circuit and thermal 
shutdown with auto recovery. Figure 2 shows the 
simplified block diagram of the SGM61230. The two 
integrated MOSFET switches of the power stage 
(66mΩ high-side and 36mΩ low-side) can provide up to 
3A of continuous current with high efficiency. 
The device is powered up when VIN exceeds the UVLO 
threshold (4.1V TYP). At no load and with no switching, 
the typical operating current is 25μA and when the 
device is disabled by EN pin, it is only 2µA (TYP). The 
internal loop compensation minimizes the BOM cost and 
simplifies the design. The inrush current is also limited 
by an internal 5ms soft-start ramp. 
Operating Principle 
Peak current mode (PCM) control is used in the 
SGM61230 to regulate the output voltage. VOUT is 
sensed by the external resistor divider on the FB pin 
and compared to the internal 0.603V reference voltage 
by a trans-conductance error amplifier. The error 
amplifier (EA) output (current) is fed to the internal 
compensation components between the EA output and 
GND to generate a voltage that is used as the peak 
current reference for comparing with the sensed 
high-side switch current. The output of this comparator 
(COMP) can reset the flipflop that controls the switches. 
This flipflop receives fixed frequency clock pulses from 
the internal 410kHz oscillator. In the normal operation 
the high-side switch is turned on in the beginning of 
each switching cycle. The current in the high-side 
switch starts to rise until the peak current reference is 
reached that resets the flipflop. This will turn off the 
high-side switch and turn on the low-side switch. The 
low-side switch stays on until the end of the cycle. 
Slope Compensation 
Peak current mode-controlled devices in general are 
subject to sub-harmonic oscillation instability at higher 
duty cycles (typically > 50%). To avoid this instability a 
compensating ramp signal is used. The ramp starts 
from zero in the beginning of each cycle with a specific 
slop and is added to the sensed high-side switch 
current before it is compared to the peak current 
reference. 
Anti-High-Overload Mode 
The SGM61230 supports overload mode. When the 
output current continues overload while the system 
power up or in turbo mode, the SGM61230 exports the 
maximize power and limit the maximum peak current in 
high-side and valley current in low-side, the device 
keeps in cycle-by-cycle limit to obtain the system’s 
power request. The SGM61230 does not shut down 
until the device heats and then goes to thermal 
shutdown. The load increase, the output voltage goes 
low, if the output voltage drops to 20%, the device will 
go into short protection. It reduces current limit 
threshold and the switching frequency goes down due 
to reduce power dissipation and device goes into 
thermal shutdown. When the output current is low 
enough, the device goes into PFM mode. 
Pulse Skip Mode (PSM) and PWM Mode 
In light load, OVP does not occur and the device can 
operate in the normal PWM mode, but to improve light 
load efficiency, the device is designed to skip some 
pulses by entering to the PSM mode. When the peak 
current is lower than 500mA typically, the device enters 
PSM. In PSM, when the output voltage is detected to 
be above the internal voltage reference level of the 
error amplifier, the high-side MOSFET is kept off for a 
few cycles (skipping clock pulses) by clamping current 
reference until the output voltages are discharged 
below the internal voltage reference level. Note that the 
integrated current comparator operates based on the 
peak inductor current and the average load current may 
vary depending on the output filters and load type. 
Enable Pin and UVLO Adjustment 
The EN pin can be used to turn the device on and off or 
to change the UVLO thresholds. The device is enabled 
when the EN pin voltage exceeds its high threshold. A 
low EN voltage disables the device brings it to the 
low-quiescent (IQ) state. 
The EN pin is internally pulled up by a small current 
source (IP) so the device is enabled if EN pin is floated. 
An open drain or open collector output can be used to 
control the EN pin. 
VIN is monitored by the internal under-voltage lockout 
circuit and if it is below UVLO threshold, the device is 
disabled. The internal UVLO has a 400mV hysteresis. If 
higher thresholds are needed, EN pin can be used as 
shown in Figure 3. 
The EN pull-up current is used to set the hysteresis. 
The pull-up current is increased by IIH - IIL when the EN 
pin exceeds its high threshold. Use Equations 1 and 2 
to calculate the R1 and R2 values for the desired UVLO 
low (VUV_L) and high (VUV_H) thresholds.

Output Voltage Programming 
The output voltage is set by a resistor divider between 
VOUT and GND that is tapped to the FB pin. It is 
recommended to use resistors with 1% tolerance or 
better because it directly affects the output accuracy. 
Use Equation 3 and Figure 1 to calculate the output 
voltage. To improve efficiency at light load consider 
larger resistors. Start with 100kΩ for the upper resistor 
(RFB1). Note that if RFB1||RFB2 is too high, the FB pin 
leakage current and other noises can easily affect the 
accuracy and performance of the regulator.

Internal Voltage Reference and Soft-Start 
The SGM61230 device has an internal 0.603V 
reference (VREF) to program the output at the desired 
level. The output voltage is determined by the 
reference voltage seen by the error amplifier. When the 
converter starts (or is enabled), an internal ramp 
voltage begins to rise from near 0V to slightly above 
0.603V with a ramp time of 5ms. The lower of VREF and 
this ramp is used as reference for the error amplifier, 
therefore during startup the ramp provides a soft-start 
for the output. The soft-start is needed to avoid high 
inrush currents caused by rapid increase of output 
voltage across output capacitors and the load. Without 
a soft-start the current limiting protections could trigger 
that interrupts the monotonic rising of the load voltage 
that may result in instability or improper system 
initialization. 
Bootstrap Voltage (BOOT) 
To power the upper switch gate driver, a voltage higher 
than VIN is needed. Bootstrapping technique is used to 
provide this voltage from the switching node by using a 
0.1µF bootstrap capacitor between SW and BOOT pins 
along with an internal bootstrap diode. The voltage is 
internally regulated for driving the high-side switch. An 
X5R or X7R ceramic capacitor is recommended for 
CBOOT to have stable capacitance against temperature 
and voltage variations. To improve drop out, the device 
is designed to operate at 100% duty cycle. 
Output Short-Circuit Protection 
When the output voltage down to 20% of set value, the 
device goes into short-circuit mode, and a foldback 
mode will limit the current output. The high-side peak 
current limit to 2.4A (TYP) and the valley current limit to 
1.4A (TYP), then it avoids the device thermal shutdown 
by the power dissipation. 
A short-circuit is detected when VFB falls below 0.12V 
(TYP). In this condition the current limits of both 
switches are internally reduced to less than half of the 
normal value (foldback). This will reduce the constant 
output current during an output short and prevents 
overheating. During the soft-start period there is no 
foldback and the current limits are normal. 
Output Over-Voltage Protection (OVP) 
An over-voltage protection is included in the device to 
minimize the output voltage overshoots that may occur 
after recovery from an output fault or a large unloading 
transient. The FB pin voltage is compared with the OVP 
thresholds. If the VFB exceeds 108% of the VREF, the 
high-side switch is forced to turn off. When the VFB falls 
below 104%, the high-side switch is allowed to turn on 
again.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Over-Current Protection (OCP) 
The device is protected from over-current conditions by 
cycle-by-cycle current limiting on both high-side and 
low-side MOSFETs. 
High-side MOSFET Over-Current Protection 
The internal peak current mode controller provides an 
inherent current limiting capability for the high-side 
switch on a cycle-by-cycle basis. When high-side 
switch current exceeds peak current limit threshold, 
high-side switch is turned off, until the next cycle. 
Low-side MOSFET Over-Current Protection 
The low-side MOSFET current is also monitored for 
over-current 
protection. 
Normally 
this 
MOSFET 
sources current to the load (source to drain direction) 
while the inductor current is decreasing. At the end of 
each cycle, this current is compared to the preset 
low-side current-limit (ILIM_LS). If the inductor valley 
current exceeds the low-side current limit, the high-side 
MOSFET will not turn on in the next cycle and the 
low-side MOSFET continues to conduct (cycle skipped). 
The high-side switch turns on again when the valley 
current falls below ILIM_LS at the start of another cycle. 
During an over-current fault, the above limits cause 
cycle skipping that slows down the switching frequency 
and reduces the output voltage (due to reduced duty 
cycle). 
Thermal Shutdown 
If the junction temperature exceeds +165℃ (TYP), the 
device is forced to stop switching. It will recover 
automatically when TJ falls below the recovery threshold.

Design Requirements 
 A 10pF feedforward capacitor is optioned to improve the response. 
 When the output is shorted, a large input capacitor is required to ensure that the output voltage ripple is lower than 
1V, otherwise the device may not be stable. 
 To reduce the output ripple and keep the device stable, the output capacitor must be large. The recommended 
value should not be lower than 22μF + 22μF, and a 100μF output capacitor will be very helpful for reducing ripple. 
 0.1% RFB1, RFB2 will be chosen to improve the output voltage precision, if it is needed. 
 In order to obtain a small VOUT ripple, it is recommended that the VIN is higher than 7V when the VOUT is 5V, and the 
VIN is lower than 20V when the VOUT is 1.8V.
