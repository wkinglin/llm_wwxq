GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The 74AVC8T245Q is an 8-bit, dual-supply bus 
transceiver with configurable voltage translation. The 
An and Bn are 8-bit data input-output ports. DIR is the 
direction control input and OE
ത
ത
ത
ത
ത is the output enable 
input. VCCA and VCCB are dual supply pins. The supply 
voltage of VCCA and VCCB can range from 0.8V to 3.6V, 
making the device suitable for bidirectional translating 
among any of the 0.8V, 1.2V, 1.5V, 1.8V, 2.5V and 
3.3V voltage nodes. The An, DIR and OE
ത
ത
ത
ത
ത signals are 
referenced to VCCA and Bn signals are referenced to 
VCCB. 
When DIR is set high, it allows transmission from An to 
Bn. When DIR is set low, it allows transmission from Bn 
to An. OE
ത
ത
ത
ത
ത can be used to make the outputs disabled 
so that the buses are effectively isolated. In suspend 
mode, both An and Bn are in high-impedance state 
when either VCCA or VCCB input is at GND level. 
This device is highly suitable for partial power-down 
applications by using power-off leakage current (IOFF) 
circuit. When the device is powered down, the outputs 
are disabled, and the current backflow can be 
prevented from passing through the device. 
This device is AEC-Q100 qualified (Automotive 
Electronics Council Standard Q100 Grade 1) and the 
use of this device is suitable for automotive applications.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
1. Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may 
affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
2. The input and output voltage ratings may be exceeded if the 
input and output clamp current ratings are observed. 
3. The performance capability of a high-performance integrated 
circuit in conjunction with its thermal environment can create 
junction temperatures which are detrimental to reliability. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.
