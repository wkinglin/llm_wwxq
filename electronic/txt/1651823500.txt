GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM2027 is a dual, low dropout, low voltage and 
high accuracy linear regulator. It is capable of supplying 
250mA output current at each channel with typical 
dropout voltage of only 250mV. The operating input 
voltage range is from 2.5V to 5.5V. 
Other features include logic-controlled shutdown mode, 
output current limit and thermal shutdown protection. 
The SGM2027 is available in a Green TSOT-23-6 package. 
It operates over an ambient temperature range of -40℃ 
to +85℃. 
FEATURES 
● Operating Input Voltage Range: 2.5V to 5.5V 
● Output Voltage Accuracy: ±2% at +25℃

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.

NOTES: 
1. The dropout voltage is defined as VIN - VOUT, when VOUT is 100mV below the value of VOUT for VIN = VOUT + 0.5V. 
(Only applicable for VOUT = 2.5V to 3.3V) 
2. Time needed for VOUT to reach 95% of final value. 
3. Each channel provides 300mA of maximum output current when the condition of dissipating heat is good.

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
Input Capacitor Selection (CIN) 
The input decoupling capacitor is necessary to be 
connected as close as possible to the IN pin for 
ensuring the device stability. 1μF or larger X7R or X5R 
ceramic capacitor is selected to get good dynamic 
performance. 
When VIN is required to provide large current 
instantaneously, a large effective input capacitor is 
required. Multiple input capacitors can limit the input 
tracking inductance. Adding more input capacitors is 
available to restrict the ringing and to keep it below the 
device absolute maximum ratings. 
 
Output Capacitors Selection (COUT1, COUT2) 
The output decoupling capacitors should be located as 
close as possible to the OUTx pins. 1μF or larger X7R 
or X5R ceramic capacitors are selected to get good 
dynamic 
performance. 
For 
ceramic 
capacitor, 
temperature, DC bias and package size will change the 
effective capacitance, so enough margins of COUT1 and 
COUT2 
must 
be 
considered 
in 
design. 
Larger 
capacitance and lower ESR COUT1 and COUT2 will help 
improve the load transient response and increase the 
high frequency PSRR. 
 
 
Output Current Limit and Short-Circuit 
Protection 
When overload events happen, the output current is 
internally limited to 500mA (TYP). When the OUT pin is 
shorted to ground, the short-circuit protection will limit 
the output current. 
 
Thermal Shutdown 
The SGM2027 can detect the temperature of die. When 
the die temperature exceeds the threshold value of 
thermal shutdown, the SGM2027 will be in shutdown 
state and it will remain in this state until the die 
temperature decreases to +145℃. 
 
Layout Guidelines 
To get good PSRR, low output noise and high transient 
response performance, the input and output bypass 
capacitors must be placed as close as possible to the 
IN pin and OUTx pins separately. VIN and VOUT had 
better use separate ground planes and these ground 
planes are single point connected to the GND pin.
