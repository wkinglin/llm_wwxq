GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM41526 and SGM41527 are stand-alone Li-Ion and 
Li-polymer battery chargers. The PWM switches are integrated 
inside and they can automatically select the power path. They 
also include gate drivers for external power path selector 
MOSFETs. The synchronous PWM controller runs at a fixed 
frequency (1.6MHz) and is capable of providing accurate 
regulation of charge voltage, charge current and input current. 
They are capable of providing continuous battery pack 
temperature monitoring in which the charge is only allowed 
when the temperature is within the desired range. The 
SGM41526 can charge 2-, 3- or 4-cell (selected by CELL pin); 
while the SGM41527 has an adjustable charge voltage for up 
to 4 cells. In the SGM41527, the FB pin is used for charge 
voltage regulation (feedback) using an internal 2.1V reference 
and comparator. 
Typically, a full battery charging cycle has three consequent 
phases: pre-conditioning, constant current and constant 
voltage. The charge current is small during the pre-conditioning 
phase in which battery is heavily depleted. When the battery 
voltage exceeds a threshold voltage, the charge current 
increases to its maximum (fast charge current) until the battery 
voltage reaches its regulation level. Then the voltage is 
regulated and charge current drops. The starting phase is 
determined by the initial battery voltage. In constant voltage 
condition, the charge current drops automatically. When it 
decreases below 10% of the fast charge value, charging is 
terminated. A programmable safety charge timer is provided to 
prevent prolonged charging if it is not naturally terminated for 
any reason. When the battery voltage falls below recharge 
threshold, charge cycle is automatically started (or restarted). 
If the input voltage falls below the battery voltage, the device 
enters sleep mode. In sleep mode, the quiescent current is 
very low. 
The SGM41526 and SGM41527 use dynamic power 
management (DPM) to prevent overload of the input source 
(AC adaptor). With DPM, the output charge current is reduced 
if the input power limit is reached. The input current is sensed 
and controlled by a precision current-sense amplifier to limit the 
input power. 
Gate driver outputs are provided for power path selection that 
can be achieved by three external switches. Two N-type 
back-to-back MOSFETs (Q1, Q2) are used as input pair 
(adapter power in and reverse blocking control) along with a 
P-type (Q3) that is used to control the battery connection to the 
system bus. The system is powered from adapter by Q1 and 
Q2 on if a qualified adapter is present. Otherwise, the system is 
connected to the battery by Q3. And with power path control, 
the battery cannot feed back to the input. 
The SGM41526 and SGM41527 can charge the battery from a 
DC source with a voltage up to 22V. This range covers 
common adapter voltages and the car battery voltage. The 
qualified adapter range is adjustable by OVPSET pin. If the 
input voltage is out of the range, Q1 and Q2 will not be turned 
on. 
For 1-cell applications (only applicable to SGM41527), when 
the battery is not removable, the design can be simplified by 
direct connection of the battery to the system. Therefore, when 
the input source is overloaded, the battery can help power the 
system automatically. 
The SGM41526 and SGM41527 are available in a Green 
TQFN-5.5×3.5-24L package. It can operate over an ambient 
temperature range of -40℃ to +85℃.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

FUNCTION 
10 
TS 
I 
Temperature Sense Voltage Input. Connect to a negative temperature coefficient (NTC) thermistor that 
can sense the battery temperature. The actual hot and cold temperature can be set by a resistor divider 
from VREF to TS to AGND. It is recommended to use a 103AT type thermistor for battery pack 
temperature sensing.  
11 
TTC 
I 
Safety Timer (Fast Charge) and Termination Control. Pre-charge timer is fixed inside the device (30min 
typically). Fast charge safety timer is determined by the capacitor from this pin to AGND (5.6min/nF). 
Safety timer is disabled by pulling this pin low or high, but charge termination is disabled only when it is 
pulled low. 
12 
VREF 
P 
3.3V Voltage Reference Output Internally Powered from AVCC Pin. Connect a 1μF ceramic capacitor to 
AGND as close to IC as possible. It is usually connected to the resistor divider of ISET, ACSET and TS 
pins. It can also be connected to STAT and CELL pins as pull-up rail. 
13 
ISET 
I 
Program Pin for Charge Current Settings. The voltage on this pin and the charge shunt resistor RSR 
determine the fast charge current. VISET voltage can be set by a resistor divider (VREF-ISET-AGND). 
=

I
20 R
 
The pre-charge and termination currents are equal and determined by ICHG as a ratio of 10%. 
The charger disables when ISET voltage is pulled below 30mV and enables if it exceeds 120mV. 
14 
CELL 
(SGM41526) 
I 
Cell Selection Pin for SGM41526. Set it low for 4-cell battery, floating for 2-cell, and set it high for 3-cell 
battery. Cell voltage regulation is fixed at 4.2V per cell. 
FB 
(SGM41527) 
Feedback Pin for Regulating the Charge Voltage in SGM41527 in the Constant-Voltage Mode. A resistor 
divider from battery terminal (VBAT) to FB (VFB) to AGND sets the charge voltage. And the internal 
voltage reference is 2.1V. 
15 
SRN 
I 
Charge Current Sense Resistor, Negative Input. A shunt resistor is connected between SRN pin and 
SRP pin to sense charge current. Connect a 100nF ceramic capacitor between SRN pin and SRP pin 
for differential-mode filtering. Connect an optional 100nF capacitor between SRN and AGND for 
common-mode filtering. 
16 
SRP 
I/P 
Charge Current Sense Resistor, Positive Input. Connect a 100nF ceramic capacitor between SRN pin 
and SRP pin for differential-mode filtering. Connect another 100nF ceramic capacitor between SRP pin 
and AGND for common-mode filtering. 
17 
ACSET 
I 
Program Pin to Set Input Current Limit for Dynamic Power Management. A voltage divider from VREF to 
ACSET to AGND can be used to set this parameter along with the input shunt resistor RAC: 
=
×
ACSET
DPM
AC
V
I
20 R
 
18 
OVPSET 
I 
Program Pin for Input Over-Voltage Detection. The input voltage can be sensed by a resistor voltage 
divider from input to OVPSET to AGND so that the ACOV and ACUV can be realized by setting proper 
resistor. An input over-voltage (ACOV) is detected if OVPSET voltage exceeds the internal 1.6V 
reference. A voltage below 0.494V indicates an input under-voltage (ACUV). If either of the two cases 
happens, both of the ACFET and RBFET will be turned off. If it is in charging process, the charge will 
terminate. Then the LED that is connected to STAT pin will blink at 1Hz to indicate a fault. 
19 
nBATDRV 
O 
Gate Driver Output for External P-Type Power MOSFET (Battery Discharge Path). Use a 1kΩ resistor to 
connect this pin to the gate of the BATFET (Q3) to control the turn-on speed. The source of the BATFET 
connects to the system and the drain connects to the battery positive terminal. In order to decrease 
inrush current, the internal gate driver is designed with quick turn-off and slow turn-on functions. 
This gate driver has break-before-make logic with respect to the ACDRV gate driver (input switch). 
20 
REGN 
P 
5V Internal Supply for the PWM Low-side Switch Driver. Decouple with a 1μF ceramic capacitor from 
REGN pin to PGND pin close to the IC. Anode of integrated bootstrap diode is connected to this pin. 
21 
BTST 
P 
High-side Power MOSFET Driver Power Supply. Connect a 47nF bootstrap capacitor from SW to BTST. 
22, 23 
PGND 
P 
Device Power Ground. On the PCB layout, connect this pin directly to ground points of the input and 
output capacitors of the charger. PGND connects to AGND only through in one point on thermal pad 
under the IC. 
EP 
AGND 
P 
Exposed Pad Beneath the IC. Always solder thermal pad to the board. Use vias to transfer heat to the 
back side and other layers of PCB. Thermal pad acts as AGND and only connects to PGND at one 
single point. 
 
NOTE:

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
The SGM41526 and SGM41527 are Li-Ion and Li-polymer 
fixed-frequency synchronous PWM battery chargers with 
integrated switching power MOSFETs. Using external 
switches, power path management is provided along with 
accurate regulation of the input current, charge current and 
battery voltage. The internal block diagram is given in Figure 2. 
 
Battery Voltage Regulation 
An accurate PWM voltage regulator is used for charge 
voltage regulation. For the SGM41526, the number of battery 
cells depends on the CELL pin. Two (CELL = floating), three 
(CELL = VREF) or four (CELL = AGND) cells can be 
connected in series with a fixed nominal voltage of 4.2V per 
cell. Table 1 shows the charge regulation voltage in each 
case. 
Table 1. Defining Number of Battery Cells for SGM41526 
 
For the SGM41527, the regulation voltage is adjustable. The 
FB voltage is compared to an internal 2.1V voltage reference 
like a conventional voltage regulator. The regulation voltage 
can be adjusted by using an external resistor divider on the 
battery voltage (output voltage). Connect the center point of 
the resistor divider to the FB pin. The battery regulation 
voltage (VBAT) in the SGM41527 is calculated by Equation 1:

Battery Current Regulation 
The maximum charging current for fast charge is set by the 
ISET input. Connect battery current sense resistor (RSR) 
between SRP and SRN. The equation for charge current is 
given by:

(2) 
The maximum of the full-scale SRP-SRN differential voltage 
is 40mV, and it determines the maximum charge current 
selected by ISET. The maximum valid input voltage of ISET is 
0.8V. For example, with a 10mΩ sense resistor, the maximum 
adjustable charge current is 4A, and with a 20mΩ resistor, it is 
2A. If VISET = 0.5V and RSR = 10mΩ, the fast charge current is 
ICHG = 2.5A. 
Pulling the ISET voltage down to ground (below 30mV) 
disables the charger. To enable the charger, the ISET voltage 
should exceed 120mV. The minimum charge current is limited 
by the 120mV threshold level. For example, when RSR = 
10mΩ, the minimum fast charge current is no less than 600mA. 
As a protective feature, if the device junction temperature 
exceeds +120 ℃, the charge current folds back and is 
internally reduced to keep the junction temperature below 
+120℃. 
 
Pre-Charge Phase 
If the battery voltage is lower than VLOWV when the device is 
powered up, the charge will start with a small pre-charge 
current to safely recover the battery from deep discharge 
state. If the battery voltage still does not exceed the VLOWV 
threshold after 30 minutes, charging will stop, and fault status 
will be declared by the status pins. VLOWV is typically 2.9V/cell 
for SGM41526 and 1.46V on FB pin for SGM41527. The 
pre-charge current is determined by the fast charge current 
as a ratio of 10%:

Typical Charge Cycle 
Figure 3 shows a complete charge cycle profile (battery 
voltage and current versus time) with all the three phases 
followed by a typical discharge and auto recharge. The 
charge is started assuming that the battery is in a deep 
discharge state (low battery voltage). After termination and 
stopping the charge, the battery is normally discharged by 
system loads. When the voltage falls below the recharge 
threshold, another cycle is initiated from fast charge, to bring 
the battery back to the full charge state. A new charging cycle 
begins when any of the following conditions is met: 
• The SRN pin voltage falls below the recharge threshold (VRECH). 
• A power-on-reset (POR). 
• Disable and enable charge by pulling ISET pin below 30mV 
and then above 120mV, respectively. 
Depending on the battery voltage, the charge is started with 
the proper phase. Charge sequence details will be explained 
in the next sections.

Regulation of the Input Current 
The input current is used to power the system and to charge 
the battery. System current may vary from zero to maximum 
load. With dynamic power management (DPM) capability, the 
adapter does not need to be designed for maximum power 
demand for both charge and system at the same time. 
Otherwise it will lead to a bulky AC adapter and relatively 
higher cost. With DPM, the charge current is reduced when 
the system has high demand for power, such that the input 
current is regulated to a predefined maximum. Therefore, the 
AC adapter can be designed for lower power that results in 
smaller adapter size and cost. 
Input current regulation level of DPM is programmed by the 
voltage on ACSET pin and the input shunt resistor RAC, as 
given in Equation 4: 
=
×

(4) 
The sense voltage across RAC (typically 10mΩ) is sent to ACP 
and ACN pins. The regulation accuracy can be improved with 
larger sense resistor but at the cost of lower efficiency. 
 
Termination, Recharge and Timers 
In the constant voltage charging phase, the device also 
detects the charging current and battery voltage. The charge 
cycle will be terminated if the battery is fully charged that is 
detected when charge voltage exceeds recharge threshold 
(VRECH) and charge current falls below termination current 
threshold (ITERM). Charge voltage is sensed on the SRN pin of 
the SGM41526 and on the FB pin of the SGM41527. 
Recharge voltage threshold (VRECH) is a little bit lower than 
the regulation voltage and the termination current threshold 
(ITERM) is equal to 10% of the programmed fast charge current 
as given in Equation 5:

(5) 
For battery safety, prolonged charging must be avoided, so 
time limits are considered for charge phases. For pre-charge 
phase, a fixed 30-minute safety timer is employed. For the 
fast charge phase, an adjustable timer is used. This timer can 
be programmed by a capacitor (CTTC) connected between the 
TTC and AGND pins based on Equation 6: 
tTTC (min) = CTTC (nF) × KTTC (min/nF)      (6) 
where KTTC is a constant typically equal to 5.6min/nF. 
Connecting TCC pin to AGND disables both termination and 
fast charge timers. Connecting TCC pin to VREF disables the 
safety timer only and termination timer remains functioning.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Device Power-Up 
The device power pin (AVCC) can be supplied by the battery 
or the adapter. If AVCC voltage falls below UVLO threshold, 
the device remains disabled. If AVCC voltage exceeds UVLO 
threshold, the device is enabled and another comparator 
(charger sleep comparator) checks the AVCC voltage to 
identify the power source. If the adapter is detected and the 
AVCC voltage exceeds the SRN voltage (battery voltage), the 
charger exits the sleep mode and can be enabled for 
charging. If the AVCC voltage is lower than SRN, the charger 
enters the low quiescent current sleep mode to minimize 
power taken from the battery. In the sleep mode, the STAT pin 
goes to high-impedance state and VREF output is turned off. 
 
AVCC Input Under-Voltage Lockout (UVLO) 
Usually the system cannot properly operate if AVCC voltage 
is too low (under-voltage). Therefore the device is enabled 
until AVCC voltage exceeds a minimum level (UVLO). All 
circuits on the IC are disabled if AVCC falls below UVLO 
threshold, regardless of the source of power. 
 
Input Over-Voltage/Under-Voltage Protection 
The SGM41526 and SGM41527 provide over-voltage (OV) 
and under-voltage (UV) protections to avoid system damage 
due to high or low input supply voltage. The input is qualified 
if input voltage is within the UV and OV window. The ACOV 
and ACUV comparators monitor the OVPSET voltage. If it 
exceeds 1.6V (for OV) or falls below 0.494V (for UV), the 
charge will be disabled and both input switches (Q1 and Q2) 
will be turned off to disconnect the system from the power 
supply. A resistor divider from input source can be used to 
define the input qualification window. Unlike UVLO that acts 
on AVCC (powered from input supply or battery), the OV and 
UV protections act only on the input power supply. 
 
Charge Enable and Disable 
If all following conditions are fulfilled, a charge will be started: 
• VISET > 120mV (enable charge). 
• VAVCC > VUVLO (device not in UVLO). 
• VAVCC > VSRN (charger not in sleep mode). 
• 0.494V < VOVPSET < 1.6V (qualified power input). 
• Not in Thermal Shutdown (TSHUT). 
• No TS fault (battery temperature not too hot or cold). 
• Detect battery presence. 
• ACFET is turned on. 
• TTC or pre-charge timers are not expired. 
• REGN and VREF pins are at their normal voltage levels 
without overloading. 
The device remains charging until the battery is fully charged 
(normal termination), unless the charge is disabled when 
VISET < 30mV or when any of the above conditions is not 
fulfilled during the charge. 
 
Power Path Selection 
The SGM41526 and SGM41527 can automatically select the 
input adapter or battery as power source for the system. By 
default, the system is powered from the battery during device 
power-up or in sleep mode. The device can exit sleep mode if 
a qualified adapter is plugged in. Then the BATFET is turned 
off and the back-to-back MOSFET pair on the power input is 
turned on with a protective break-before-make logic so that 
system is connected to adaptor. The ACFET turns on after 
10μs dead time when BATFET is turned off, so that it avoids 
direct input to battery short that can cause over-current 
through the selector switches. 
Both gates of the back-to-back MOSFET pair on the power 
input are driven by the ACDRV pin. The sources are 
connected together to the CMSRC pin (Figure 1). The drain of 
the RBFET (Q2) is connected to the ACP pin. Q2 is for 
reverse discharge protection to avoid current flow from the 
battery to the input source. Low RDS(ON) switches are 
recommended for Q1 and Q2 to minimize conduction losses 
and heat generation. ACFET (Q1) can control the connection 
of adapter to system and battery. This switch also limits the 
inrush current rise/fall rate (di/dt) when input adapter is 
connected to the system by controlling the turn-on time.  
The BATFET (P-channel, Q3) controls the connection of 
battery and system. Its gate is driven by nBATDRV pin and its 
source is connected to system. 
The ACFET remains off, as long as a qualified voltage is not 
detected, by applying zero gate-source voltage. ACFET 
separates the adapter from system. 
If the device is not in UVLO and system voltage is at most 
0.18V above the battery, the BATFET remains on by applying 
-5.9V to the gate-source through the nBATDRV pin (gate 
voltage clamps to ground if the system voltage is less than 
5.9V). The conditions can be represented as: 
• VAVCC > VUVLO (not in UVLO). 
• VACN < VSRN + 180mV. 
The source pin of the BATFET is connected to the system, 
ACN pin and PVCC.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
If the input voltage is qualified and AVCC voltage is at least 
0.21V above SRN (battery), the device can exit the sleep 
mode and transfer the system from battery to adapter. With 
the break-before-make logic, there is a 10μs dead time 
between input MOSFET pair and BATFET. At first the 
BATFET is turned off to disconnect battery from system by 
pulling up the nBATDRV voltage to ACN pin. Then the ACFET 
is turned on with a 5.6V gate drive voltage between the 
ACDRV and CMSRC pins, which is provided by an internal 
charge pump. The conditions for connecting the adapter to 
the system can be represented as follows:  
• VACUV < VOVPSET < VACOV. 
• VAVCC > VSRN + 210mV. 
When any of above conditions is no longer valid, ACFET is 
turned off and the device enters the sleep mode. BATFET 
remains off until the system voltage falls close to SRN 
(battery voltage). Then the BATFET turns on and connects 
the battery and system. An internal regulator drives 
nBATDRV pin to ACN - 5.9V to turn on BATFET. 
Asymmetrical gate driving is used for fast turn-off and slow 
turn-on of the ACFET and BATFET. This will allow smooth 
transitions and soft connection of the system to the supply 
line. Turn-on delay can be increased by adding capacitance 
between the gate and source of the switches. 
 
Charge Converter 
The charge converter in SGM41526/7 is a 1.6MHz PWM 
step-down regulator. The fixed switching frequency makes 
the filter design simple under all input/output or temperature 
conditions. Pulse skipping occurs if the duty cycle is 
approximately 97%. A type III compensation network is 
designed inside so that the use of low ESR ceramic 
capacitors on the output is allowed. The compensated error 
amplifier output is compared with 1.6MHz sawtooth ramp 
voltage to generate PWM wave. The sawtooth amplitude is 
proportionally 
adjusted 
to 
the 
AVCC 
voltage 
(input 
feedforward) to compensate the impact of the input voltage 
variations on the loop gain and simplify the loop 
compensation.  
 
Internal Charge Current Soft-Start 
The charge current automatically soft starts when fast charge 
mode begins to limit the stress on the converter components 
due to the current overshoots. During the soft-start, a total of 
8 current levels are available for the programmed regulation 
current with an evenly spaced step. Each step lasts almost 
1.6ms, for a typical soft-tart rise time of 12.8ms. This function 
is designed inside the device and no external components are 
required. 
 
Charge Over-Current Protection 
The high-side MOSFET current in the converter is always 
monitored by a sense FET and if it exceeds the MOSFET 
current limit (typically 10A), the high-side MOSFET is turned 
off until the next cycle. 
There is another over-current protection for charge current. 
When it exceeds 180% of the programmed value, the 
high-side MOSFET is also turned off until the current falls 
below the threshold. 
 
Charge Negative Current Protection 
When the battery is charged, the inductor current reduces 
and may become negative. This negative current means that 
the battery feeds energy to input through converter (it is 
called Boost effect). The Boost effect can cause over-voltage 
on the input circuit and AVCC, which can damage the input 
components, device itself and the system. To prevent the 
boosting and negative charge current, the low-side switch 
should be turned off before the current drops to zero. The 
device senses the charge current by the voltage of the 
SRP-SRN, and if it falls below 5mV, the low-side switch is 
turned off for the rest of the switching cycle. This leads to 
discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) operation of the 
converter. Keeping low-side switch off limits the charging of 
bootstrap capacitor that feeds the high-side switch gate driver. 
A comparator always checks the high-side driver supply 
voltage, and if it falls below 2.8V the low-side switch is turned 
on for a short period to refresh and recharge the bootstrap 
capacitor voltage. This protection overrides the negative 
charge current protection.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Battery Detection 
Battery presence detection is important and specially needed 
for the applications with removable batteries. The SGM41526 
and SGM41527 use a reliable detection method for battery 
absence, battery insertion and battery removal. This detection 
procedure runs during power-up or when the battery voltage 
is lower than the recharge threshold. A low voltage on SRN 
pin (that connects to battery) can be detected due to battery 
discharge or battery removal. The detection process is 
designed such that the large capacitors on the charger output 
are not detected as battery. The detection flow chart is given 
in Figure 4. 
Battery detection starts by applying a 9.5mA sink current 
though the SRN pin to the battery at power-up or when the 
SRN voltage falls below recharge threshold. If the battery 
voltage does not fall below the battery LOWV threshold in 1s, 
the battery is detected as present so the 9.5mA sink is turned 
off and the charge starts. During the 1s period, the 9.5mA 
discharge current is disabled as long as the battery voltage 
falls below battery LOWV threshold. Then the converter 
generates a small charge current to charge the SRN pin. The 
charge current is 250mA typically with 10mΩ sense resistor. 
Now, if 0.5s timer times out and the battery voltage exceeds 
the recharge threshold, the detection is no-battery and the 
process will restart from beginning to detect insertion of the 
battery. If after the 0.5s period, the voltage does not exceed 
the recharge voltage threshold, the battery is detected as 
present and the proper charging phase will start.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Note that the total output capacitance that appears parallel to 
the battery should not be too large such that with the applied 
sink or charge currents and timing the no-battery voltage 
changes fast and passes the detection thresholds within 1s or

        (9) 
Therefore, the total capacitance on the battery node should 
be less than 2800μF. 
 
Battery Short Protection 
During charge, if the battery voltage sensed on the SRN pin 
falls below 2V threshold, the battery is considered in short 
condition. The charge will quickly stop for a 1ms period 
followed by a soft-start toward the pre-charge current level to 
prevent over-current and saturation of the inductor. In battery 
short condition, the charger operates in nonsynchronous 
mode. 
 
Battery Over-Voltage Protection 
Battery voltage is continuously monitored for over-voltage 
protection. If the sensed voltage exceeds 104% of the 
regulation voltage, the converter high-side switch remains off. 
This protection reacts in one cycle. The over-voltage may 
occur due to a battery disconnection or load removal. The 
stored energy in the output capacitors is discharged by 
sinking a total of 6mA current through SRP and SRN pins to 
AGND. The charge will be disabled if the over-voltage 
condition is not cleared for more than 30ms. 
 
Battery Temperature Qualification 
Battery temperature is continuously monitored by measuring 
the voltage between the TS pin and AGND that is sensed by a 
NTC (negative temperature coefficient) thermistor attached to 
the battery pack. A resistor divider from VREF is used to 
adjust the temperature limits. The voltage of TS pin is 
compared with internal thresholds and charge process will not 
begin until the TS pin voltage (which indicates battery 
temperature) is within the VLTF to VHTF window. If during 
charge the battery get too hot or too cold and temperature 
goes out of the allowed range, the charge will suspend by 
turning off PWM switches. The charge resumes automatically 
if the temperature returns to the allowed window. 
Figure 6 illustrates the temperature qualification function and 
the thresholds for the charge initiation, suspension and 
recovery.

MOSFET and Inductor Protection in Short 
Circuit Condition 
The SGM41526 and SGM41527 provide cycle-by-cycle short 
circuit protection by monitoring the voltage drop across RDS(ON) 
of the MOSFETs. If a short is detected, the charger will be 
latched off, which means the Buck converter is disabled but 
the ACFET will not be turned off, and system is still connected 
to the adaptor. Latch-off state can only be removed by 
unplugging and re-plugging the input power (adapter). The 
LED connected to STAT pin blinks at this condition. 
 
Thermal Regulation and Shutdown 
The low thermal impedance of the TQFN package provides 
good cooling for the silicon. When the junction temperature 
exceeds +120℃, the thermal regulation is triggered. Then the 
device will decrease charge current to reduce internal heat 
generation. Moreover, if the junction temperature exceeds the 
shutdown level (TSHUT = +150℃), charger is turned off and 
will not resume until TJ falls below +130℃. 
Recovery from Timer Fault 
If a charge timer fault occurs, the device recovery process will 
depend on the battery voltage as follows. 
Case 1: If VBAT exceeds the recharge threshold when the 
time-out fault occurs, the charge will be suspended firstly. 
When the battery voltage falls below recharge threshold, the 
battery detection begins again, and then the timer fault is 
cleared. The fault will also clear by a power-on-reset (POR) or 
by pulling the ISET voltage below 30mV. 
Case 2: If VBAT falls below the recharge threshold when the 
timer fault occurs, a small charge current is applied to detect 
the battery removal at first. The small charge current is not

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Device Functional Modes 
The SGM41526 and SGM41527 are stand-alone switching 
chargers and power path selectors. They operate from a 
qualified adapter or DC supply system. This device is capable 
of providing dynamic power management (DPM mode) to 
reduce the input loading by sharing the load with the battery 
on the peak system demands. Because of DPM capability, 
the adaptor size and power rating can be reduced effectively 
for the systems with highly dynamic loads. 
The gate drive pins for power path selector switches (ACDRV 
and CMSRC) control the input NMOS pair, ACFET (Q1) and 
RBFET (Q2). The nBATDRV pin controls the gate of the 
battery connection PMOS switch (Q3). If the input (adapter) is 
qualified, system will be connected to the input by turning Q1 
and Q2 on. Otherwise, Q3 will be turned on then the system 
is powered from battery. Moreover, the battery cannot feed 
back to the input with power path selection control. 
DPM capability is included in the SGM41526 and SGM41527 
to limit maximum power taken from the input (adapter) by 
reducing the charge current when the system power demand 
is high. Input current is accurately sensed to monitor power 
usage. Without DPM, the adapter must be designed to 
provide maximum charge power plus maximum system power. 
However, with DPM, the adapter can be designed for 
significantly lower power rating that reduces the size and cost 
of the adapter. 
The SGM41526 and SGM41527 can operate independently. 
However, some pin settings can be adjusted by an external 
controller 
(like 
ISET 
or 
ACSET). 
This 
allows 
the 
implementation of ″battery learn mode″ for applications with 
dynamic charging conditions.

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
SGM41526 and SGM41527 can be used in portable 
applications with up to 4-cell Li-Ion or Li-polymer batteries. 
The SGM41526 accurately regulates the battery voltage at a 
fixed 4.2V/cell value (minimum 2 cells) and with low leakage 
from battery. Number of cells is programmable by CELL pin. 
For the applications that need custom battery regulation 
voltage or use only one cell, the SGM41527 can be used. In 
this variant, the battery regulation voltage is adjustable 
through the FB pin similar to a conventional voltage regulator. 
Figure 9 shows a typical application circuit of the SGM41526 
with a 2-cell battery (8.4V). 
For power input, an adapter or power supply from 4.5V to 22V 
is needed generally. The minimum voltage range depends on 
the number of battery cells. Typically, the adapter current 
rating should be 500mA and higher.

APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued) 
Inductor Selection 
Small inductors and capacitors can be used in this design due 
to the high switching frequency of the device (fSW = 1.6MHz). 
The inductor should not saturate at the highest current that 
occurs at maximum charge current plus half peak value of the 
ripple current as given in Equation 13: 
ISAT ≥ ICHG + (1/2)IRIPPLE             (13) 
where ICHG is the charging current, and IRIPPLE is the ripple 
current magnitude (peak-to-peak of the AC component). 
Except for light loads, the inductor current is continuous and 
the IRIPPLE is determined by the following equation:

              (14) 
where VIN is the input voltage, D = VOUT/VIN is duty cycle, and 
L is the inductance value. 
Usually the highest ripple current is generated when duty 
cycle is equal to or near 0.5. Inductor current ripple is typically 
chosen to be 20% to 40% of the full load DC current to get a 
reasonable compromise between inductor size and AC losses. 
Higher ripple results in smaller inductor but with lower 
efficiency. The highest input voltage and charge current ranges 
should be considered for inductor design. Consider 30% 
ripple for this design (IRIPPLE ≤ 0.3ICHG):

Or L ≥ 2.9μH. 
The initial tolerance of the commercial inductors is usually 
quite large (typically 10% - 20% and in some cases as high as 
30%). The inductance also drops with higher currents 
(typically in the order of 20% at maximum current). Therefore, 
a good margin must be considered for selection of the 
inductor value by consideration of the initial tolerance, 
thermal and maximum current drops from the inductor 
datasheet. For this example, a 3.3μH inductor is considered. 
 
L = 3.3μH (nominal value of the inductor)

Inductor core type and form factor can be designed based on 
the required size, loss, magnetic noise coupling, cost, stock 
availability and reliability considerations. 
 
Input Path Capacitors 
The input capacitors carry two types of AC currents: (1) the 
converter switching ripple currents and (2) the high frequency 
(HF) transient currents of the switching. High frequency 
decoupling capacitors are necessary to prevent voltage 
ringing due to HF currents. Usually some bulk capacitance is 
needed to avoid large input rail voltage ripples. Typically, a 
ceramic capacitor placed close to the switching leg (PVCC 
and PGND) is sufficient to circulate the switching frequency 
and high frequency AC currents. This capacitor needs to have 
low ESR and ESL. The capacitor self-resonance frequency 
should be selected well above switching frequency. 
Otherwise, it will not be able to bypass HF switching transient 
currents and large ringing noise may be seen on the PVCC. A 
combination of smaller size and larger size capacitors may be 
used for better noise suppression. Stable ceramic capacitors 
such as X5R or X7R are recommended. All capacitors should 
be able to carry the peak RMS current of the ripples. Input 
capacitor ripple current (ICIN) can be calculated from Equation 
16:

D
1-D               (16) 
The highest ripple occurs at D = 0.5 and the worst case RMS 
ripple current is 0.5ICHG (2A for this example). 
Due to the capacitance drop at higher DC voltage bias and 
aging, a good margin should be considered for selection of 
the capacitor voltage rating. For a 20V maximum input, a 25V 
capacitor works. However, a 35V or higher voltage capacitor 
is recommended. For a high current (3A ~ 4A) charger, a 
minimum of 20μF input capacitance is recommended. For 
lower currents (1A or less), 10μF capacitance is sufficient. 
 
Output Capacitor Selection 
Applying a charge current with high ripple will deteriorate the 
battery lifetime and generate extra loss and heat. Therefore, it 
is important to bypass the inductor ripple using output 
capacitors and to keep the voltage ripple low, allowing only 
the DC current to flow and charge the battery. The output 
capacitors should have enough RMS current rating to carry 
the worst-case current ripples. The output RMS current (ICOUT) 
can be calculated as:

APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued) 
The ripple can be reduced by decreasing the cut-off 
frequency of the LC filter (

r

LC
). The SGM41526 and 
SGM41527 internal loop compensator is designed for a 
cut-off frequency of 15kHz to 25kHz. Therefore, in order to 
achieve good loop stability, select the output capacitor such 
that LC filter cut-off frequency is in the specified range. Stable 
ceramic capacitors (like X5R or X7R) are recommended with 
enough margin for the rated voltage (25V or higher). 
Selecting COUT = 20μF (two parallel 10μF) will result in fr = 
19.6kHz with the selected L = 3.3μH inductor. 
 
Input Filter Design 
Most portable applications must be able to handle hot adapter 
plug-in and removal. The parasitic line inductance of the 
adapter and the input capacitors of the charger form a 
second-order LC circuit that may create a transient 
over-voltage on the AVCC and damage the device. So careful 
design of the input filter with proper damping is important to 
assure the voltage peaks are well below the device limit. A 
common method is using a high ESR electrolytic input 
capacitor to damp the over-voltage spike. A TVS Zener diode 
with high current capability may also be used on the AVCC 
pin to clamp the transient peaks. If a more flexible and 
compact solution is needed, the input filter shown in Figure 10 
can be used. In this network, RiCi filter damps the hot-plug 
oscillations and limits the over-voltage spikes to a safe level. 
D1 provides reverse voltage protection if a reverse polarity 
adapter is mistakenly connected or when the battery is also 
feeding AVCC. Ca is the decoupling capacitor of the AVCC that 
is placed right beside the AVCC and AGND pins. RaCa filter 
provides more damping and reduction of the dv/dt and 
magnitude of voltage spike. Ra also serves as a current limiter. 
Ca is typically less than the Ci, so Ri dominates in the total 
equivalent ESR for damping of hot plug-in spikes. Ri and Ra 
should have sufficient package size and power rating to 
dissipate inrush current losses without overheating. A final test 
is recommended to assure all requirements are satisfied in the 
worst conditions and to make the necessary adjustments. 
 
Figure 10. Input Filter 
 
Selecting Input Switch Pair (ACFET and 
RBFET) 
Low RDS(ON), N-type MOSFETs are used for ACFET(Q1) and 
RBFET(Q2) as shown in Figure 11. Due to the relatively large 
amount of capacitance on the system power rail, PVCC and 
charger output, a large inrush current can flow in the switches 
if it is not managed properly. Slow turn-on of Q1 can reduce 
the inrush current. MOSFETs with relatively large drain-gate 
and gate-source parasitic capacitances (CGD and CGS) have 
slower turn-on time. External capacitors may be used if Q1 
turn-on is not slow enough. As an example, external CGD = 
4.7nF and CGS = 47nF can be used across Q1. Current and 
power rating of these switches should be selected with good 
margin compared to the maximum current from the adapter.

Layout Guidelines 
A good PCB layout is critical for proper operation of the 
switching circuits. A list of important considerations for 
SGM41526 and SGM41527 layout design are provided here: 
1. The switching node (SW) creates very high frequency 
noises several times higher than fSW (1.6MHz) due to sharp 
rise and fall times of the voltage and current in the switches. 
To reduce the ringing issues and noise generation, it is 
important to minimize impedance and loop area of the AC 
current paths. A graphical guideline for the current loops and 
their frequency content is provided in Figure 15. 
2. Input and other decoupling capacitors must be placed as 
close to the device pin and ground as possible with the 
shortest copper trace and on the same layer of PCB. 
3. Surface area of the SW node should be minimized to 
reduce capacitive HF noise coupling. Use a short and wide 
track connection to the inductor on the same layer of PCB. 
Keep sensitive and high impedance traces away from 
switching node and trace. 
4. Place the charge current-sense resistor right next to the 
inductor and use the same layer of PCB for routing them to 
the device amplifier input while keeping them close together 
and away from high current paths. 
Figure 16 shows the proper Kelvin connection of shunt 
resistors for accurate current sensing. Use decoupling 
capacitors at the point of connection to the device (between 
sense traces and between one of them and AGND). 
5. Output capacitors should be placed right next to the sense 
resistor. 
6. Keep input and output capacitor ground returns tied together 
and on the same layer before connecting them to the device 
PGND. Having all of them connected in a small geometric 
area right beside the device is highly recommended. 
7. Keep AGND separated from PGND and connect them only 
in a single point under the device body and connect it to the 
thermal pad. Use AGND copper pour only under the device. A 
0Ω resistor can be used for single point connection of AGND 
and PGND. Make connections to AGND with star geometry. 
8. For proper cooling of the device, use several thermal vias 
connecting the thermal pad pour to the GND plane on the 
opposite side and other layers of the PCB. Use enough solder 
for thermal pad connections. Open via holes allow solder to 
penetrate to the other side and provide low thermal resistance. 
Apply solder to the opposite side thermal ground for better 
connection to the vias and better thermal cooling. Thermal 
ground should not be connected to PGND planes. 
9. Remember that vias add some parasitic impedance 
(resistive/inductive) to the trace. So, it is generally 
recommended to avoid vias in the sensitive or high frequency 
paths.
