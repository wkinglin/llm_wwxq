GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM3741B is a high efficiency constant-current 
white LED driver with a 600kHz boost DC/DC converter. 
With an internal 38V/2.2A power MOSFET, the 
SGM3741B supports up to 10 white LEDs in series and 
achieves uniform brightness. The SGM3741B supports 
two PWM signals to control the backlight brightness. 
The PWM frequency is in the range from 2kHz to 
60kHz, thus avoiding audible noise from inductor or 
ceramic capacitor. Combining the two PWM signals 
gets very wide brightness dimming range. The PWM 
pin is always used for Content Adaptive Brightness 
Control (CABC). 
The supply voltage operates from 3V to 18V and is well 
suited for various applications powered by 1-cell or 
2-cell batteries. 
The SGM3741B includes a comprehensive set of 
protection features such as 38.5V over-voltage 
protection, cycle-by-cycle current limit and thermal 
shutdown. Built-in soft-start circuitry avoids excessive 
inrush current during startup. 
The SGM3741B is available in a Green TQFN-3×3-16L 
package. It operates over an ambient temperature 
range of -40℃ to +85℃.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.
