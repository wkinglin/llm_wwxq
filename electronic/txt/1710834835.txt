GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM61061 device is a 2.8V to 5.5V synchronous 
Buck converter with constant off-time architecture that 
is optimized solution for high efficiency and compact 
size. The device integrates switches capable of 
delivering an output current up to 6A. 
When MODE input is lower than 0.4V or floating, 
SGM61061 enters into a pulse frequency modulation 
(PFM) mode. At medium to heavy loads, the device 
operates in pulse width modulation (PWM) mode with 
1.4MHz (TYP) switching frequency. At light loads, the 
device automatically enters in power-save mode (PSM) 
to maintain high efficiency over the entire load current 
range. When MODE input voltage is more than 1.2V, 
SGM61061 enters into a pulse width modulation (PWM) 
mode over the entire load current range. In shutdown 
state, the current consumption is reduced to 0.02μA 
(TYP). 
The SGM61061 can dynamic regulate output voltage 
by MODE/VCON pin to meet some situations need 
change output voltage directly. When MOED/VCON pin 
get an appropriate voltage value (from 0.6V to 1.1V), 
SGM61061 will work in PWM mode and internal 
reference voltage changes smoothly to achieve a new 
output voltage without changing external resistor 
divider. 
The SGM61061 is available in a Green TQFN-2×3-12L 
package.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
can cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods can 
affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits can be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes have a probability of 
causing the device not to meet the published specifications.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
Overview 
The SGM61061 is a high efficiency synchronous Buck 
switching converter. The device operates in an adaptive 
off-time with peak current control scheme. The device 
operates at a typically 1.4MHz switching frequency to 
regulate the output voltage and uses the off-time PWM 
control for the moderate to heavy load currents. Based 
on the VIN/VOUT ratio, a simple circuit sets the required 
off-time for the high-side MOSFET. It makes the 
switching frequency relatively constant regardless of 
the variation of input voltage, output voltage, and load 
current at PWM state. 
 
Under-Voltage Lockout (UVLO) 
To avoid mis-operation of the device at low input 
voltages, under-voltage lockout is implemented that 
shuts down the device when input voltage lower than 
VUVLO (when VIN voltage falls) with 300mV hysteresis. 
When the input voltage is higher than 2.55V, the device 
will recover to normal operation. 
 
Soft-Start and Pre-biased Output 
A 1.3ms internal soft-start circuit is included to prevent 
input inrush current and input voltage drops during 
startup. This circuit slowly ramps up the error amplifier 
reference voltage (VREF = 0.6V) after exiting the 
shutdown state or under-voltage lockout (UVLO). Slow 
increase of the output voltage prevents the excessive 
inrush current for charging the output capacitors and 
creates a smooth output voltage rise. The other 
advantage of a soft-start is avoiding supply voltage 
drops especially on the high internal impedance 
sources such as the primary cells and rechargeable 
batteries.  
The SGM61061 is also capable of starting with a 
pre-biased output capacitor when it is powered up or 
enabled. When the device is turning on, a bias on the 
output is likely to exist due to the other sources 
connected to the load(s) such as multi-voltage ICs or 
simply because of residual charges on the output 
capacitors. For example, when a device with light load 
is disabled and re-enabled, the output voltage cannot 
drop too much during the off period and the device 
must restart under pre-biased output condition. Without 
the pre-biased capability, the device cannot be able to 
start up properly. The output ramp is automatically 
initiated to the bias voltage and ramps up to the 
nominal output value. 
 
Device Enable and Disable 
The SGM61061 is enabled by setting the EN pin input 
to higher than 1.2V. It is disabled when EN pin falls 
lower than 0.4V. If the device is enabled, the internal 
power stage starts switching and regulates the output 
voltage to the setting point voltage.  
In shutdown mode, the internal power switches as well 
as the entire control circuitry are turned off. The output 
discharge FET is turned on. 
 
Power Good Output (PG) 
The SGM61061 has a power good output. The PG pin 
is pulled to high-level once FB voltage reaches 90% of 
the reference voltage, and is driven low once FB 
voltage falls below typically 85% of the reference 
voltage. If the FB voltage is higher than 115% of the 
reference voltage, the PG pin becomes low, then the 
FB voltage is reduced to 110% of the reference voltage, 
and the PG pin is pulled to the high-level. The PG pin is 
an open-drain output with internal pull-up resistor 
connected to VIN. It is recommended that the sink 
current should not exceed 1mA. There is a 150μs delay 
between when VFB reaches PG threshold to when the 
PG pin is pulled to high. The PG signal can be used for 
sequencing of multiple rails by connecting it to the EN 
pin of other converters. Leave the PG pin unconnected 
when not used.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Power-Save Mode 
At light load conditions, the SGM61061 shifts to the 
power-save mode to reduce the switching frequency 
and minimize the losses. It also shuts down most of the 
internal circuits in power-save mode. In this mode, one 
or more PWM pulses are sent to charge the output 
capacitor and then the switches are kept off. The output 
capacitor voltage gradually drops due to small load 
current and when it falls below the nominal voltage 
threshold, the PWM pulses resume. If the load is still 
low, the output will go slightly higher than normal value 
again and the switches will be turned off. In power-save 
mode, the output voltage is slightly higher than nominal 
output voltage. This effect can be mitigated by a larger 
output capacitor. 
 
Low Dropout Operation (100% Duty Cycle) 
When the input voltage gradually drops to the 
regulation output voltage, the SGM61061 can operate 
at 100% duty cycle and keep the high-side MOSFET 
continuously on for minimal input-to-output voltage 
difference. The low-side MOSFET is kept off. In this 
mode, the lowest input voltage for keeping the output 
regulated is determined by load current and the 
resistive drops from the input to the output as given in 
Equation 1:

where:  
VIN_MIN is minimum input voltage to maintain output 
voltage in regulation.  
IOUT_MAX is maximum output current.  
RDSON is high-side MOSFET on-resistance.  
RL is inductor DC resistance (DCR). 
 
Mode Switch and Output Voltage Dynamic 
Regulation 
This device can switch between PWM and PFM work 
modes. SGM61061 switches to PWM mode if the 
MODE/VCON pin voltage is more than 1.2V. Once 
MODE/VCON pin voltage falls below 0.4V or floats, 
SGM61061 will switch to PFM mode which keeps the 
high efficiency in the whole load range. Although the 
efficiency is low when load is light in PWM mode, the 
VO ripple is low and the frequency is relatively fixed.  
When output voltage need to change in operation, it 
can be regulated by MODE/VCON pin. Internal 
reference 
voltage 
will 
increase 
linearly 
with 
MODE/VCON pin voltage changes from 0.6V to 1.1V, 
as Figure 3. It should be noted that if this function is 
used, the VCON pin must to be powered first. Output 
voltage changes without changing external resistor 
divider and SGM61061 will switch to PWM mode. The 
accuracy is 3% typically and the range of VREF voltage 
regulation is from 0.35V to 0.6V in VCON function. The 
accuracy is 10% typically when reference voltage 
changes from 0.1V to 0.35V. The reference voltage can 
be calculated by Equation 2:

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Current Limit and Hiccup Mode 
Short-Circuit Protection 
The switch current limit avoids high inductor current 
and drawing excessive current from a battery or input 
voltage rail. Excessive current might occur with a heavy 
load or shorted output circuit condition. The SGM61061 
keeps sensing the current of the high-side switch. Once 
the high-side switch current limit is reached, the high-side 
switch is turned off. After keeping for 30μs (TYP), low-side 
current limit circuit is enabled and shield the adaptive 
off-time circuit. The on-time of the low-side switch is 
determined by the inductor, the output voltage and the 
value of the low-side current limit. 
If the current limit persists uninterrupted for more than 
64 cycles, the device stops switching and turns the 
output discharge circuit on. A new soft-start is initiated 
automatically (hiccup) after 1.2ms (TYP). The hiccup 
repeats until the overload or short-circuit fault is 
cleared. 
 
Negative Current Limit 
In PFM mode, the low-side MOSFET will be turned off 
once the low-side current fall to IZCD to maintain high 
efficiency at light load. However in PWM mode, the IZCD 
changed to negative current, which is define as 
negative current limit (ILIM_LN). When the input and 
output conditions are unchanged, if the low-side current 
drops to ILIM_LN, the low-side MOSFET will be turned off 
in advance, then the high-side MOSFET is turned on. 
 
Output Over-Voltage Protection (OVP) 
The device contains an over-voltage protection circuit 
to avoid high overshoots of the output voltage during 
operation. Usually an OVP occurs after removal of an 
overload condition. Upon removal of the overload 
condition, the regulator output rises quickly because 
the high inductor current charges the output capacitor 
rapidly, especially if COUT is small. The error amplifier 
will respond and re-adjust itself but not as fast as the 
output filter (LC) and an overshoot occurs.  
To minimize the overshoots, the device monitors the FB 
pin voltage and compares it to the internal OVP 
threshold. OVP is triggered while the FB voltage rising 
above 115% of reference voltage, and is released while 
the FB voltage falls below typically 110% of reference 
voltage. In PFM mode, the switching stops and 
discharge circuit is turned on at OVP protection. In 
PWM mode, discharge circuit is turned on and 
high-side MOSFET is kept off, low-side MOSFET is 
turned on once every 40μs (TYP). Every time a 
low-side MOSFET is on, it is turned off when the 
current flowing through it reaches the negative current 
limit. When the FB voltage drops below the OVP 
threshold, the discharge circuit and low-side MOSFET 
is turned off and high-side MOSFET can be turned on 
again in the next cycle. 
 
Output Discharge Function 
If the device is in any of the following states: UVLO, 
shutdown by EN, OTP, or OVP, an internal output 
discharge FET is turned on and discharges the output 
through the SW pin smoothly, the resistance of 
discharge FET is about 40.5Ω (TYP). 
 
Thermal Shutdown 
Thermal protection is designed to protect the die 
against 
overheating 
damage. 
If 
the 
junction 
temperature exceeds TJSD threshold, the switching 
stops and the device shuts down. Automatic recovery 
with a soft-start will begin when the junction 
temperature drops below the +130℃ falling threshold.

NOTE: R6 and C4 are recommended when the VCON voltage 
regulator function is used. If the long input power cable is used, or the 
input voltage is on/off by air-break switch, EC1 should be installed. 
 
Input Capacitor Selection (CIN) 
The input capacitor is the low impedance energy 
source for the converter that helps provide stable 
operation. A low ESR multilayer ceramic capacitor is 
recommended for best filtering. In most cases, two 
22μF input capacitors are recommended, a larger value 
reduces input voltage ripple and improve system 
stability. Usually a 0.1μF low ESR ceramic capacitor 
needs to be connected between the VIN and GND pins 
as closely as possible. 
 
Inductor Selection (L) 
The important factors for inductor selection are 
inductance (L), saturation current (ISAT), RMS rating 
(IRMS), DC resistance (DCR) and dimensions. Use 
Equation 3 to find the inductor peak current (IL_MAX) and 
peak-to-peak ripple current (∆IL) in static conditions:

                   (3)
 
IO_MAX is the maximum load current, D = VOUT/VIN represents 
duty cycle and fSW is the switching frequency. 
Typically, the peak-to-peak inductor current is selected 
between 10% and 30% of the maximum output current. 
The inductor of that the saturation current is 20% high 
than IL_MAX is recommended. The inductor initial 
tolerance can be as high as -20% to +20% of the 
nominal value and proper current derating is usually 
required. More generally, choosing the saturation 
current above high-side limit is enough. It should be 
noted that low-side current should avoid falling to 
negative current limit when no load in PWM mode. In 
addition, DC resistance and size should also be taken 
into account when selecting an appropriate inductor. 
Larger inductance values reduce the ripple current but 
lead to sluggish transient response. L1 = 0.47µH is the 
recommended values for the typical application.

APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued) 
Output Capacitor Selection (COUT) 
The architecture of the SGM61061 allows use of tiny 
ceramic-type output capacitors with low equivalent 
series resistance (ESR). These capacitors provide low 
output voltage ripple and are thus recommended. To 
keep the resistance up to high frequencies and to 
achieve narrow capacitance variation with temperature, 
it is recommended to use X7R or X5R dielectric. Bias 
voltage can cause significant capacitance drops in the 
ceramic capacitors. The effective deviation of a ceramic 
capacitor can be as high as -50% to +20% of the 
nominal value. COUT = 2 × 22µF is the recommended 
values for the typical application. 
Output Voltage Setting 
Use Equation 4 to select the R1/R2 resistor divider to 
set the VOUT. The parasitic capacitance of the FB pin 
and R1 form a low-pass filter, which can effectively filter 
out high-frequency interference input from the FB pin. 
However, it also adds a pole to the control loop, and if 
the frequency of this pole is too low, the stability of the 
system will be reduced.

NOTE: The value of C9 needs to match the value of R1 and 
R2. 
 
Load Transient Optimization 
A feed-forward capacitor (C9) reduces the output ripple 
in PSM and improves the load transient response. If it 
is necessary to reduce the drop of output voltage at 
load transient, the response speed of the system can 
be improved by increasing the CFF (C9) capacitance 
value. However, excessive CFF (C9) capacitance will 
reduce the stability of the system, which can be 
compensated by increasing the output capacitance 
value.

Layout Guidelines 
A good printed-circuit-board (PCB) layout is a critical 
element of any high-performance design. Follow the 
guidelines below for designing a good layout for the 
SGM61061. 
• Place the input capacitor close to the device with the 
shortest possible connection traces.  
• Share the same GND return point for the input and 
output capacitors and locate it as close as possible to 
the device GND pin to minimize the AC current loops. 
Place the inductor close to the switching node and 
connect it with a short trace to minimize the parasitic 
capacitances coupled to the SW node. 
• Keep the signal traces like the FB sense line away 
from SW or other noisy sources. 
• Use GND planes in middle layers for shielding and 
minimizing the ground potential drifts. 
Refer to Figure 5 to Figure 6 for a recommended PCB 
layout.
