GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM61310 is a synchronous Buck converter with a 
wide input voltage range of 4V to 36V. This device can 
deliver up to 1A to the output over a wide input voltage. 
It is an easy-to-use device with power switches and 
peak current mode control compensation all integrated 
in a small 6-pin package. A typical 1.8ms soft-start 
ramp is also included to minimize the inrush current. 
This device can be easily used in various industrial 
applications powered from unregulated sources. 
This device employs cycle-by-cycle peak current limit, 
output over-voltage protection and thermal shutdown 
with auto recovery. The current limit is implemented for 
switches to prevent overheating (and thermal shutdown) 
when an output short is detected. Auto recovery after 
over-current, output short, overheating or over-voltage 
fault maintains the system operational with no 
shutdown. 
The SGM61310 operates at 700kHz switching frequency 
to support use of relatively small inductors for an 
optimized solution size. In light load condition, the 
SGM61310A enters in the pulse skip modulation (PSM) 
mode to improve high efficiency, while the SGM61310B 
works in the forced pulse width modulation (FPWM) 
mode to achieve low output ripple. 
The SGM61310 is available in a Green SOT-23-6 
package.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

DETALED DESCRIPTION 
Overview 
The 
SGM61310A 
and 
SGM61310B 
are 
1A 
output 
synchronous Buck regulators with internal compensation and 
peak current mode control. They can operate from an input 
voltage range of 4V to 36V. These devices need a few 
external components and provide an easy and small size 
power supply solution for industrial applications with good 
thermal performance. With 75μA quiescent current and 3μA 
shutdown 
current, 
they 
are 
also 
well 
suited 
for 
battery-powered applications. 
Both devices normally operate at fixed 700kHz frequency. At 
light load condition, the SGM61310A enters PSM mode to 
keep high efficiency. But the SGM61310B maintains FPWM 
mode to keep low output ripple and tight voltage regulation at 
light loads. 
Accurate EN input threshold and internal soft-start time 
(1.8ms) add more design flexibility to these devices. 
Additional features such as thermal shutdown, input 
under-voltage lockout, cycle-by-cycle current limit, and 
short-circuit protection (hiccup mode) are also provided. 
 
Switching Frequency and Current Mode 
Control 
The Functional Block Diagram and basic waveforms of these 
Buck synchronous regulators are shown in Figure 2 and 
Figure 3. The N-MOSFETs are used for high-side (HS) and 
low-side (LS) (synchronous rectifier) switches. The HS duty 
cycle (D = tON/tSW) is controlled in closed loop to regulate and 
maintain the output voltage at a constant level. The switching 
period is tSW= 1/fSW, and the HS on-time is tON. When HS is 
turned on, the SW node voltage sharply rises towards VIN, 
and the inductor current (IL) starts ramping up with (VIN - 
VOUT)/L slope. When HS is turned off, the LS is turned on after 
a very short dead time to avoid shoot-through, and IL ramps 
down with -VOUT/L slope. When the inductor current is 
continuous (either due to sufficient load, or FPWM), the 
output voltage is proportional to the input voltage and duty 
cycle (VOUT = D × VIN) if component parasitics are ignored. 
The output voltage is sensed by a resistor divider through FB 
pin and is regulated by feedback loop. This voltage is 
compared to an accurate reference and the voltage error 
signal is used as set point for an inner current loop that 
adjusts the peak inductor current. The input to the current 
loop is clamped to a fixed level to limit the maximum peak 
current and is compared to the actual peak current, sensed 
by the voltage drop across the HS switch to control the HS 
switch on-time. The loop internal compensation allows easy 
and stable design of the power supply with a few external 
elements for almost any output capacitor arrangement.

Output Voltage Setting 
The output voltage can be stepped down to as low as the 1V 
reference voltage (VREF). An external feedback resistor 
divider along with the internal reference is used to set the 
output voltage (VOUT) as shown in Figure 4. The VREF is 
compared to the VFB voltage and the control loop adjusts the 
duty cycle to null the VREF - VFB.

DETALED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Use 1% or higher quality resistors with low thermal tolerance 
for an accurate and thermally stable output voltage. The 
low-side resistor RFBB is selected based on the desired 
current in the divider. Typically, a 10kΩ to 100kΩ resistor is 
selected for RFBB. Lower RFBB values increase loss and 
reduce light load efficiency. However, improve VOUT accuracy 
in PSM. Large RFBT values (> 1MΩ) are not recommended 
because the feedback path impedance will be too high and 
more noise sensitive. If a large RFBT value is necessary, the 
PCB layout design will be more critical because the feedback 
path must be short and away from noise sources such as SW 
node or inductor body. 
 
EN Input 
The EN pin is an input and must not be left open. The 
simplest way to enable the device is to connect this pin to VIN 
pin via a resistor. This allows for self-startup of the 
SGM61310 when VIN > VUVLO. This pin can also be used to 
turn the device on or off with logic or analog signals. If VEN < 
1.1V (TYP), the device will shut down. Only if VEN > 1.23V 
(TYP) the device will start operation. The system UVLO level 
can be increased accurately with a resistor divider (see 
Figure 5). This feature can be used for power supply 
sequencing which is required for proper power-up of the 
system voltage rails. It can also be used as protection, such 
as preventing supply battery from depletion. Control of the 
enable input by logic signals may also be used for 
sequencing or protection.

Minimum On-Time and Off-Time 
The shortest duration for the high-side switch on-time (tON_MIN) 
is 110ns (TYP). For the off-time (tOFF_MIN), the minimum value is 
80ns (TYP). The duty cycle (or equivalently the VOUT/VIN ratio) 
range in CCM operation is limited by tON_MIN and tOFF_MIN 
depending on the switching frequency. The minimum and 
maximum allowed duty cycles are given by Equations 2 and 3:

Note that the duty cycle has a more limited range at higher

important factor to maximize efficiency and input voltage

Compensation and Feed-Forward 
Capacitor (CFF) 
The SGM61310A/B is internally compensated (see Figure 2) 
and is stable over the entire fSW and VOUT operating range. 
However, the phase margin can be low for some ranges of 
VOUT when low ESR ceramic capacitors are used in the output. 
In such cases, it is recommended to use a feed-forward 
capacitor (CFF) in parallel with the RFBT to improve the 
transient response as shown in Figure 6.

DETALED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
While the zero increases the phase at the crossover 
frequency, the pole helps keeping the required gain margin 
after the crossover frequency. 
If for similar COUT values, other RFBT values are used, adjust 
the CFF such that (CFF × RFBT) is unchanged. CFF must also be 
modified if COUT is changed. For COUT capacitors with lower 
ESR, larger CFF values are needed. For example, with 
electrolytic capacitors (large ESR), the location of ESR zero, 
(Equation 8), is typically low enough for phase boost at 
crossover and CFF is not needed.

Note that CFF increases the feedback of the output ripple and 
the coupled noise to the FB node. A large CFF value can 
deteriorate the VOUT regulation. If significant derating for the 
CFF value at cold operating temperatures is expected, it is 
better to use larger COUT capacitance rather than increasing 
the nominal CFF value. 
 
BOOT (Bootstrap Voltage) 
The gate driver of the high-side N-MOSFET switch requires a 
voltage higher than VIN that is present on its drain. A bootstrap 
voltage regulator is integrated to provide this voltage which is 
powered by bootstrapping through a small ceramic capacitor 
placed between the BOOT and SW pins. CBOOT is charged in 
each cycle when the LS switch is turned on (VSW ≈ 0V) and 
discharges to the boot regulator when the HS switch is turned 
on (VSW ≈ VIN). A 0.1μF ceramic capacitor with 16V or higher 
rated voltage is recommended. 
 
Thermal Shutdown (TSD) 
If the junction temperature exceeds +170 ℃ (TYP), the 
device will shut down. It will recover automatically with a 
normal power-up sequence and soft-start when the 
temperature falls below +150℃ (TYP). 
 
Over-Current Protection and Short-Circuit 
Protection (Hiccup Mode) 
Cycle-by-cycle current limit for both peak and valley currents 
(upper and lower switches peak currents) are included in the 
SGM61310A/B. If the OCP/SCP persists, it will enter hiccup 
mode to avoid thermal shutdown. The HS switch over-current 
protection is natural in peak current mode control. In each 
cycle, the HS current sensing starts a short time (blanking 
time) after it is turned on. The slope compensation ramp is 
deducted from the EA (Error Amplifier) output to avoid 
subharmonic oscillations and the result is compared to the HS 
current to determine the HS turn-off time (on-time). See 
Figure 2 for details. Before comparison, the EA output is 
clamped to a fixed maximum threshold (IHS_LIMIT) to limit the 
current. So, the peak current limit of the high-side switch is 
not affected by the slope compensation and remains constant 
over the full duty cycle range. 
When the LS switch is turned on, the inductor current starts 
falling. The LS current is sensed while it is on and the switch 
will not be turned off at the end of cycle if this current is still 
higher than its limit (ILS_LIMIT) and keeps conducting until the 
current falls below ILS_LIMIT. Hiccup mode is considered to 
protect the device from overheating and damage in severe 
over-current conditions. 
 
Functional Modes 
Shutdown Mode 
The EN input controls the device ON/OFF condition. If VEN < 
1.1V (TYP), the device will shut down. The device will also 
turn off if either VIN falls below its UVLO threshold. 
 
Active Mode 
If VEN is above its precision threshold, and VIN is above its 
UVLO levels, the device will be activated. EN pin can be 
connected to VIN to allow self-startup when VIN voltage is in 
the 4V to 36V operating range. UVLO and EN settings in 
active mode are explained in the previous sections. Four 
operating modes are possible depending on the load current 
(∆IL = inductor peak-to-peak current ripple):  
1. CCM: Fixed frequency continuous conduction mode: both 
SGM61310A and SGM61310B operate in CCM when IOUT > 
∆IL/2. 
2. DCM: Fixed frequency discontinuous conduction mode: 
only for SGM61310A (PSM), the switching frequency does 
not change when IOUT < ∆IL/2. 
3. PSM: Pulse skip modulation mode (SGM61310A only): the 
switching frequency reduces at very light load operation, 
when the EA (Error Amplifier) output falls below VPSM. 
4. FPWM: Forced pulse width modulation mode for 
SGM61310B only: it operates with fixed frequency at light 
load operation. 
Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM) 
In CCM operation, the frequency is fixed and the output 
voltage ripple will be minimal. The maximum output current of 
1A is supplied in CCM operation.

DETALED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Light Load Operation with PSM (SGM61310A) 
If the output current of the SGM61310A falls below ∆IL/2, its 
operating mode changes to DCM (also called diode emulation 
mode or DEM). In DCM, the LS switch is turned off when its 
current reverses direction and drops to IL_ZC (IL_ZC = 20mA 
TYP). Switching and conduction losses in DCM are lower 
than FPWM operation at light load condition, even before 
entering PSM. At light load condition, the device enters PSM 
to keep its high efficiency. PSM mode is activated when the 
EA (Error Amplifier) output falls below VPSM. In PSM, fSW is 
reduced to maintain regulation. With reduced frequency, the 
switching losses are also dropped and efficiency is improved.  
 
Light Load Operation with FPWM (SGM61310B) 
For FPWM option, SGM61310B is locked in PWM mode from 
full load to no load. Negative inductor currents are allowed at 
light load to continue PWM operation. It is a tradeoff that 
sacrifices light load efficiency for lower output ripple, better 
output regulation and keeping witching frequency fixed. To 
avoid fatal negative current in the LS switch, this current is 
limited at IL_NEG (IL_NEG = -630mA TYP).

The external components are designed based on the 
application requirements and device stability. Some suitable 
output filters (L and CO) values are provided in Table 1 to 
simplify component selection. Consider the following notes 
when using this table. 
1. Choose the inductance for VIN = 36V.  
2. CO values in the table are actual derated values. Use 
higher nominal values for ceramic capacitors.  
3. Left RFBB floating to set VOUT = 1V. 
4. If any other RFBT value is designed, resize CFF to keep (CFF 
× RFBT) unchanged if CFF is needed. 
5. If the selected output capacitance has high ESR, the CFF is 
not necessary for extra phase boost.

where VREF = 1V is the internal reference. For example, by 
choosing RFBB = 25.5kΩ, the RFBT value for 5V output will be 
calculated as 102kΩ. 
 
Switching Frequency 
The SGM61310A/B switching frequency is 700kHz (TYP). It 
may also drop due to frequency foldback when the duty cycle 
reaches its maximum or due to PSM operation. 
 
Inductor 
Three main inductor parameters that need to be designed are 
inductance, saturation current and rated current. The DCR is 
also an important factor for efficiency. Physical dimensions, 
form factor and shielded or non-shielded structure are other 
important factors that are selected based on the application. 
The inductance is designed by selecting the peak-to-peak 
current ripple (ΔIL) that is given by Equation 10. ΔIL is 
increased at higher input voltages, so VIN_MAX is used in the 
equation. The minimum required inductance (LMIN) is 
calculated from Equation 11. KIND represents the ratio of 
inductor ripple current to the maximum output current (KIND 
=ΔIL/IOUT_MAX). It is typically chosen between 20% to 40%.

APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued)
During a short or over-current, either RMS or peak inductor 
current can increase significantly. The inductor rated RMS 
and saturation current ratings should be higher than those 
peaks respectively. It is generally desired to choose a smaller 
inductance value to have faster transient response, smaller 
size, and lower DCR. However, reducing the inductance 
increases the current ripple that may result in over-current 
detection and triggering OCP before reaching full load current. 
Moreover, higher current ripple increases core, conduction, 
and capacitor losses. Output voltage ripple will also be higher 
with the same output capacitance. In general, choosing a too 
small inductance is not recommended for peak current mode 
control. On the other hand, too large inductance is also not 
recommended, because the reduced current ripple degrades 
the comparator signal to noise ratio. Selecting KIND = 0.4 
results in LMIN = 15.3µH. A 15μH ferrite inductor with 2.1A 
RMS rating and 2.5A saturation current is selected as the 
closest standard value.  
 
Output Capacitor 
The main factors for designing COUT are output voltage ripple, 
control loop stability and the magnitude of output voltage 
overshoot/undershoot after a load transients. 
The output voltage ripple has two main components. One is 
due to the AC current (ΔIL) going through the capacitor ESR:

    (13) 
These AC components are not in phase and the total 
peak-to-peak ripple is less than ∆VOUT_ESR + ∆VOUT_C.  
In many applications, tight regulation in response to large and 
fast load transients is required. This can be a more severe 
condition on designing COUT value. Typically the control loop 
recovers the output voltage after four or five cycles and COUT 
should be large enough to provide the difference between 
current received from inductor and the current delivered to the 
load during this period. The minimum capacitance needed to 
limit the undershoot to VUS when the load steps up from IOL to 
IOH is given in Equation 14. Similarly, when the load steps 
from IOH down to IOL, COUT should be large enough to absorb 
the extra energy coming from the inductor without a large 
voltage overshoot (VOS) as calculated in Equation 15:

In this example, maximum acceptable ripple is 50mV. 
Assuming ΔVOUT_ESR = ΔVOUT_C = 50mV and KIND = 0.4. 
Equation 12 results in ESR < 125mΩ and Equation 13 leads 
to COUT > 2.86μF. If the overshoot/undershoot transient 
requirement is 5% then VUS = VOS = 5% × VOUT = 250mV. 
Equation 14 and 15, lead to COUT > 22.86μF and COUT > 
5.85μF respectively. Now considering all conditions and 
including voltage derating of the ceramic capacitors, COUT is 
composed of a 22μF/16V ceramic capacitor parallel with a 
1μF/16V ceramic capacitor. 
 
Designing Feed-Forward Capacitor 
Even though the SGM61310A/B is internally compensated, 
with low ESR ceramic capacitors, the phase margin can be 
low depending on the VOUT and fSW values. By adding an 
external feed-forward capacitor (CFF) in parallel with the RFBT, 
the phase margin can be improved (phase boost around 
crossover frequency). Without CFF, and if ESR is very small, 
the crossover frequency (fX) can be estimated from Equation 
16, in which COUT is the actual derated value:

             (17) 
For slightly larger ESR values, choose a CFF value that is less 
than that estimated by Equation 17. For larger ESR values, 
CFF is not needed. 
 
Input Capacitor 
High frequency decoupling on the input supply pins is 
necessary for the device. A bulk capacitor may also be 
needed in some applications. Typically, 4.7μF to 10μF high 
quality ceramic capacitor (X5R, X7R or better) with voltage 
rating twice the maximum input voltage is recommended for 
decoupling capacitor. If the source is away from the device (> 
5cm), some bulk capacitance is also needed to damp the 
voltage spikes caused by the wiring or PCB trace parasitic 
inductances. In this example, 4.7μF/50V/X7R capacitors and 
a 0.1μF ceramic capacitor placed right beside the device VIN 
and GND pins for very high-frequency filtering are used. 
 
Bootstrap Capacitor 
A 0.1μF/16V/X5R or X7R ceramic capacitor is recommended 
for CBOOT.

VIN UVLO Adjustment 
The system UVLO threshold can be increased using two 
external resistors RENT and RENB (see Figure 5) to form a 
voltage divider between VIN and EN pins. The UVLO 
comparator provides a rising threshold (power-up) and a 
falling threshold (power-down) for VIN. Use Equation 18 to set

RENT = 387kΩ and a UVLO falling threshold of 5.36V. 
 
Layout 
Consider the following layout design guidelines for a 
high-quality power supply with good thermal and EMI 
performances.  
1. Place CINx as close as possible to the VIN and PGND pins. 
CINx and COx return should be close together and connected 
on the top layer PGND pin/plane and pad.  
2. Minimize FB trace length and keep both feedback resistors 
close to the FB pin. Bring the VOUT sense trace from the point 
where VOUT accuracy is important and keep it away from the 
noisy nodes (SW), preferably through another layer that is on 
the other side of a shield layer. Place CFF close to RFBT.  
3. Use one of the mid-layers as ground plane for noise 
shielding and extra path for heat dissipation.  
4. Connect the ground layer to only one ground point on the 
top layer. The feedback and enable circuit returns must be 
routed separately through the ground plane to avoid large 
load currents or high di/dt switching currents to flow in these 
sensitive analog ground traces. Bad grounding results in poor 
regulation and erratic output ripple. 
5. Choose wide traces for VIN, VOUT and ground to minimize 
voltage drops and maximize efficiency. 
6. Use an array of thermal vias (e.g., 6 filled vias) under the 
exposed pad and connect them to the ground planes on 
mid-layers and the bottom layer. Maximize the heat sinking 
copper areas and solidify them with metal coatings such that 
the die temperature remains below +125℃ in all operating 
conditions.
