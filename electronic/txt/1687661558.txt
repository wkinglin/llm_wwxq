GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM446 is a 2-terminal temperature sensor with 
an output current proportional to absolute temperature. 
It can be considered as a constant-current and 
high-impedance regulator passing 1μA/K in the supply 
voltage range from 4V to 35V. The SGM446 is 
calibrated to 298.2μA output current at 298.2K (+25℃). 
Compared with the traditional electrical temperature 
sensor, the SGM446 does not need resistance 
measurement circuit, linearization circuit, precision 
voltage amplifier and cold junction compensation. It 
also integrates the compensation of temperature, flow 
rate measurement, discrete-component correlation, 
biasing proportional to absolute temperature, level 
detection of fluids and anemometry. 
The high-impedance current output of the SGM446 
makes the device insensitive to voltage drops 
especially on long lines. Therefore, it is particularly 
suitable for remote sensing applications. The multiplex 
of the SGM446 is achieved by switching the current 
through a CMOS multiplexer or switching the supply 
voltage through the logic gate. 
The SGM446 is available in Green UTDFN-2×2-2L and 
UTDFN-2×2-4L packages. It is specified over a wide 
temperature range of -55℃ to +150℃.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
The SGM446 can transfer the temperature to the 
current directly. The silicon transistors are used to 
operate the transducer through a linear characteristic 
between output current and temperature. If the collector 
current density (r) of two transistors is constant, the 
base-emitter voltage can be calculated by (kT/q) × Inr, 
where k illustrates Boltzmann constant and q illustrates 
the quantity of electric charge for one electron. As a 
result, r, k and q are constant and the only variable in 
the above equation is temperature T. Therefore, the 
characteristic is called proportional to absolute 
temperature (PTAT). 
The thin-film with low temperature coefficient plays an 
important role in converting PTAT voltage to the related 
PTAT current. Moreover, the scale between PTAT and 
total current is constant. The internal structure of 
SGM446 transducer is shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2. Internal Structure 
The corresponding PTAT current can also be calculated 
and converted with two resistors R5 and R6 in Figure 2. 
Because of the basic of current mirror theory, Q11 is 
used to copy the collector current of Q10 and Q12, which 
is the most important transistor as it can provide bias 
and leakage current for the rest of the system, so that 
the total current can be PTAT with the exist of Q11. R5 
and R6 can be used to calibrate the transducer at the 
degree of +25℃, 
and the structure of them is trimmed. 
 
The Explanation of Temperature Sensing 
The SGM446 can be easily used in a wide range of 
applications. Both the environment of temperature and 
the level of supply voltage can influence the accuracy 
of the transducer. 
The characteristic of SGM446 is PTAT. Because the 
relationship between Celsius and Kelvin scale is T (℃) 
= T (K) - 273.2, the absolute 0 degree in Kelvin scale is 
equal to -273.2 in Celsius scale. This means that the 
output current of the transducer is equal to the Kelvin 
temperature multiplied by the scale factor (1μA/K). With 
this 
specification, 
the 
output 
current 
can 
be 
automatically adjusted with the temperature change, 
which means that the output current is equal to 298μA 
at the temperature level of +25℃ (298K). 
 
Calibration Error 
The error of calibration is always set by the factory. It is 
defined 
as 
the 
difference 
between 
the 
actual 
temperature and the indicated temperature. The 
calibration error is also PTAT. For instance, the 
maximum calibration error can change from +1.6℃ at 
-55℃ to -2℃ at +150℃. Figure 3 illustrates the 
change of calibration error within the specified 
temperature range.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (Continued) 
The calibration error is a significant part within the total 
error of the device, but it is easy to trim. Figure 4 shows 
the method about how to trim this calibration error.

Figure 4. Trim of Temperature 
In Figure 4, the temperature can be measured and 
calculated by the adjustable resistors and the 
temperature sensor. The principle of this measurement 
is that if it is trimmed at only one temperature, the 
calibration error can be zero within the whole 
temperature range, and the PTAT current can be 
transferred to voltage with 1mV/K scale factor. Also, 
this is called an I-V resistor (or a reference of ADC for 
current input case) which can be trimmed for 
minimizing the calibration error. 
 
Error vs. Temperature: Trimming out the 
Calibration Error 
The calibration error is tested for each SGM446 when 
trimming out. From Figure 5, the calibration error of the 
transducer is also PTAT. In addition, from the figure 
below, there are curvature and the error of slope at the 
extreme of temperature. The effect of trimming is 
shown as below.

Error vs. Temperature: No Trimming 
When measuring the temperature or output current of 
the SGM446, the total error consists of the calibration 
error and the variance of PTAT current. For example, if 
there is no trimming, the total error can be increased to 
+1.6℃ at -55℃. 
 
Nonlinearity 
The nonlinearity of SGM446 is defined as the maximum 
offset between the current curve within the specified 
temperature and its fitted straight line. In addition, the 
SGM446 has nonlinearity characteristic in its specified 
temperature range from -55℃ to +150℃. Figure 6 
shows the typical values of temperature error for Figure

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (Continued) 
The total temperature error of the following circuit as 
shown in Figure 7 is contributed by the nonlinearity of 
the transducer. R1 can be adjusted to change the 
output of the circuit to 0V at 0℃, and R2 can be 
adjusted to change the output of the circuit to 10V at 
+100℃. This method can also adjust the output of the 
circuit accordingly with different temperatures. If the 
circuit is designed to measure the temperature of +150℃ 
(15V), the V+ voltage of the amplifier should be greater 
than 16V. Moreover, the V- voltage should be less than 
or equal to -4V to guarantee the flow of PTAT current.

Voltage and Thermal Environment Effects 
The Power Supply Rejection (PSR) illustrates the 
maximum change of output current with the variations 
of input voltage. Under the case of non-ideal power 
supply, an insensitive output is necessary for the 
temperature accuracy. This transducer can also be 
series with a hundreds-ohm resistor (such as the 
multiplexer made by CMOS). 
If the power supply voltage is greater than or equal to 
5V, the property of PTAT will not be changed. That is, 
the error or change can be regarded as a calibration 
error and be easily trimmed by the scale factor (see 
Figure 5). 
The SGM446 should be used in a low thermal 
resistance condition with 5V power supply. Any large 
variations or changes of the thermal resistors would 
cause self-heating. And the transducer may not work 
accurately and properly under this environment.

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
The SGM446 can be used in the condition of remote 
sensing of temperature. Figure 9 shows the principle of 
thermometer, which illustrates that the output current of 
the transducer can be converted to voltage (1mV/K) by 
a 1kΩ resistor. If the Celsius degree is required for 
reading, the output should be offset by 273.2mV as 
SGM446 only measures the degree in Kelvin.

The following circuit shown in Figure 11 can convert the 
difference between two PTAT currents into voltages, 
which can measure the temperature difference. The 
resistors R1 and R2 can trim the output value of the 
circuit. That is, these two resistors can trim the offset of 
inherent between two transducers. It will also cause a 
differential temperature rise due to the internal 
dissipation if the value of V+ and V- are different. And 
the application of this circuit can be used in 
anemometry.

Figure 12 can be used to compensate the cold junction

used as a reference for the thermocouple (TC) at a 
temperature range from +15℃ to +35℃. The resistor 
RT can calibrate the circuit for the meter of the circuit 
with known reference temperature. For the Celsius 
temperature from +15℃ to +35℃, the accuracy can be 
compensated within the range of ±2℃ if using the 
specified components with TCs. And different resistor 
values can fit different types of TCs. If the users attempt 
to decrease the error, the resistors and voltage 
reference in TCs should be taken into consideration.

APPLICATION INFORMATION (Continued) 
The current transmitter which is shown in Figure 13 is 
suitable for using in the system with 40V and 1kΩ. This 
circuit can be used in the narrow-span temperatures 
within the output current range from 4mA to 20mA. In 
this application, the output of SGM446 is amplified from 
1μA/K to 1mA/℃, which means that 4mA and 12mA 
correspond to +17℃ and +25℃ respectively. The 
adjustable resistor RT can be used to trim the circuit to 
a feasible output, so that it can change the measured 
temperature range which is lower than the current 
limitation.

In Figure 14, the structure of reverse blocking allows 
the SGM446 to be powered by a CMOS with a voltage 
level of 5V. This circuit can prevent the heat from 
dissipation through multiplexing and switching. The 
transducer can transmit current if it is connected to a 
logic-high COMS, while there is no current for the 
transducer connected to a logic-low CMOS. The 
parasitic capacitance from the SGM446 should be also 
taken into account.

an 8-channel multiplexer in the 2-trim mode (see Figure 
7 and Figure 8). The additional SGM446s can also be 
multiplexed with their corresponding resistors with the 
accuracy of ±2℃ for -55℃ to +125℃.If the circuit is 
used to test the temperature of +150℃, the supply 
voltage of the amplifier should be increased to +20℃ 
to obtain a higher output voltage.
