DECEMBER 2023 – REV. A. 2 
GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The 
high-speed, 
single-channel 
low-side 
driver 
SGM48521Q is designed to drive GaN FETs and logic 
level MOSFETs. Application areas include LiDAR, time 
of flight, facial recognition, and power converters using 
low-side drivers. The SGM48521Q provides 7A source 
and 6A sink output current capability. Split output 
configuration allows individual turn-on and turn-off time 
optimization depending on FET. Package and pinout 
with minimum parasitic inductances reduce the rise and 
fall time and limit the ringing. Additionally, the 2.2ns 
propagation delay with minimized tolerances and 
variations allows efficient operation at high frequencies. 
The driver has internal under-voltage lockout and 
over-temperature protection against overload and fault 
events. 
This device is AEC-Q100 qualified (Automotive 
Electronics Council (AEC) standard Q100 Grade 1) and 
it is suitable for automotive applications. 
The SGM48521Q is available in Green WLCSP-0.88× 
1.28-6B and TDFN-2×2-6DL packages.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.
