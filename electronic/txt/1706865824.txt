OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

It is active low. 
7 
GPIO0/nALARMIN 
I/O 
General Purpose Digital Input/Output Pin0 (default). It is a bidirectional pin which 
has an internal 60kΩ resistor pulled up to IOVDD. This pin can be alternatively 
configured as nALARMIN input pin, which is an active low input signal. This pin can 
be floated if it is not used. 
8 
GPIO1/nALARMOUT 
I/O 
General Purpose Digital Input/Output Pin1 (default). It is a bidirectional pin which 
has an internal 60kΩ resistor pulled up to IOVDD. This pin can be alternatively 
configured as nALARMOUT output pin, which is an open-drain output. If there is an 
alarm event is generated, it outputs low. This pin can be floated if it is not used. 
9 
GPIO2/nADCTRIG 
I/O 
General Purpose Digital Input/Output Pin2 (default). It is a bidirectional pin which 
has an internal 60kΩ resistor pulled up to IOVDD. This pin can be alternatively 
configured as nADCTRIG input pin, which is an active low input signal. The falling 
edge of nADCTRIG starts ADC sampling and conversion. This pin can be floated if 
it is not used.

FUNCTION 
48 
AGND2 
I 
Analog Ground. This pin is the ground of the analog circuits of the chip. AGND1, 
AGND2 and AGND3 must be connected to same reference point (AGND). 
49 
REF_CMP 
O 
Internal Reference Decoupling Pin. Connect it with a 4.7μF capacitor to AGND2 pin. 
Be noted that it will take about 5ms for the REF_CMP voltage fully settling after the 
ADC_REF_BUFF bit (which is D[4] in ADC configuration register) is enabled from a 
previous disabled status and at same time at least one ADC channel is selected in 
ADC MUX configuration registers (which is set by registers 0x13 to 0x15). Before the 
REF_CMP voltage fully settles, any ADC conversion result is untrusted, and any 
ADC conversion operation is not recommended. The REF_CMP voltage settling time 
depends on the decoupling capacitor. The REF_CMP voltage settling time is a 
setting time when the internal reference source charges to the external decoupling 
capacitor. The REF_CMP voltage does not need a settling time when the 
ADC_REF_BUFF bit is enabled from a previous enabled status and any ADC 
channels that are selected by ADC MUX configuration registers are re-configured. 
For all the upping explanations, assume that the internal reference is already enabled 
by setting PREF bit (which is configured in register 0xB4). 
50

voltage. When one of the DACs works in a negative range, the others must also be 
in a negative range.

I 
Analog Ground. This pin is the ground of the analog circuits of the chip. AGND1, 
AGND2 and AGND3 must be connected to same reference point (AGND). 
57 
AVCC_CD 
I 
This pin is the positive analog power of DAC group C and group D. Care should be 
taken that AVCC_AB and AVCC_CD must have the same voltage potential 
(AVCC). 
58 
DAC_D12 
O 
DAC Group D. All DACs in group D have the same output range and clamp 
voltage. When one of the DACs works in a negative range, the others must also be 
in a negative range.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
The SGM90516 is a high integrated analog front end 
which is specified for power amplifier monitoring 
system in communication application. The SGM90516 
consists of the following components, 16-channel 12-bit 
DACs, 16-channel bipolar high voltage inputs and 
5-channel unipolar low voltage inputs and one on-chip 
temperature sensor, and these analog inputs share one 
12-bit ADC core through multiplexer, on-chip 2.5V 
reference. 
The SGM90516 supports 4-wire SPI interface. The 
interface is powered from 1.8V to 5.25V. 
Digital-to-Analog Converters (DACs) 
The SGM90516 has 16-channel 12 bits DACs which 
are operated with on-chip internal reference. Each DAC 
has separate string DAC network and output buffer. 
DAC Output Range and Clamp Configuration 
The SGM90516 has 4 groups of DAC outputs. Each 
DAC group has separate output range and clamp 
voltage. These settings can be re-configured in 
registers by software. After system power on or a reset, 
all DAC setting registers and data registers are reset to 
default values. The internal auto-range detector circuits 
will detect the value of the power supply of the AVSS, 
and compare with AVSSTH threshold, then set the DAC 
outputs range and clamp DAC outputs to the 
corresponding AVSS value automatically. 
Auto-Range Detection 
After system power on or a reset event, the internal 
auto-range detector circuits will detect the value of the 
power supply of the AVSS, and compare with AVSSTH 
threshold. If VAVSS is lower than VAVSSTH, the DACs 
output range will be set between -10V and 0V. If VAVSS 
is higher than VAVSSTH, the DACs output range will be 
set between 0V and 5V. At the same time, the DAC 
outputs will be clamped to the corresponding AVSS 
value automatically. The output range auto detected 
result is stored in general status register (REG0x72). 
Besides of a system power on or a reset event, the 
auto-range detector can also be triggered by a writing 
operation to the power-down 0 and power-down 1 
registers (REG0xB2 and REG0xB3), or a writing 
operation 
to 
the 
device 
configuration 
register 
(REG0x02). 
The output range of each DAC group can be 
re-configured by software through the DAC range 0 and 
DAC range 1 registers (REG0x1E and REG0x1F). The 
available voltage ranges are -10V to 0V, -5V to 0V, 0V 
to 5V, and 0V to 10V. 
NOTES: 
The recommended connections of AVSS are: 
1. If output range is positive, connect it to AGND, and 
then the clamp voltage is 0V. 
2. If the output range is negative, connect it to the 
negative power supply rail, and then the clamp voltage 
depends on the negative power supply rail.

DAC Register Structure 
The DAC operation data format is straight binary. See 
Table 2 for details. 
DAC has two sets of registers, DAC buffer registers 
and DAC active registers. The data from the host 
controller is firstly written to and stored in DAC buffer 
registers. And then issuing an update command to the 
update register (REG0x0F), the DAC active registers 
are updated and DAC outputs change to new voltage 
accordingly. 
Both DAC buffer registers and DAC active registers can 
be read by host controllers. The readback selection is 
set by the READBACK bit in the configuration register 
(REG0x01[5]).

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
DAC Clear Operation 
Each DAC can go into a clear state that can be 
triggered by hardware and software. Once a DAC is in 
clear state, it outputs a zero-code voltage that is in 
accordance with the configured operating range. In 
clear state, DAC buffer and active registers will hold the 
data before a clear event is informed. Moreover, 
reading back a DAC active register returns zero-code, 
while reading back a buffer register returns to the same 
values as before. 
When the chip is in clear state, the DAC buffer register 
and active register can be updated by writing operation. 
Once the DAC exits the clear state, the DAC output is 
updated with setting. 
The DAC clear registers (REG0xB0 and REG0xB1) are 
used to configure clearing operation to each DAC 
separately. The DACs can go into clear state by many 
alarm events such as a special nALARMIN-controlled 
clear mechanism. To enable this function, the alarm 
event must be set as DAC clear sources in the DAC 
clear source registers (REG0x1A and REG0x1B). And 
it must be specified which DACs are going to be 
cleared in the DAC clear enable registers (REG0x18 
and REG0x19). See details in the programmable 
out-of-range alarms section. 
If an alarm event happens, the corresponding bit is set 
in the alarm status registers, and all the corresponding 
DACs enter a clear state. Once the alarm bit is cleared 
and there are no other alarm events triggered, the DAC 
exits clear state and updates output by DAC active 
register. 
Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) 
The SGM90516 has a 12-bit SAR ADC, which can be 
configured with 21-channel inputs and an internal 
analog temperature sensor through a multiplexer. The 
ADC is driven by internal oscillator. 
The ADC works with an internal 2.5V reference and the 
input range is from 0V to 2 × VREF. The high voltage 
bipolar inputs are scaled into this range by a resistor 
network. 
Analog Inputs 
The ADC input equivalent circuit for the external 
analog-input pins is shown in Figure 5. All switches are 
open when the ADC is in the IDLE state. 
To get the specified performance, an external driving 
amplifier is recommended before each ADC input.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Bipolar Analog Inputs 
The SGM90516 supports 16-channel high voltage 
bipolar inputs. The available input range is between 
-12.5V and 12.5V. The input voltage scales ADC input 
range (which is 0V to 5V) through a 120kΩ resistor 
network. 
The input voltage is given by Equation 1.

ADC Sequencing 
The SGM90516 ADC has two conversion modes, direct 
mode and auto mode (ADC configuration register 
REG0x10). After reset, the direct mode is set by default. 
In both modes, the ADC channels are selected by ADC 
MUX configuration 0/1/2 registers (REG0x13 to 
REG0x15). 
In direct mode, if an ADC trigger signal (software or 
hardware) is issued, all selected channels are 
converted in sequence, and then ADC goes to IDLE 
state. The ADC remains in IDLE state until a new 
trigger signal is issued. 
In auto mode, the conversion cycle is triggered by an 
ADC trigger signal (software or hardware). All selected 
channels will be converted in sequence. When a cycle 
is completed, a new cycle will be started automatically. 
It will not stop until a second trigger signal occurs. 
In both operating modes, the ADC associated registers 
which include ADC configuration register (REG0x10), 
false alarm configuration register (REG0x11), ADC

register 
(REG0x13 
to 
REG0x15), threshold registers (REG0x80 to REG0x97), 
and hysteresis registers (REG0xA0 to REG0xA5) must 
be updated in ADC IDLE state. After any register is 
updated, the host controller must wait at least 2μs 
before sending a new ADC trigger signal. 
ADC Synchronization 
The ADC trigger signal can be set by software (ICONV 
bit in the ADC trigger register, REG0xC0[0]) or 
hardware (GPIO2/nADCTRIG pin). To use nADCTRIG, 
it is necessary to configure in GPIO configuration 
register accordingly (REG0x12). Once the pin is 
configured, a trigger signal is active on the falling edge 
of GPIO2/nADCTRIG pin. 
In auto mode, to update the ADC data registers, there 
is no need for synchronization between the SGM90516 
and the host controller. Only issuing an ADC_UPDATE 
command (in the register update register, REG0x0F), 
all ADC data registers are updated with the latest 
available data. The ADC_UPDATE bit will reset 
automatically. To read all ADC data out, the register 
reading sequence needs to be followed. 
In direct mode, the ADC data registers and temperature 
data register should be read out when the ADC is in 
IDLE state. The ADC provides an indicator signal to 
report ADC status. The indicator signal can be set by 
hardware (GPIO3/nDAV pin which must be configured 
in GPIO configuration register, REG0x12) or software 
(DAVF bit in the general status register, REG0x72[0]). 
Failure to meet the synchronization requirements may 
result in data read faults.

Programmable Out-of-Range Alarms 
The SGM90516 can continuously monitor kinds of 
inputs and give out alarms. The alarm sources include 
the ADC high and low limit, the temperature high and 
low limit, reference voltage and an external input signal 
(nALARMIN alarm). 
If any limit is exceeded (configured in corresponding 
threshold registers, REG0x80 to REG0x97), the 
corresponding bit is set in the alarm status 0/1 registers 
(REG0x70 and REG0x71). Simultaneously the GALR 
bit in the general status register (REG0x72[1]) is set. A 
simple schematic is shown in Figure 7.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Except that the nALARMIN alarm is always unlatched, 
all the others can be latched or dis-latched by setting 
the ALARM_LATCH_DIS bit in ALARMOUT source 1 
register (REG0x1D[4]). Once the ALARM_LATCH_DIS 
bit is enabled, the alarm bits in the alarm status 
registers can be cleared by software (reading the alarm 
status registers). If the exceeding alarm limit condition 
is still fulfilled, the alarm bit will be set again. 
When the ALARM_LATCH_DIS is not enabled, the 
alarm bits are not latched. Once the exceeding alarm 
limit condition is unfulfilled, the alarm bits will be 
cleared automatically. 
All the alarm sources can be used to drive the 
nALARMOUT pin. The nALARMOUT pin function is 
configured 
in 
the 
GPIO 
configuration 
register 
(REG0x12). Any alarm event used to activate the 
nALARMOUT pin must be enabled in the ALARMOUT 
source registers (REG0x1C and REG0x1D). Even if an 
alarm source is not enabled in the ALARMOUT source 
registers and an out-of-limit occurs, the status register 
corresponding bit is still set. 
Out-of-Range Alarms of Unipolar Inputs 
The SGM90516 has 5 unipolar ADC inputs. Each ADC 
input has an out-of-range detection function. If an 
out-of-range event occurs, the corresponding alarm bit 
in the alarm status 0 register (REG0x70) is set to ‘1’. 
The ADC upper threshold registers and the ADC lower 
threshold registers (REG0x80 to REG0x93) define the 
upper and lower limitation of the ADC inputs. 
 
Figure 8. Unipolar Input Out-of-Range Alarms 
 
Out-of-Range Alarms of Local Temperature Sensor 
The SGM90516 has an internal temperature sensor 
out-of-range detection block. The LT upper threshold 
register and the LT lower threshold register (REG0x94 
to REG0x97) set the upper limitation and the lower 
limitation separately. If the temperature exceeds the 
limitations, a high temperature alarm (LT_HIGH_ALR 
bit) or a low temperature alarm (LT_LOW_ALR bit) in 
the alarm status 1 register (REG0x71) is set 
accordingly. 
Besides the programmable threshold temperature 
alarm function, the temperature sensor detection block 
also features a die thermal-alarm function. If the die 
temperature exceeds +150℃, the die thermal alarm 
flag (THERM_ALR bit) is set to ‘1’. 
To enable the internal temperature sensor monitoring 
function, the TEMP_CH bit must be set in ADC MUX 
Configuration 2 Register (REG0x15). 
 
Figure 9. Internal Temperature Out-of-Range Alarms 
 
nALARMIN Alarm 
The SGM90516 supports external alarm signal input, 
which needs to configure nALARMIN pin in GPIO 
configuration register (REG0x12). Once it is configured 
as nALARMIN input, this pin input is active low.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Hysteresis 
The ADC out-of-range detection block and internal 
temperature sensor out-of-range detection block can 
be functioned with a hysteresis window feature. The 
ADC and temperature hysteresis windows are set by 
the ADCn hysteresis registers (REG0xA0 to REG0xA4) 
and LT hysteresis register (REG0xA5). 
The LT hysteresis is programmed between 0 LSB and 
32 LSB for the unipolar inputs alarms. The available 
range for the internal temperature-sensor alarms 
hysteresis is 0℃ to 8℃ with 0.25℃ resolution. The 
die thermal alarm hysteresis is fixed at 8℃. 
False-Alarm Protection 
Ensure that a false is triggered by a true alarm event, 
not by a random wrong action. A false alarm factor N 
can be used to monitor the times of consecutive 
conversions of input signals which are out of normal 
range. If the out-of-range time is equal to or greater 
than N, then an alarm event is issued. The false alarm 
factor N is available for the unipolar inputs and local 
temperature sensor. It can be configured in the false 
alarm configuration register (REG0x11). 
Internal Temperature Sensor 
The SGM90516 has an internal on-chip temperature 
sensor which is used to monitor the chip die 
temperature. The available detecting range is -40℃ to 
+125℃. 
The temperature sensor output can be sampled by 
ADC in a lower sampling speed than the other analog 
input channels. ADC can be in auto mode or direct 
mode. The temperature sensor input is configured in 
ADC MUX configuration 2 register (REG0x15). 
The temperature sensor features 0.25℃ resolution in 
the operating temperature range. The temperature date 
is 12-bit two’s complement format.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Internal Reference 
The SGM90516 has an on-chip 2.5V reference which 
can be used for ADC and DACs. A 4.7μF decoupling 
capacitor is needed between the REF_CMP and the 
AGND2 pins. 
The internal output buffer for the reference is OFF by 
default. It can be enabled in ADC configuration register 
(REG0x10). This buffer is not intended to drive any 
external circuitry. 
The internal reference typically takes about 5ms to fully 
settle at 25℃. This set-up time varies across temperature. 
Thus, temperature conditions shall be considered 
during system level design. 
 
 
Figure 11. Internal Reference Settling Time vs. Temperature 
 
General Purpose I/Os 
The SGM90516 has eight GPIO pins. Each pin has an 
internal 60kΩ pull-up resistor to the IOVDD. The 
GPIO[0:3] pins are multi-function pins, which can be set 
as GPIO pins or interrupt signals (configuration register 
is REG0x12). The GPIO[4:7] pins are dedicated 
GPIOs. 
If any of the GPIOs is used as an output, the setting of 
the corresponding GPIO bit in the GPIO register 
(REG0x7A) determines the output logic state. If the 
GPIO is set as an input, the corresponding bit in the 
GPIO register must be set to ‘1’, and the input value is 
acquired by reading the corresponding bit in the GPIO 
register. 
After a power on or any reset event, all GPIO bits are 
reset to ‘1’, and the GPIOs each are connected to 
IOVDD by a 60kΩ pull-up resistor by default. If unused, 
GPIO pins can be left open.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Device Functional Modes 
The DACs of SGM90516 are divided into four groups. 
Each group has separate output range and clamp 
voltage. These DAC groups can work in the following 
three modes: 
• All-positive DAC range mode 
• All-negative DAC range mode 
• Mixed DAC range mode 
 
All-Positive DAC Range Mode 
In all positive modes, all four DAC groups are set to 
positive 0V to 5V range or 0V to 10V range. The 
outputs of all DACs are limited below AVCC voltage 
(AVCC = AVCC_AB = AVCC_CD). In this mode, if one 
of four DAC groups operates with 0V to 10V voltage 
range, the AVCC must be powered with 10V. Only all 
four DAC groups are set to 0V to 5V range, AVCC 
voltage can be set to 5V. 
The output voltages of all DAC groups must be higher 
than the reference voltage of AVSS pins (AVSSA, 
AVSSB, AVSSC, and AVSSD). In this mode, all 
reference pins are tied together and connected to 
AGND. 
After power on or a reset event, the internal auto-range 
detector circuits will detect the value of the power 
supply of the AVSS, and compare with AVSSTH 
threshold, then set the DAC outputs range and clamp 
DAC outputs to the corresponding AVSS value 
automatically. In all-positive DAC range mode, all DAC 
groups will be reset to default 0V to 5V range. Each 
DAC group output range can be re-configured by 
software in DAC range registers (REG0x1E and 
REG0x1F). 
As in all-positive DAC range mode, the AVSS pins are 
tied to 0V, and the clamp voltage is 0V. Changing the 
DAC output range does not change the clamp voltage.

All-Negative DAC Range Mode 
In all negative modes, all four DAC groups are set to 
negative -5V to 0V range or -10V to 0V range. The 
minimum DAC output voltage of each group must be 
higher than the voltage of the corresponding AVSS 
(AVSSA, AVSSB, AVSSC and AVSSD). It is not 
necessary for all AVSS pins to share same voltage 
potential. Each AVSS pin can be set to its desired 
operating range. 
In all negative modes, all DAC outputs voltage is lower 
than 0V. The AVCC voltage (AVCC, AVCC_AB, 
AVCC_CD) still must be compatible with the device 
operating voltage range of 4.7V to 5V. A suggested 
operating condition can be that AVCC, AVDD and 
DVDD share a common supply potential. 
After power on or a reset event, the internal auto-range 
detector circuits will detect the value of the power 
supply of the AVSS, and compare with AVSSTH 
threshold, then set the DAC outputs range and clamp 
DAC outputs to the corresponding AVSS value 
automatically. In all-negative range mode, all voltages 
of AVSS pins must be lower than VAVSSTH. In this 
condition, all four DAC groups are reset to -10V to 0V 
range in default. Each DAC group output range can be 
re-configured by software in DAC range registers 
(REG0x1E and REG0x1F).

Mixed DAC Range Mode 
In the mixed range mode, each DAC group output 
range can be a positive range (0V to 5V or 0V to 10V) 
or a negative range (-5V to 0V or -10V to 0V). 
All DACs output is limited below AVCC voltage (AVCC 
= AVCC_AB = AVCC_CD). If one DAC group is in the 
0V to 10V range, the others DAC groups supply voltage 
must be greater than or equal to 10V. If all DAC groups 
work in 0V to 5V range, the AVCC voltage can be 5V. 
The minimum DAC output voltage of each group must 
be higher than the voltage of the corresponding AVSS 
(AVSSA, AVSSB, AVSSC and AVSSD). The AVSS pin 
of each is not necessary to be connected to the same 
voltage potential. It can be tied to the desired DAC 
operating negative supply rail. 
After power on or a reset event, the internal auto-range 
detector circuits will detect the value of the power 
supply of the AVSS, and compare with AVSSTH 
threshold, then set the DAC outputs range and clamp 
DAC outputs to the corresponding AVSS value 
automatically. If VAVSS is lower than VAVSSTH, the DACs 
output will be set to -10V to 0V range. If VAVSS is higher 
than VAVSSTH, the DACs output will be set to 0V to 5V 
range. Simultaneously the DAC outputs will be clamped 
to the corresponding AVSS value automatically. 
The output range can be reset by software after 
initialization.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Programming 
The SGM90516 interface is a 4-wire SPI compatible 
interface. 
The operation frame is restricted in N+2 bytes, where N 
represents the number of data bytes to be accessed. In 
MSB-first mode, the first bit of the frame is W/R 
(write/read) acknowledge bit. When it is '0', it sets a 
write operation. When it is '1', it sets a read operation. 
The next 15 bits are the register address, which means 
32768 addressable registers. The remaining bits are 
data. In a write operation, the data is shifted in on the 
rising edge of SCLK. In a read operation, the data is 
shifted out on the falling edge of SCLK. Note that, in 
writing operation, if the clocks are not an even multiple 
of 8 clocks, the writing is invalid. 
The access protocol used by the interface is illustrated 
in Figure 13 and Figure 14.

Streaming Mode Operation 
In stream mode, multiple bytes of data can be written or 
read in one frame operation. In this mode, a single byte 
or multiple bytes are accessed, which is configured in 
interface configuration 1 register (REG0x01). And the 
data to be accessed in increased address sequence or 
decreased 
address 
sequence 
is 
configured 
by 
ADDR_ASCEND bit in interface configuration 0 register 
(REG0x00[5]). 
In stream mode, when the address is increased, if the 
address 0x7FFF is reached, the next address will loop 
back to 0x0000. When the address is decreased, if the 
address is 0x0000 is reached, the next address will 
loop back to 0x7FFF. Note that when in continuous 
operations, as 0x0001 is the configuration register 
address, writing to this register may change the 
configuration of the serial interface. 
The access protocol used in streaming mode is 
illustrated in Figure 15 and Figure 16.

CMODE 
0 
R/W 
ADC Conversion Mode Bit. This bit is used for selecting the ADC conversion mode. 
0 = Direct mode. If there is a trigger signal, all selected channels are converted in 
sequence, and then ADC goes to IDLE state. The ADC waits in IDLE state until a new 
trigger signal is issued. 
1 = Auto mode. If there is a trigger signal, all selected channels will be converted in 
sequence. When a cycle is completed, a new cycle will be started automatically. It will 
not stop until a second trigger signal occurs. In this mode, ADC_UPDATE bit 
(REG0x0F[4]) must be set to update the latest conversion result to the ADC Data 
Registers. 
D[6:5]

R/W

D[4] 
ADC_REF_BUFF (1) 
0 
R/W 
ADC Reference Buffer Bit. After the device is powered up, it must be set to '1' to enable 
the internal reference buffer.

1 = enabled 
D[3:1]

R/W 
Reserved 
D[0] 
TMPSR_CHOP 
0 
R/W 
Temp Sensor Buffer Offset Polarity. Averaging temp sensor output for higher accuracy is 
possible by toggling this bit. 
0 = positive buffer offset 
1 = negative buffer offset 
 
NOTE: 
1. Be noted that it will take about 5ms for the REF_CMP voltage fully settling after the ADC_REF_BUFF bit (which is D[4] in ADC 
configuration register) is enabled from a previous disabled status and at same time at least one ADC channel is selected in ADC 
MUX configuration registers (which is set by registers 0x13 to 0x15). Before the REF_CMP voltage fully settles, any ADC conversion 
result is untrusted, and any ADC conversion operation is not recommended. The REF_CMP voltage settling time depends on the 
decoupling capacitor. The REF_CMP voltage settling time is a setting time when the internal reference source charges to the 
external decoupling capacitor. The REF_CMP voltage does not need a settling time when the ADC_REF_BUFF bit is enabled from 
a previous enabled status and any ADC channels that are selected by ADC MUX configuration registers are re-configured. For all 
the upping explanations, assume that the internal reference is already enabled by setting PREF bit (which is configured in register 
0xB4).
