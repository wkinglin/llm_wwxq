Shunt Mode Audio Click-Pop Eliminator

GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM4807 is an audio click-pop eliminator which 
can operate from a 1.7V to 5V single power supply. It is 
designed for portable devices. 
The SGM4807 provides a low-impedance grounding 
path during startup and shutdown by connecting to the 
output of the system amplifier. It allows -VCC to +VCC 
wide range audio signals passing with low distortion. 
Shunt mode can eliminate the click-pop noise. 
The SGM4807 has two low-impedance analog 
switches. The opening and closing of the switches are 
controlled by mute events that include external power 
supply 
and 
under-voltage 
of 
VCC, 
power-up, 
power-down and high to low logical level change of 
MUTE pin. Opening switches during normal operation 
will not affect the output signal. 
The SGM4807 can be activated during startup and 
shutdown of the amplifier to short-circuit the output to 
the ground and reduce clicks-pops. 
The SGM4807 is available in Green TDFN-2×2-8L, 
MSOP-8 and WLCSP-1.57×0.80-8B packages. It 
operates over an ambient temperature range of -40℃ 
to +85℃. 
FEATURES 
• Supply Voltage Range: 1.7V to 5V 
• Pop/Click Reduction Circuitry 
• Supply Current: 1.5μA (TYP) 
• 600kΩ Pull-Low Resistor at MUTE Pin

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.
