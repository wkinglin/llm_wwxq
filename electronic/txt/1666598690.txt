GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM6036 family is a 600mA, 1.4MHz synchronous 
Buck DC/DC converter with 450nA ultra-low quiescent 
current, which is ideal for powering ultra-low power 
applications with special needs. 
The SGM6036 operation voltage range is from 1.8V to 
5.5V, allowing the use of a regulated 5V input. The 
SGM6036 is available in both adjustable and fixed 
output voltage versions. The output voltage of 
SGM6036 can be programmed by an external resistor 
divider in adjustable version. 
The SGM6036 delivers an output current of 600mA with 
a peak inductor current of 940mA. Besides, the 
SGM6036 series has the under-voltage lockout (UVLO) 
function. It is disabled when the voltage on VIN reaches 
the UVLO condition. The SGM6036’s under-voltage 
lockout level is continuously monitored. Only the 
inductor, CIN and COUT capacitors are needed as 
external components to make a Buck DC/DC converter 
solution. 
The SGM6036 is available in a Green UTDFN-1.5×2-6L 
package.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
The SGM6036 family is a synchronous Buck converter 
with ultra-low quiescent current of 450nA (TYP). The 
device is improved to provide high efficiency ranging 
from 10μA to 600mA.  
The SGM6036 implements the hysteretic control 
architecture to regulate the output voltage. The 450nA 
(TYP) quiescent current extends the operation lifetime 
for battery operated applications. 
 
Operation 
The SGM6036 family is a Buck converter that is 
capable to regulate the voltage that is lower than the 
input voltage at the output. The device implements the 
pulse frequency modulation (PFM) control to regulate 
the voltage at light load. The SGM6036 delivers an 
average output current of 600mA with a peak inductor 
current of 940mA (TYP). The device implements an 
input under-voltage lockout (UVLO) function. When the 
input voltage drops below the UVLO threshold, the 
device stops operation. In addition to input UVLO 
function, the SGM6036 also implements the EN pin to 
allow external signal to control the turn-on and turn-off 
of the device. The device also implements output 
discharge function, when the EN pin is pulled to logic 
low, the low-side power FET remains on to discharge 
the output voltage. The SGM6036 also implements 100% 
duty cycle mode to bypass the input voltage to the 
output when the input voltage is above the UVLO 
threshold.  
 
Under-Voltage Lockout (UVLO) 
The device monitors the input voltage and shuts down 
itself when the input voltage is lower than UVLO 
threshold voltage. When the input voltage is higher 
than the UVLO threshold plus hysteresis, the device 
will start again. 
 
Thermal Shutdown (TSD) 
A thermal shutdown function is implemented to prevent 
the damage caused by excessive heat and power 
dissipation. Once a temperature of +160°C (TYP) is 
exceeded, the device is shut down. The device is 
released from shutdown automatically when the 
junction temperature decreases by 20℃. 
 
Nano-Power Management and Efficiency 
The SGM6036 implements the nano-power circuitry 
and algorithm to achieve 450nA (TYP) quiescent 
current. This feature is accomplished through sampling 
and all references are saved, so as to lower the 
average quiescent current. During the sampling and 
saving, the internal circuits are only turned on for a 
short period of time and then turned off in the remaining 
time at the lowest feasible duty cycle.

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
The SGM6036 family has ultra-low quiescent current 
and is capable of delivering up to 600mA load current, 
which is suitable for battery operated applications.  
 
Setting the Output Voltage 
The output voltage is set by a resistor divider between 
the output voltage and the FB pin. The voltage divider 
divides the output voltage down to the feedback voltage 
by the ratio: 
2
FB
OUT
1
2
R
V
V
R
R
=
+
 
where VFB is the feedback voltage and VOUT is the 
output voltage. Thus, the output voltage is: 
1
2
OUT
2
R
R
V
1.0
R
+
=
×
 
The value for R2 can be as high as 1MΩ. 
For example, for a 2V output voltage, R2 is 1MΩ, and 
R1 is 1MΩ. 
 
Design Procedure 
A 4.7μH inductor and a 22μF input ceramic capacitor 
are recommended for the SGM6036. Since the device 
only supports 600mA output load, a 22 μ F output 
ceramic capacitor is sufficient. For applications that are 
expected to have a large transient event, use ITRAN = 
COUT × ΔVOUT/ΔTIME to size the output capacitor 
accordingly, where ΔVOUT is the amount of output 
voltage drop during load step.  
 
Inductor Selection 
The SGM6036 is optimized to work with a 4.7μH 
inductor. The selected inductor’s saturation current 
should be at least 25% higher than the maximum 
cycle-by-cycle current limit specified in the Electrical 
Characteristics table. The SGM6036 is naturally stable 
due to its hysteretic control architecture. 
The recommended inductors for SGM6036 are shown 
in Table 1.

Output Capacitor Selection 
A minimal of 22μF ceramic output capacitor is 
recommended for SGM6036. Larger size will result in 
higher effective capacitance under the same DC 
de-rating, which improves the transient response and 
output ripple.  
 
Input Capacitor Selection 
A 22μF ceramic capacitor and a 0.1μF ceramic bypass 
input capacitor are recommended to place between the 
VIN pin and GND as close as possible to minimize the 
parasitic inductance. For applications where the 
SGM6036 is located far away from the input source, a 
22µF or higher capacitor is recommended to damp the 
inductance of the wiring harness.
