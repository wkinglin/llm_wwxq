APRIL2014–REV.A. 1 
GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM4560 is used for power conversion and level 
translation of the signal in the application of CA cards. 
Also, it can be used for the applications of 3.3V or 5.0V 
CA cards, which is powered by its internal LDOs from 
3.3V to 5.5V input signal. The value of the output 
voltage can be controlled with the voltage selection 
pins of the SGM4560 with the maximum load current of 
200mA. 
The level translator integrated on the SGM4560 can 
boost the input signal which is powered by 1.6V to 3.3V 
or 5.0V interface. The lifespan of the battery can be 
enhanced as the 100μA (TYP) operating current and 
1μA (MAX) shutdown current. 
The SGM4560 is available in a Green TSSOP-14 
package. It operates over an ambient temperature 
range of -40℃ to +85℃.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.

NAME 
FUNCTION 
1 
CIN 
Controller Clock Input Pin. 
2 
RIN 
Controller Reset Input Pin. 
3 
DATA 
Controller Bidirectional Data Input/Output Pin. A weak pull-up current source ensures that the DATA 
pin is held HIGH during shutdown, as long as DVCC is powered. 
4 
SHDN 
Controller Driven Shutdown Pin. This pin goes to high (DVCC) in the normal operation, and the pin 
goes to low when in the shutdown mode. 
5 
VSEL 
Select Pin for VCC Voltage. Select VCC = 3.3V for the low level and VCC = 5.0V for driving the pin to 
DVCC. 
6 
DVCC 
Controller Supply Voltage, for the Input/Output Pins (CIN, RIN, DATA). Bypass with a 1μF ceramic 
capacitor to GND. 
7, 14 
NC 
No Connection. 
8 
VP 
VCC Supply Input Pin. It can be operated between 3.3V and 5.5V. It is recommended to use a 1μF or 
larger ceramic capacitor from VP pin to GND to get good power supply decoupling. This ceramic 
capacitor should be placed as close as possible to VP pin. 
9 
VCC 
CA Card VCC Supply Voltage. It is recommended to use a 1μF ceramic capacitor to ensure stability. 
This ceramic capacitor should be placed as close as possible to VCC pin. The pin is discharged to 
GND in the shutdown mode. 
10 
I/O 
CA Card Bidirectional Data Input/Output Pin. The pin is pulled to GND in the shutdown mode. 
11 
RST 
CA Card Reset Output Pin. The pin is pulled to GND in the shutdown mode. 
12 
GND 
Ground. 
13 
CLK 
CA Card Clock Output Pin. The pin is pulled to GND in the shutdown mode. Careful board layout of 
CLK pin is necessary for fast rising and falling edges.
