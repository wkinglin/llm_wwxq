GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM9131 is a 3-channel, 6th-order output 
reconstruction filter which can operate from 3.1V to 
5.5V single power supply. It is designed to replace 
passive LC filters and drivers with an integrated device. 
Three channels are High Definition (HDi) filters. 
The device allows DC- or AC-coupled output. 
SGM9131 can be DC-coupled or AC-coupled with input 
video signal to eliminate out-of-band noise, such as the 
output stage of DAC. Internal bias circuitry may be 
used for providing constant bias voltage if AC-coupled 
inputs are required. 
The SGM9131 is available in a Green SOIC-8 package. 
It operates over an ambient temperature range of -40℃ 
to +85℃. 
 
FEATURES 
● Supply Voltage Range: 3.1V to 5.5V 
● Three 6th-Order 1080i High Definition Filters 
● Bias Mode Active with AC-Coupled Inputs 
● Bias Mode Inactive with DC-Coupled Inputs 
● AC- or DC-Coupled Outputs 
● DC-Coupled Outputs Eliminate AC-Coupled  
Capacitors 
● -40℃ to +85℃ Operating Temperature Range 
● Available in a Green SOIC-8 Package

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.
