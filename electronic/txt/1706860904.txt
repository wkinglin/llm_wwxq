GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM2231 is a low power, low noise, fast transient 
response and low dropout voltage linear regulator. It 
provides -500mA output current capability. The 
operating input voltage range is from -2.7V to -24V. The 
adjustable output voltage range is from -1.1V to (-VIN +

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may 
affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.

PIN DESCRIPTION 
PIN 
NAME 
FUNCTION 
1 
OUT 
Regulator Output Pin. It is recommended to use a ceramic capacitor with effective capacitance 
in the range of 1.5μF to 10μF to ensure stability. This ceramic capacitor should be placed as 
close as possible to the OUT pin. 
2 
SENSE/ADJ 
Sense or Adjust Input Pin. For fixed output voltage version, this pin is connected to load or the 
OUT pin directly. For adjustable output voltage version, this pin is connected to the midpoint of 
an external resistor divider to set the output voltage lower than the fixed output voltage (-1.1V). 
3, 4, 7 
NC 
Not Connected. 
5 
EN 
Enable Pin. Drive EN 2.0V above or below ground to turn on the regulator. Drive EN to ground 
to turn off the regulator. Connect the EN pin to the IN pin when using automatic startup. 
6 
GND 
Ground. 
8 
IN 
Input Voltage Supply Pin. It is recommended to use a 2.2μF or larger ceramic capacitor from 
the IN pin to ground to get good power supply decoupling. This ceramic capacitor should be 
placed as close as possible to the IN pin. 
Exposed Pad 
IN 
Exposed Pad. Connect the exposed pad at the bottom of the package to the internal IN for 
maximum thermal performance. In normal use, connect the exposed pad to the IN on the 
board, which is the most negative potential in the negative voltage regulating circuit.

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
The SGM2231 is a low quiescent current, low noise and 
low dropout LDO and provides -500mA output current. 
These features make the device a reliable solution to 
solve many challenging problems in the generation of 
clean 
and 
accurate 
power 
supply. 
The 
high 
performance also makes the SGM2231 useful in a variety 
of applications. The SGM2231 provides the protection 
functions for output overload, output short-circuit 
condition and overheating. 
The SGM2231 provides an EN pin as an external chip 
enable control to enable/disable the device. When the 
regulator is in shutdown state, the shutdown current 
consumes as low as -1.2μA (TYP). 
 
Input Capacitor Selection (CIN) 
The input decoupling capacitor should be placed as 
close as possible to the IN pin to ensure the device 
stability. A 2.2μF or larger X7R or X5R ceramic 
capacitor is selected to get good dynamic performance. 
When VIN is required to provide large current 
instantaneously, a large effective input capacitor is 
required. Multiple input capacitors can reduce the 
impact from input trace inductance. Adding more input 
capacitors is available to restrict the ringing and to keep 
it below the device absolute maximum ratings. 
 
Output Capacitor Selection (COUT) 
The output capacitor should be placed as close as 
possible to the OUT pin. A 2.2μF or larger X7R or X5R 
ceramic capacitor is selected to get good dynamic 
performance. The minimum effective capacitance of 
COUT that SGM2231 can remain stable is 1.5μF. For 
ceramic capacitor, temperature, DC bias and package 
size will change the effective capacitance, so enough 
margin of COUT must be considered in design. 
Additionally, COUT with larger capacitance and lower 
ESR will help increase the high frequency PSRR and 
improve the load transient response. 
 
Adjustable Regulator 
For the SGM2231-ADJ, set the output voltage by using 
a resistor divider as shown in Figure 3. Choose R2 less 
than 110kΩ to maintain a 10μA minimum load. 
Calculate the value for the output voltage using the 
following equation: 
VOUT = -1.1V × (1 + R1/R2)           (1)

Enable Operation 
The EN pin of the SGM2231 is used to enable/disable 
the OUT pin under normal operating conditions. 
Connect the EN pin to the IN pin when using automatic 
startup. 
When EN is at ±2.0V with respect to GND, the device is 
in active state. When EN is at 0V, the device is in 
shutdown state. In this state, a discharge resistor 
around 200kΩ connects to the OUT pin and pulls the 
OUT pin up to GND. 
The EN pin of the SGM2231 is bipolar, even though the 
enable voltage can be positive or negative. 
The typical hysteresis of the EN pin is shown in Figure 
4. This feature is used to prevent on/off oscillations due 
to noise on the EN pin when it passes the threshold 
point.

APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued) 
Reverse Current Protection 
The pass transistor has an inherent body diode which 
will be forward biased in the case when VOUT < (VIN - 
0.3V). If extended reverse voltage operation is 
anticipated, external limiting might be appropriate. 
 
Output Current Limit and Short-Circuit 
Protection 
When overload events happen, the output current is 
internally limited to -1.2A (TYP). When the OUT pin is 
shorted to ground, the short-circuit protection will limit 
the output current to -410mA (TYP). 
 
Thermal Shutdown 
When the die temperature exceeds the threshold value 
of thermal shutdown, the SGM2231 will be in shutdown 
state and it will remain in this state until the die 
temperature decreases to +140℃. 
 
Power Dissipation (PD) 
Power dissipation (PD) of the SGM2231 can be 
calculated by the equation PD = |VIN - VOUT| × IOUT. The 
maximum allowable power dissipation (PD(MAX)) of the 
SGM2231 is affected by many factors, including the 
difference between junction temperature and ambient 
temperature (TJ(MAX) - TA), package thermal resistance 
from the junction to the ambient environment (θJA), the 
rate of ambient airflow and PCB layout. PD(MAX) can be 
approximated by the following equation:  
PD(MAX) = (TJ(MAX) - TA)/θJA           (2) 
 
Layout Guidelines 
To get good PSRR, low output noise and high transient 
response performance, the input and output bypass 
capacitors must be placed as close as possible to the IN 
pin and OUT pin separately.
