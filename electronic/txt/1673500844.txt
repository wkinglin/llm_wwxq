GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The 74AVC4T245Q is a 4-bit, dual-supply voltage level 
transceiver with 3-state outputs and bidirectional level 
translation. The device can be used as two 2-bit 
transceivers or one 4-bit transceiver. The nAn and nBn 
are four data input-output ports. nDIR are the direction 
control inputs and nOE
ത
ത
ത
ത
ത are the output enable inputs. 
VCCA and VCCB are the supply pins. The supply voltage 
of VCCA and VCCB can range from 0.8V to 3.6V, making 
the device suitable for bidirectional translating among 
any of the 0.8V, 1.2V, 1.5V, 1.8V, 2.5V and 3.3V 
voltage nodes. The nAn, nDIR and nOE
ത

ത
ത
ത signals are 
referenced to VCCA and nBn signals are referenced to 
VCCB. 
When nDIR is set high, it allows transmission from nAn 
to nBn. When nDIR is set low, it allows transmission 
from nBn to nAn. nOE

ത
ത
ത can be used to make the 
outputs disabled so that the buses are effectively 
isolated. In suspend mode, both nAn and nBn are in 
high-impedance state when either VCCA or VCCB input is 
at GND level. 
This device is highly suitable for partial power-down 
applications using power-off leakage current (IOFF) circuit. 
When the device is powered down, the current backflow 
will be prevented from passing through the device. 
This 
device 
is 
AEC-Q100 
qualified 
(Automotive 
Electronics Council Standard Q100 Grade 1) and the 
use of this device is suitable for automotive applications.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
1. Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may 
affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
2. The input and output voltage ratings may be exceeded if 
the input and output clamp current ratings are observed. 
3. The performance capability of a high-performance integrated 
circuit in conjunction with its thermal environment can create 
junction temperatures which are detrimental to reliability. 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.
