GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The 
SGM4553YXET 
is 
a 
2-bit, 
non-inverting, 
bidirectional voltage-level translator which features two 
independent configurable power-supply lines. The A 
and B ports track the VCCA supply and VCCB supply 
respectively. The supply voltage range is 1.65V to 5.5V 
for A ports and 2.3V to 5.5V for B ports. The device 
provides a bidirectional translation function among the 
different voltage nodes (including 1.8V, 2.5V, 3.3V and 
5V). 
The SGM4553YXET has an output enable (OE) 
function, which controls the inputs and outputs states. 
When 
OE 
goes 
low, 
all 
I/Os 
enter 
into 
the 
high-impedance state. It is beneficial for reducing 
quiescent current consumption. When VCCA is powered, 
OE has an internal pull-down current source. 
The 
SGM4553YXET 
is 
available 
in 
a 
Green 
XTDFN-1.35×1-8L package. It operates over an 
ambient temperature range of -40℃ to +85℃.

NOTES: 
1. When the input and output current ratings are observed, 
the input and I/O negative voltage ratings may be exceeded. 
2. VCCA and VCCB values are shown in the recommended 
operating conditions in Electrical Characteristics section. 
 
RECOMMENDED OPERATING CONDITIONS 
Operating Temperature Range ....................... 
-40℃ to +85℃ 
OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
Applications 
The SGM4553YXET is a bridge between two digital systems 
with different power supplies as it can transmit the signal 
transparently. For the application of the SGM4553YXET, the 
output driver is open-drain or push-pull to drive the I2C or 
one-wire bus. In addition, if a device with push-pull driver is 
connected to the I/O pin of the SGM4553YXET, it will operate as 
normal. 
 
Architecture 
The SGM4553YXET can switch the direction of the 
transmission for port A and port B automatically without any 
external control. 
There is no need to add an external direction control for the 
application of the SGM4553YXET. Also, each I/O pin can be 
an input or output of the voltage translator.

Figure 7. Architecture of an SGM4553YXET Cell 
 
The explanation of two main parts of the internal circuit for the 
SGM4553YXET is shown as below: 
 There is an NMOS between port A and port B to switch on 
or off the transmission. 
 The one-shot accelerator can be used to accelerate the 
rising edges of the signal for port A and port B 
automatically. 
 
Input Driver Requirements 
The falling time of port A and port B and tPHL depend on the 
output impedance of the connected device. The values of 
parameters which are tfA, tfB, tPHL and data rates are specified 
when the resistance of external driver is less than 50Ω. 
Power-Up 
For the application of the SGM4553YXET, the VCCA should be 
less than VCCB. However, it does not matter if the power 
supply voltage is ramping, and the sequence of power-up for 
both VCCA and VCCB is not defined.  
 
Output Load Considerations 
To decrease the extend of capacitive loading and ensure the 
proper triggering of O.S., the trace in PCB should be as short 
as possible. Also, to ensure that the round-trip reflection delay 
is smaller than the time period of one-shot, the users should 
also decrease the length of trace, which means that the signal 
integrity is guaranteed because of the low impedance for the 
reflection. The period of on-state for the O.S. part is 30ns. In 
addition, for the one-shot circuit, it can support lumped 
capacitive load. In addition, the one-shot circuit has the 
time-out function, which aims to handle the extremely heavy 
capacitive load. For the function of O.S. part of the 
SGM4553YXET, it can optimize the trade-off between the 
capability of load driving, maximum bit-rate and dynamic 
supply current. The length of PCB trace and output 
connectors will be considered as the capacitive load of the 
device, which may result in the retriggering of O.S., 
contention of bus and the oscillations of the output. 
 
Enable and Disable 
The function of OE is used to disable SGM4553YXET by 
setting the transmitting I/O pins to high-impedance mode. The 
pull-down current source is integrated inside OE once it is 
powered by VCCA. The definition of disable time (tDIS) is the 
time period between OE goes low and when all of the I/O pins 
are in high-impedance mode. The enable time (tEN) is defined 
as the time period between OE goes to high position and 
one-shot part starts to operate. 
 
Pull-Up or Pull-Down Resistors on I/O Lines 
For the I/O pin of A and B side, there is a 10kΩ pull-up resistor 
to provide a high position for each I/O pin. However, if a 
smaller pull-up resistor is required, the users can add an 
external resistor which is parallel with the 10kΩ resistor. Also, 
the value of VOL can be affected by the added external 
resistor. In addition, if the user wants to disable the device, 
the OE pin can be simply set to low position.
