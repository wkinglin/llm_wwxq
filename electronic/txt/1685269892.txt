GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM61432 is a current mode controlled non- 
synchronous Buck converter with 4V to 40V input range 
and 3.5A continuous output current. A low RDSON 
N-MOSFET is integrated as high-side switch. Moreover, 
the low 38μA quiescent current and low shutdown current 
of only 1.3μA (TYP) make it a suitable choice for 
battery-powered applications. Also, the internal loop 
compensation simplifies compensation network design 
and saves user design time and cost. The UVLO level 
can be adjusted (increased) by an external resistor 
divider. Switching frequency can be selected over a 
wide range (200kHz to 2500kHz) to allow desired tradeoff 
among efficiency, component sizes and conversion 
voltage ratio. Protection against over-voltage transient is 
provided to limit the startup or other transient 
overshoots. Secure operation in overload conditions is 
ensured by cycle-by-cycle current limit, frequency 
fold-back and thermal shutdown protection. 
The SGM61432 is available in a Green SOIC-8 
(Exposed Pad) package.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged by ESD if you don’t 
pay attention to ESD protection. SGMICRO recommends that 
all integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because very small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet its published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
Overview 
The SGM61432 is a 40V Buck converter with an 
integrated 
N-MOSFET 
power 
switch 
and 
3.5A 
continuous output current capability. Using peak current 
mode control, this device provides good line and load 
transient responses with reduced output capacitance. 
The minimum operating input voltage of the device is 
4V and its nominal frequency is 500kHz. The quiescent 
current is 38μA. It reduces to 1.3μA if the device is 
disabled. The low RDSON high-side switch (93mΩ) 
allows high operating efficiency. 
The EN pin is internally pulled up by a current source 
that can keep the device enabled if EN is floating. It can 
also be used to increase the input UVLO threshold 
using a resistor divider. 
The bootstrap diode is integrated and only a small 
capacitor between BOOT and SW pins (CBOOT) is 
needed for the MOSFET gate driving bias. A separate 
UVLO circuit monitors CBOOT voltage and turns the 
switch off if this voltage falls below a preset threshold. 
The switching frequency is adjusted by using a resistor 
to ground which is connected to the RT/CLK pin. It is 
also can be synchronized to an external clock signal. 
Over-voltage protection (OVP) circuit is designed to 
minimize the output over-voltage transients. When this 
comparator detects an OVP (VFB > 110% × VREF), the 
switch is kept off until the VFB falls below 106% of the 
VREF. 
The SS pin internal current source allows soft-start time 
adjustments with a small external capacitor. This 
feature provides more flexibility in output filter design. 
Light load efficiency is enhanced by a special power-save 
mode. 
During startup and over-current, the frequency is reduced 
(frequency fold-back) to allow easy maintenance of low 
inductor current. The thermal shutdown provides an 
additional protection in fault conditions.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Minimum Input Voltage (4V) and UVLO 
The recommended minimum operating input voltage is 
4V. It may operate with lower voltages that are above 
the VIN rising UVLO threshold (3.85V TYP). If VIN falls 
below its falling UVLO threshold, the device will stop 
switching. 
 
Enable Input and UVLO Adjustment 
An internal current source pull-up keeps the EN pin 
voltage at high state by default. The device will enable 
if the EN pin voltage exceeds the enable threshold of 
1.19V and VIN exceeds its UVLO threshold. The device 
will disable if the EN voltage is externally pulled low or 
the VIN pin voltage falls below its UVLO threshold. 
If an application requires a higher input UVLO threshold, 
an 
external 
input 
UVLO 
adjustment 
circuit 
is 
recommended in Figure 3. Figure 3 shows how UVLO 
and hysteresis are increased using REN1 and REN2. A 
3.4μA additional current is injected to the divider when 
EN pin voltage exceeds VENH (1.19V) to provide 
hysteresis and it will be removed when EN pin voltage 
is below VENL (1.11V). Use Equations 1 and 2 to 
calculate these resistors. VSTART is the input start 
(turn-on) threshold voltage and VSTOP is the input stop 
(turn-off) threshold voltage.

Synchronization to RT/CLK Pin 
The internal oscillator can synchronize to an external 
logic clock applied to the RT/CLK pin (see Figure 4) in 
the 250kHz to 2300kHz range. The SW rising edge 
(switch turn-on) is synchronized with the CLK falling 
edge. The CLK low and high levels must be less than 
0.7V and more than 1.7V and have a pulse width larger 
than 30ns. So, when the CLK source is off, the DC 
resistance (RT) between RT/CLK and GND pins 
determines the default switching frequency.

The switching frequency can be set from 200kHz to

RT/CLK and GND pins. There is an internal bias 
voltage (0.5V TYP) on the RT/CLK pin during the RT 
mode and must have a resistor to ground to set the 
switching frequency. Use Equation 3 to find the RT 
resistance for any desired switching frequency (fSW).

Low Dropout Operation and Bootstrap 
Gate Driving (BOOT Pin) 
An internal regulator provides the bias voltage for gate 
driver using a 0.1μF ceramic capacitor. X5R or better 
dielectric types are recommended. The capacitor must 
have a 10V or higher voltage rating. 
The SGM61432 operates at maximum duty cycle when 
input voltage is closed to output voltage as long as the 
bootstrap voltage (VBOOT - VSW) is greater than its UVLO 
threshold. When the bootstrap voltage falls below its 
UVLO, the high-side switch is turned off, and the 
integrated low-side switch is turned on to recharge the 
BOOT capacitor. After the recharge, the high-side switch 
is turned on again to regulate the output.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
SS Pin and Soft-Start Adjustment 
It is recommended to add a soft-start capacitor (CSS) 
between the SS and GND pins to set the soft-start time 
from 1ms to 10ms for a proper startup. The lower of the 
SS pin voltage VSS and VREF is applied to the error 
amplifier to regulate the output. The internal ISS = 3μA 
current charges CSS and provides a linear voltage ramp 
on the SS pin. Use Equation 4 to calculate the soft-start 
time.

Slope Compensation 
Without implementing some slope compensation, the 
PWM pulse widths will be unstable and oscillatory at 
duty cycles above 50%. To avoid sub-harmonic 
oscillations in this device, an internal compensation 
ramp is added to the measured switch current before 
comparing it with the control signal by the PWM 
comparator. 
 
Power-Save Mode 
At light loads, the SGM61432 employs pulse-skipping 
power-save mode (PSM) to maintain its high efficiency 
by reducing the number of switching pulses. When the 
peak inductor current falls below the PSM current 
threshold, the corresponding internal COMP voltage 
(VCOMP) drops below the internal threshold. In such 
cases, the device will enter PSM to conserve power 
and improve efficiency. 
After entering PSM for a delay time, some modules are 
shut down to minimum input current, and the device 
draws only 38μA (TYP) input quiescent current. The 
device can exit PSM if VCOMP rises above the internal 
threshold and the peak inductor current exceeds 
current threshold. During PSM operation, the peak 
inductor current is the sensed parameter for entering 
the PSM, and the actual load current (DC) threshold for 
PSM will depend on the output filter. 
 
Over-Current Protection and Frequency 
Fold-back 
Over-current protection (OCP) is naturally provided by 
current mode control. In each cycle, the high-side 
current sensing starts a short time (blanking time) after 
the high-side switch is turned on. The sensed high-side 
switch current is continuously compared with the 
current limit threshold and when the high-side current 
reaches to that threshold, the high-side switch is turned 
off. If the output is overloaded, VOUT will drop and VCOMP 
will be increased by EA to compensate that, while the 
EA output (VCOMP) is clamped to a maximum value. By 
limiting VCOMP (maximum peak current), the output 
current can actually be limited precisely. 
The natural OCP of the peak current mode control may 
not be able to provide a complete protection when an 
output short-circuit occurs and an extra protection 
mechanism for short-circuit is needed. During an output 
short, inductor current may runaway above over-current 
limits because of the high input voltage and the 
minimum controllable on-time. During an output short, 
the inductor current decreases slowly because a small 
negative diode forward voltage appears across the 
inductor during the off-time, which results in the 
inductor current cannot be reset. In these conditions, 
current can saturate the inductor and the current may 
even increase higher until the device is damaged. In 
the SGM61432, this problem is effectively solved 
through increasing the off-time during short-circuit by 
reducing the switching frequency (frequency fold-back). 
As the output voltage drops and the FB pin voltage falls 
from 0.75V to 0V, the frequency will be divided by 1, 2, 
4 and 8. 
 
Over-Voltage Transient Protection 
When an overload or an output fault condition is 
removed, large overshoots may occur on the output. 
The SGM61432 includes over-voltage protection (OVP) 
circuit to reduce such over-voltage transients. If VFB 
voltage exceeds 110% of the VREF threshold, the 
MOSFET is turned off. When it returns below 106% of 
the VREF threshold, the MOSFET is released again. 
 
Thermal Shutdown (TSD) 
If the junction temperature (TJ) exceeds +175℃, the 
TSD protection circuit will stop switching to protect the 
device from overheating. The device will automatically 
restart with a power up sequence when the junction 
temperature drops below +155℃.

Switching Frequency Selection 
Several parameters such as losses, inductor and 
capacitors sizes and response time are considered in 
selection of the switching frequency. Higher frequency 
increases the switching and gate charge losses, and 
lower frequency requires larger inductance and 
capacitances, which results in larger overall physical 
size and higher cost. Therefore, a tradeoff is needed 
between losses and component size. If the application 
is noise-sensitive to a frequency range, the frequency 
should be selected out of that range. 
For this design, a lower switching frequency of 500kHz 
is chosen and a 49.9kΩ resistor can be chosen for R3 
according to Equation 3. 
Input Capacitor Design 
A high-quality ceramic capacitor (X5R or X7R or better 
dielectric grade) must be used for input decoupling of 
the SGM61432. At least 3μF of effective capacitance 
(after deratings) is needed on the VIN input. In some 
applications, additional bulk capacitance may also be 
required for the VIN input, for example, when the 
SGM61432 is more than 5cm away from the input 
source. The VIN capacitor ripple current rating must 
also be greater than the maximum input current ripple. 
The input current root mean square (RMS) can be 
calculated using Equation 5 and the maximum value 
occurs at 50% duty cycle. Using the design example 
values, IOUT = 3.5A, yields an RMS input ripple current 
of 1.75A.

For this design, a ceramic capacitor with at least 50V 
voltage rating is required to support the maximum input 
voltage. So, 2 × 10µF/50V capacitors in parallel are 
selected for VIN to cover all DC bias, thermal and aging 
deratings. The input capacitance determines the 
regulator input voltage ripple. This ripple can be 
calculated from Equation 6. In this example, the total 
effective capacitance of the 2 × 10µF/50V capacitors is 
around 10µF at 12V input, and the input voltage ripple 
is 200mV.

APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued) 
It is recommended to place an additional small size 
0.1µF ceramic capacitor right beside VIN and GND pins 
(anode of the diode) for high frequency filtering. 
 
Inductor Design 
Equation 7 is conventionally used to calculate the 
output inductance of a Buck converter. Generally, a 
smaller inductor is preferred to allow larger bandwidth 
and smaller size. The ratio of inductor current ripple (∆IL) 
to the maximum output current (IOUT) is represented as 
KIND factor (∆IL/IOUT). The inductor ripple current is 
bypassed and filtered by the output capacitor and the 
inductor DC current is passed to the output. Inductor 
ripple is selected based on a few considerations. The 
peak inductor current (IOUT + ∆IL/2) must have a safe 
margin from the saturation current of the inductor in the 
worst-case conditions, especially if a hard-saturation 
core type inductor (such as ferrite) is chosen. For peak 
current mode converter, selecting an inductor with 
saturation current above the switch current limit is 
sufficient. The ripple current also affects the selection of 
the output capacitor. COUT RMS current rating must be 
higher than the inductor RMS ripple. Typically, a 20% to 
40% ripple is selected (KIND = 0.2 ~ 0.4). Choosing a 
higher KIND value reduces the selected inductance, 
however, a too high KIND factor may result in insufficient 
slope compensation.

In this example, the calculated inductance will be

peak inductor current calculations are summarized in 
Equations 8, 9 and 10 respectively.

Note that during startup, load transients or the peak 
inductor current under fault conditions may exceed the 
calculated IL_PEAK. Therefore, it is always safer to 
choose the inductor saturation current higher than the 
switch current limit. 
 
External Diode 
An external power diode between the SW and GND 
pins is needed for the SGM61432 to complete the 
converter. This diode must tolerate the application’s 
absolute maximum ratings. The reverse blocking 
voltage must be higher than VIN_MAX and its peak 
current must be above the maximum inductor current. 
Choose a diode with small forward voltage drop for 
higher efficiency. Typically, diodes with higher voltage 
and current ratings have higher forward voltages. A 
diode with a minimum of 50V reverse voltage is 
preferred to allow input voltage transients up to the 
rated voltage of the SGM61432. 
 
Output Capacitor 
Three primary criteria must be considered for design of 
the output capacitor (COUT): 
1. The converter pole location. 
2. The output voltage ripple. 
3. The transient response to a large change in load 
current. 
The selected value must satisfy all of them. The desired 
transient response is usually expressed as maximum 
overshoot, 
maximum 
undershoot, 
or 
maximum 
recovery time of VOUT in response to a large load step. 
Transient response is usually a more stringent criterion 
in low output voltage applications. The output capacitor 
must provide the increased load current or absorb the 
excess inductor current (when the load current steps 
down) until the control loop can re-adjust the current of 
the inductor to the new load level. Typically, it requires 
two or more cycles for the loop to detect the output 
change and respond (change the duty cycle). Another 
requirement may also be expressed as desired hold-up 
time in which the output capacitor must hold the output 
voltage above a certain level for a specified period if the 
input power is removed. It may also be expressed as 
the maximum output voltage drop or rise when the full 
load is connected or disconnected (100% load step).

Equation 11 can be used to calculate the minimum 
output capacitance that is needed to supply a current 
step (ΔIOUT) for at least 2 cycles until the control loop

For example, if the acceptable transient from 1.75A to 
3.5A load step is 5%, by inserting ΔVOUT = 0.05 × 5V = 
0.25V and ΔIOUT = 1.75A, the minimum required 
capacitance will be 28μF. Note that the impact of output 
capacitor ESR on the transient is not taken into account 
in Equation 11. For ceramic capacitors, the ESR is 
generally small enough to ignore its impact on the 
calculation of ΔVOUT transient. However, for aluminum 
electrolytic and tantalum capacitors, or high current 
power supplies, the ESR contribution to ΔVOUT must be 
considered. 
When the load steps down, the excess inductor current 
will charge the capacitor and the output voltage will 
overshoot. The catch diode current cannot discharge 
COUT, so COUT must be large enough as given in 
Equation 12 to absorb the excess inductor energy with 
limited over-voltage. The excess energy absorbed in 
the output capacitor increases the voltage on the 
capacitor. The capacitor must be sized to maintain the 
desired output voltage during these transient periods. 
Equation 12 calculates the minimum capacitance 
required to keep the output-voltage overshoot to a 
desired value.

Bootstrap Capacitor Selection 
Use a 0.1μF high-quality ceramic capacitor (X7R or 
X5R) with 10V or higher voltage rating for the bootstrap 
capacitor (C5). A 5Ω to 10Ω resistor (R4) can be added 
in series with C5 to slow down switch-on speed of the 
high-side switch and reduce EMI if needed. Too high 
values for R4 may cause insufficient C5 charging in high 
duty-cycle applications. Slower switch-on speed will 
also increase switch losses and reduce efficiency. 
 
UVLO Setting 
The Input UVLO can be programmed using an external 
voltage divider on the EN pin of the SGM61432. In this 
design R1 is connected between VIN pin and EN pin 
and R2 is connected between EN pin and GND (see 
Figure 5). The UVLO has two thresholds (hysteresis), 
one for power-up (turn-on) when the input voltage is 
rising and one for power-down (turn-off) when the 
voltage is falling. In this design, the turn-on (enable to 
start switching) occurs when VIN rises above 6.74V 
(UVLO rising threshold). When the regulator is working, 
it will not stop switching (disabled) until the input falls 
below 5.52V (UVLO falling threshold). Equations 1 and 
2 are provided to calculate the resistors. For this 
example, the nearest standard resistor values are R1 = 
221kΩ and R2 = 48.7kΩ.

Layout Considerations 
PCB is an essential element of any switching power 
supply. The converter operation can be significantly 
disturbed due to the existence of the large and fast 
rising/falling voltages that can couple through stray 
capacitances to other signal paths, and also due to the 
large and fast changing currents that can interact 
through parasitic magnetic couplings, unless those 
interferences are minimized and properly managed in 
the layout design. Insufficient conductance in copper 
traces for the high current paths results in high resistive 
losses in the power paths and voltage errors. Following 
the guidelines provided here are necessary to design a 
good layout: 
 Bypass VIN pin to GND pin with low-ESR ceramic 
capacitors (X5R or X7R or better dielectric) placed 
as close as possible to VIN pin and the catch 
diode anode pin. 
 Minimize the area and path length of the loop 
formed by VIN pin, bypass capacitors connections, 
SW pin and the catch diode. 
 Connect the device GND pin directly to the 
exposed pad (Power Pad) copper area under the 
IC device. 
 Stitch the exposed pad to the internal ground 
planes and the back side of the PCB directly under 
the IC using multiple thermal vias. 
 Use a short and wide path for routing the SW pin 
to the cathode of the catch diode on the same 
layer and to the output inductor. 
 Keep the SW area minimal and away from 
sensitive signals like FB input and divider resistors 
or RT/CLK to avoid capacitive noise coupling. 
 Top side GND plane that is connected to the 
exposed pad provides the best heat removal path 
for the IC. It should be large enough for designs 
that operate with full rated loads. Thicker copper 
planes can improve heat dissipation. 
 Place the RT resistor (R3) as close as possible to 
the RT/CLK pin with short routes.
