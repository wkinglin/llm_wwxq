OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.

NOTES: 
1. Ideal input range, do not consider gain error or offset error. 
2. LSB = Least Significant Bit. 
3. The measurement is performed relative to an ideal full-scale input (INX - COM) of 2.5V at VA = 2.7V. 
4. Accumulate the first nine harmonics of the input frequency. 
5. The chip operates with VA from 2.7V to 5.5V and VREF from 1.2V to VA (maximum VREF ≤ 4.2V). However, when VA is between 
3.6V and 4.5V, the chip may not meet the specifications shown in the Electrical Characteristics table. 
6. Vary ±30%.  
7. Sampling rate is up to 1MSPS in auto-trigger mode, while the internal conversion clock frequency is 21MHz. 
8. Guaranteed by design and laboratory test, not tested in production.

NOTES:  
1. Ideal input range, do not consider gain error or offset error. 
2. LSB = Least Significant Bit. 
3. The measurement is performed relative to an ideal full-scale input (INX - COM) of 4.096V at VA = 5V. 
4. Accumulate the first nine harmonics of the input frequency. 
5. The chip operates with VA from 2.7V to 5.5V and VREF from 1.2V to VA (maximum VREF ≤ 4.2V). However, when VA is between 
3.6V and 4.5V, the chip may not meet the specifications shown in the Electrical Characteristics table. 
6. Vary ±30%. 
7. Sampling rate is up to 1MSPS in auto-trigger mode, while the internal conversion clock frequency is 21MHz. 
8. Guaranteed by design and laboratory test, not tested in production.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
Overview 
The SGM5202-14 is a low-power, high-speed, successive 
approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converter 
(ADC). It needs to work with an external voltage reference. 
The SGM5202-14 has 8 single-ended input channels. All 
inputs share the same common pin (COM pin). 
The SGM5202-14 can be driven by either an internal clock, or 
an external clock (SCLK). 
The SGM5202-14 has two working modes, manual channel 
select mode and auto channel select mode. 
 
Signal Conditioning 
For the input signal pre-conditioning, it is recommended to 
add an amplifier or a PGA (Programmable Gain Amplifier) 
between the MUXOUT pin and ADCIN pin. 
 
Analog Input 
The input signal applied to INx and COM must be limited to 
the range listed in the Electrical Characteristics table. 
The SGM5202-14 is a capacitor array SAR ADC. During the 
sampling period, there is an input current flowing into the ADC. 
The peak input current depends on the sampling rate, 
reference 
voltage, 
input 
voltage 
and 
signal 
source 
impedance. 
A driver amplifier is usually recommended to buffer the signal 
source. It makes the analog input source to charge the 
equivalent input capacitor (48pF) to a 14-bit accuracy level in 
the acquisition time (120ns). When the input capacitor is fully 
charged, no further current flows. An equivalent input circuit is 
shown in Figure 6. 
 
Driver Amplifier Choice 
In a demo circuit, the SGM8967-1 is used for the 
source-follower (unity-gain) configuration, which is shown in 
Figure 
7 
with 
the 
recommended 
RC 
filter 
values. 
Low-bandwidth input signals with low-pass filters can be used 
to minimize noise.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Device Functional Modes 
Reference 
The SGM5202-14 must be operated with an external voltage 
reference. The available range is 1.2V to 4.2V. It is 
recommended to place a 10μF decoupling capacitor between 
the reference output and the ADC REF input pin.  
 
Converter Operation 
The ADC conversion of SGM5202-14 is driven by the 
conversion clock (CCLK) source.  
The CCLK source can be selected by software either from an 
internal oscillator or an external clock (SCLK). 
When the CCLK is from the internal oscillator, its minimum 
frequency is 17.3MHz. The minimum sampling time is 3 
CCLK cycles. The minimum conversion time is 18 CCLK 
cycles. 
When the CCLK is from the external clock (SCLK), its 
maximum frequency is 42MHz. The frequency of SCLK is 
divided by a factor of two, because the CCLK is toggled on 
the rising edge of SCLK. In manual-trigger mode, the start of 
a conversion is triggered by a specific rising edge of SCLK. It 
will take a minimum 20ns to set up between the falling edge 
of nCONVST and the rising edge of SCLK. The minimum 
conversion time is 18 CCLK cycles. 
When the SCLK is used to drive ADC conversion, it must 
meet the minimum high time and low time requirements. The 
SCLK must meet the minimum rise time, fall time and low 
jitter to get the best converter performance.  
 
Manual Channel Select Mode 
To enter the manual channel select mode, it needs to take 
two steps. The first step is to set the Configuration register 
(CFR) to enable the manual channel select mode. The 
second step is to set the target channel number by 
configuring the Command register (CMR). Figure 8 shows a 
demo of the channel switching timing sequence in manual 
channel select mode.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Auto Channel Select Mode 
If the chip is configured to work in auto channel select mode, 
the chip scans all channels in a fixed order and repeats the 
cycle. The first channel of the cycle scanning starts the 
channel in manual channel mode. For example, if in manual 
channel mode, channel 3 is the conversion channel, the auto 
scanning sequence is 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 3, and so forth. Figure 9 
shows a demo of the channel switching timing sequence in 
auto channel select mode. The chip quits the scanning cycle 
after CFR bit D[11] is cleared to 0. 
 
Start of a Conversion 
The input signal is sampled on the falling edge of nCONVST, 
and the pin should be kept low for minimum of 60ns. After the 
input signal is sampled, the conversion is started at the same 
time. The conversion time is 18 CCLK cycles. The minimum 
time between two nCONVST falling pulses is 21 CCLKs. The 
time between a conversion completed and a new falling edge 
of nCONVST is the acquisition time. 
To allow multiple chips to sample simultaneously, the 
nCONVST pins of all chips can be controlled by one common 
logic controller's output (please consider the driving ability of 
controller's output pin). 
A conversion also can be triggered internally without an 
nCONVST signal. To let the chip work in auto-trigger mode, 
configure the CFR bit D[9] to 0. Under this auto-trigger mode, 
when a conversion is completed, it will take 3 more CCLK 
cycles (if the CFR bit D[8] is set to 0, see Table 4 and Table 5 
for details), the next conversion is automatically triggered. 
Total acquisition time and conversion time are 21 CCLK 
cycles (if the CFR bit D[8] is set to 0, see Table 4 and Table 5 
for details).  
The different conversion modes are shown in Table 1. 
Note that when the chip is configured to work with manual 
channel select and auto-trigger mode, it is usually used for a 
single channel conversion. If there is an input channel 
switching in this mode, the chip must be set to manual-trigger 
mode before an input MUX switching. After the channel 
switching is completed, the chip can be re-configured to work 
with manual channel select and auto-trigger mode.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Status Output Pin (nEOC/nINT) 
The function of the nEOC/nINT pin is software configurable. 
When the pin is used as nEOC output and its active polarity is 
set low, the pin will keep low throughout the conversion and 
go high if the conversion is completed. In manual-trigger 
mode, the pin goes low immediately once the nCONVST 
goes low, the pin will go high once the conversion is 
completed. In auto-trigger mode, after finishing the previous 
conversion, the pin goes high, and the pin will keep high for 
the first 3 CCLK cycles in the next conversion process frame. 
If the pin of nEOC/nINT is configured as an interrupt output 
and active low, it goes low at the end of a conversion, and will 
go high by the next read cycle.  
The function of the pin nEOC/nINT is set by CFR bit D[6]. The 
output polarity of the pin is set by CFR bit D[7]. 
 
Power-Down Modes 
The chip has 3 power-down modes, including Nap, Deep, and 
Auto-Nap. They are all controlled by CFR according bits (refer 
to Table 5 for details). 
Once the Nap power-down mode is enabled, the power 
consumption will reduce to around 2.6mA in 200ns. There are 
several ways to call the chip to quit this power-down mode, 
disable this mode, issue a wake-up command, reset CFR to 
default value, or reset the chip (software or hardware, see 
Table 4 and Table 5 for further information). It will take the 
chip 3 CCLK cycles to wake up from Nap power-down mode. 
If the Deep power-down mode is enabled, the chip will be 
shut down and the power consumption will drop to about 
25.2μA in 50ns. The wake-up time from this mode is about 
150μs. The methods of calling the chip to wake up are the 
same as waking from Nap power-down mode. 
Once the Auto-Nap power-down mode is enabled, the chip 
will go to Nap power-down automatically after the next 
conversion is completed. The power consumption will reduce 
to around 2.6mA in 200ns. To call the chip to quit Auto-Nap 
power-down mode, besides the same method as the same as 
quitting Nap power-down mode, issuing a manual channel 
select command or starting a conversion also can call the 
chip to wake up. It will take the chip 3 CCLK cycles to wake 
up from Auto-Nap power-down mode. 
Table 2 shows a comparison of the three power-down modes.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Auto-Nap and Acquisition Time 
Figure 10 shows the timing diagram for nCONVST, nEOC 
and Auto-Nap power-down signals in manual-trigger mode. 
The nCONVST signal triggers the chip to wake up. It will take 
at least 3 CCLK cycles (3 Conversion Clock Cycles) to wake 
up and 3 CCLK cycles to acquire input. 
The SGM5202-14 supports two kinds of sampling rate 
1MSPS and 500kSPS in auto-trigger mode. In 1MSPS 
sampling mode, it works in 21 CCLK cycles per conversion. In 
500kSPS sampling mode, it works in 42 CCLK cycles per 
conversion. 
The Nap power-down and Deep power-down are both 
available in 1MSPS and 500kSPS sampling modes. The 
Auto-Nap power-down is only available in 500kSPS sampling 
mode, because there is no time for the core to power down in 
1MSPS sampling rate. 
Figure 11 shows a timing diagram for the conversion 
sequence in auto-trigger mode with Auto-Nap power-down 
signals in 500kSPS sampling rate. For 16-bit word output, two 
consecutive conversions are 42 CCLK cycles apart. Nap_IN 
(active high, the signal powers down the ADC core) goes low 
6 CCLK cycles ahead of the falling edge of nCONVST_IN 
(internal signal, active low). Nap_IN calls up the ADC core. It 
takes 3 CCLK cycles to power up the ADC core, and another 
3 CCLK cycles are acquisition time. After the conversion is 
completed, the chip goes power-down automatically.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Programming 
Digital Interface 
The SCLK operation frequency of the interface is up to 
50MHz (VA = VBD = 5V). Each operation frame is started on 
the falling edge of the FS/nCS. The data input and output are 
both read on the falling edge of SCLK. The first bit of the 
output data is the most significant bit (MSB). 
One complete serial I/O operation frame starts with the falling 
edge of FS/nCS, and ends on the 16th falling edge of SCLK. 
The interface works with the controller typical SPI setting 
CPOL = 1 (clock polarity) and CPHA = 0 (clock phase). This 
means that the falling edge of FS/nCS may happens when 
the SCLK is high. On the rising edge of the FS/nCS, it does 
not need to consider whether the SCLK is high or low, as long 
as there are enough SCLK falling edges before the rising 
edge of FS/nCS. 
 
Internal Register 
The internal register is composed of 4 bits of the Command 
register (CMR) and 12 bits of the Configuration register 
(CFR). 
 
Writing to the Converter 
The chip supports two types of writing to the registers, a 4-bit 
writing to CMR only and a 16-bit writing to CMR and CFR at 
the same time. More details refer to Table 4 and Table 5. 
When there is a 4-bit command, the command will take effect 
on the 4th falling edge of SCLK. A 16-bit read or write 
command will be at least 16 SCLK cycles, and in some 
exceptional cases, it will need more than 16 SCLK cycles 
(more details refer to Table 7). 
 
Configuring the Converter and Default Mode 
A 4-bit command will take effect on the 4th falling edge of 
SCLK. A 16-bit command will take effect on the 16th falling 
edge of SCLK. 
After a power-on reset, or software reset, or hardware reset, 
the CFR will be reset to the default value. 
The SPI interface of SGM5202-14 is full duplex. For all 
commands, except read CFR, the ADC conversion result is 
output on the SDO pin.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Reading the Configuration Register 
The controller can read back the content of CFR by issuing 
the read command 1100b. The read-back data is composed 
of 4-bit (MSBs) previous ADC conversion result plus 12-bit 
CFR contents. When issuing a read CFR command, 
nCONVST is not used and regardless of the activity of 
nEOC/nINT pin.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Reading the Conversion Result 
The ADC conversion result is available when the nEOC goes 
high and it is presented to the output register on the next 
falling edge of FS/nCS. The host controller can shift out the 
data on SDO pin at any time except the restricted quiet zone. 
The quiet zone is defined as 20ns before and 20ns after the 
end of sampling time (EOS). The EOS is defined as the falling 
edge of nCONVST in manual-trigger mode. The EOS is 
defined as the end of 3rd CCLK after nEOC in auto-trigger 
mode. 
The falling edge of FS/nCS should not be set at the moment 
of the rising edge of nEOC, otherwise the ADC result will be 
corrupted. If the falling edge of FS/nCS is ahead of the nEOC, 
the previous result is read out.  
The ADC result is in 14-bit strait binary format, as shown in 
Table 6. In general, at least 14 SCLK cycles is used to read 
out, and in some exceptional cases, more than 14 SCLK 
cycles is needed, as shown in Table 7. The data is shifted out 
by MSB first. If there are more SCLK cycles, 3 TAG bits (if 
enabled) are attached at the trailing of the ADC data, the 
others are filled with all 0s.  
When FS/nCS is low, SDO is active and goes to 3-state on 
the rising edge of FS/nCS. 
Note that whenever SDO is in output state, the output number 
of data bits depends on the number of SCLK cycles. For 
example, if there are 4 SCLK cycles, the first MSBs of data 
will be shifted out. If any kind of resets happen during the 
output cycle, the SDO shifts all 1s immediately. 
If SCLK is used for the CCLK, it is not possible to shift out the 
14-bit ADC data during the sampling time (6 SCLKs) due to 
the presence of quiet zone. In this case, it is recommended to 
read the ADC result during the conversion time (36 SCLKs or 
48 SCLKs in Auto-Nap mode). 
 
TAG Mode 
The SGM5202-14 supports TAG features, which is used to 
indicate ADC result is from which input channel. When the 
TAG is enabled, at least 19 SCLK cycles (14-bit data + 2-bit 0 
+ 3-bit TAG) are required to read out all data. The TAG bits 
are attached the trailing of ADC result. TAG bits are set to 
'000' for channel 0, '001' for channel 1, and so on. TAG bits 
are set to '111' for channel 7.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Daisy-Chain Mode 
The SGM5202-14 supports daisy-chain connection. The CFR 
bit D[5] can configure the nEOC/nINT pin as the chain data 
input (CDI) pin. CDI pin is used for a secondary serial data 
input from an upstream converter. 
Figure 15 shows a typical connection of three converters in 
daisy-chain mode. 
Figure 16 shows a timing diagram in a daisy connection, the 
data in CDI pin goes through the chip to SDO, the serial input 
passes through each chip with a 16 SCLK cycles delay (TAG 
is not enabled, see Table 7 for more details about TAG) as 
long as nCS is active. The 3 chips sample and convert 
simultaneously in Figure 16.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Note that in the daisy-chain connection, the nCS must be hold 
low during the entirely data transferring period (in Figure 16, it 
is 24 SCLK cycles. Assuming TAG is not enabled, see Table 
7 for more details about TAG). 
If the nCS is toggled during the data transferring in a 
daisy-chain connection, the data stream cannot go through 
the daisy-chain, each SDO data always repeats the chip 
converter data in each nCS frame. An example of this case is 
shown in Figure 17. 
For one chip, the number of SCLK cycles of each read frame 
is determined by the combination of different read modes. 
There are different combination modes of daisy-chain mode, 
TAG mode, and the manner in which a channel is selected 
(such as auto channel select mode). Table 7 shows the 
required numbers of SCLKs for different readout modes. 
In a daisy-chain connection, the maximum SCLK frequency 
may be affected by supply voltage and load when SCLK goes 
through the connection net of the chips. When the chips are 
configured in a daisy-chain mode, it is recommended to 
reduce the SCLK frequency. 
 
Reset Function 
There are 3 methods to reset the chip to default status, 
internal power-on reset (POR), software reset and hardware 
reset by nRESET pin. 
The internal POR circuit will reset the chip to default mode 
when the chip is initially powered up. The software reset is 
issued by software command (CFR bit D[0] is set to 0). The 
software command will be automatically cleared to 1 after the 
chip is reset. The hardware reset is issued by holding the 
nRESET pin low at least 10ns. If the hardware reset function 
is not used, this pin must be tied to VBD. 
If a reset function is performed, it will take the chip at least 
150μs to be ready to work. During this time, any operation will 
be corrupted.

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
A Typical Connection of SGM5202-14 
A typical data acquisition circuit for the SGM5202-14 is shown 
in Figure 18. 
 
Power Supply Recommendations 
The SGM5202-14 has analog power supply VA and digital 
interface power supply VBD. If the two power supplies are not 
from a single voltage source, it is recommended to power on 
VA firstly and then power on VBD. The supply voltage VBD 
should not be higher than the supply voltage VA. 
After the VA and VBD are powered on, it will take the chip at 
least 2ms to be ready to work. During this time, any operation 
will be corrupted.
