GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM41603 is an efficient 2:1 bidirectional 
switched-capacitor converter with integrated power 
switches. It can deliver 10A in forward direction (2:1 
voltage divider) and 5A in the reverse direction (1:2 
voltage doubler). This device allows using a 2S Li+ 
power source as a 1S Li+ solution by inserting it 
between the 2S battery pack and charger output, and 
saves the existing 1S power architecture that is 
powered from the same battery. 
This 2-phase high switching frequency (1.5MHz, MAX) 
and inductor-less topology allow low profile design with 
small footprint. The high switching frequency also 
reduces the size and quantity of the required capacitors. 
Safe operation is assured by over-voltage, under-voltage, 
over-current and thermal protections. Interference is 
also minimized by the built-in frequency dithering option. 
This device can achieve 98.5% efficiency which is the 
highest in its class. Thermal management of such a low 
loss device is simple, which makes it an ideal choice for 
industrial, consumer, and medical applications. 
The I2C interface allows flexible parameter settings 
including OCP, OVLO, switching frequency thresholds 
and soft-start currents and durations. The SGM41603 
is available in a Green WLCSP-2.85×2.59-42B 
package.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.
