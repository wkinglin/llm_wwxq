GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM8956XTDE8G is a dual, low power and high 
precision CMOS operational amplifier, which can 
operate from 1.8V to 5.5V single supply or from ±0.9V 
to ±2.75V dual power supplies, while consuming only 
20μA quiescent current per amplifier. The device 
supports rail-to-rail input and output operation. The 
input common mode voltage range is from (-VS) - 0.1V 
to (+VS) + 0.1V, and the output range is from (-VS) + 
0.014V to (+VS) - 0.014V. 
The SGM8956XTDE8G is designed to provide optimal 
performance in low voltage and low power systems. It 
has high impedance inputs and zero-drift 50μV (MAX) 
offset voltage. These specifications make the device 
appropriate for a wide range of applications requiring 
high precision, such as high linearity driver of high 
precision ADC. 
The SGM8956XTDE8G is available in a Green 
TDFN-2×2-8L package. It operates over an ambient 
temperature range of -40℃ to +125℃.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
Rail-to-Rail Input 
When SGM8956XTDE8G works at the power supply 
between 1.8V and 5.5V, the input common mode 
voltage range is from (-VS) - 0.1V to (+VS) + 0.1V. In 
Figure 1, the ESD diodes between the inputs and the 
power supply rails will clamp the input voltage not to 
exceed the rails. 
 
 
 
Figure 1. Input Equivalent Circuit 
 
Input Current-Limit Protection 
For ESD diode clamping protection, when the current 
flowing through ESD diode exceeds the maximum 
rating value, the ESD diode and amplifier will be 
damaged, so current-limit protection will be added in 
some applications. One resistor is selected to limit the 
current not to exceed the maximum rating value. In 
Figure 2, a series input resistor is used to limit the input 
current to less than 10mA, but the drawback of this 
current-limit resistor is that it contributes thermal noise 
at the amplifier input. If this resistor must be added, its 
value must be selected as small as possible. 
 
 
 
Figure 2. Input Current-Limit Protection 
 
Rail-to-Rail Output 
The SGM8956XTDE8G supports rail-to-rail output 
operation. In single power supply application, for 
example, when +VS = 5.5V, -VS = GND, 10kΩ load 
resistor is tied from OUT pin to VS/2, the typical output 
swing range is from 0.014V to 5.486V. 
 
Driving Capacitive Loads 
The SGM8956XTDE8G is unity-gain stable with heavy 
capacitive load. If greater capacitive load must be 
driven in application, the circuit in Figure 3 can be used. 
In this circuit, the IR drop voltage generated by RISO is 
compensated by feedback loop. 
 
 
 
Figure 3. Circuit to Drive Heavy Capacitive Load 
 
Power Supply Decoupling and Layout 
A clean and low noise power supply is very important in 
amplifier circuit design, besides of input signal noise, 
the power supply is one of important source of noise to 
the amplifier through +VS and -VS pins. Power supply 
bypassing is an effective method to clear up the noise 
at power supply, and the low impedance path to ground 
of decoupling capacitor will bypass the noise to GND. 
In application, 10μF ceramic capacitor paralleled with 
0.1μF or 0.01μF ceramic capacitor is used in Figure 4. 
The ceramic capacitors should be placed as close as 
possible to +VS and -VS power supply pins.

APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued) 
Grounding 
In low speed application, one node grounding technique 
is the simplest and most effective method to eliminate 
the noise generated by grounding. In high speed 
application, the general method to eliminate noise is to 
use a complete ground plane technique, and the whole 
ground plane will help distribute heat and reduce EMI 
noise pickup. 
 
Reduce Input-to-Output Coupling 
To reduce the input-to-output coupling, the input traces 
must be placed as far away from the power supply or 
output traces as possible. The sensitive trace must not 
be placed in parallel with the noisy trace in same layer. 
They must be placed perpendicularly in different layers 
to reduce the crosstalk. These PCB layout techniques 
will help to reduce unwanted positive feedback and 
noise. 
 
Typical Application Circuits 
Difference Amplifier 
The circuit in Figure 5 is a design example of classical 
difference amplifier. If R4/R3 = R2/R1, then VOUT = (VP - 
VN) × R2/R1 + VREF. 
 
 
 
Figure 5. Difference Amplifier 
 
High Input Impedance Difference Amplifier 
The circuit in Figure 6 is a design example of high input 
impedance difference amplifier, the added amplifiers at 
the input are used to increase the input impedance and 
eliminate drawback of low input impedance in Figure 5. 
 
 
 
Figure 6. High Input Impedance Difference Amplifier 
 
Active Low-Pass Filter 
The circuit in Figure 7 is a design example of active 
low-pass filter, the DC gain is equal to -R2/R1 and the 
-3dB corner frequency is equal to 1/2πR2C. In this 
design, the filter bandwidth must be less than the 
bandwidth of the amplifier, the resistor values must be 
selected as low as possible to reduce ringing or 
oscillation generated by the parasitic parameters in 
PCB layout.
