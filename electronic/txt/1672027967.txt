DECEMBER 2022 – REV. A 
GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM48510 is a high-speed low-side gate driver for 
MOSFET power switches. It provides large peak 
source and sink current capability with capacitive loads. 
The SGM48510 adopts separate output architecture. 
The separate output architecture allows independent 
control of the turn-on and turn-off speeds. An 8A peak 
current at the Miller plateau region improves the 
immunity of the device to the parasitic Miller conduction 
effect during switching transitions of the MOSFETs. 
The SGM48510 is available in Green TDFN-2×2-8AL 
and SOIC-8 packages.

NOTE: 
1. A 1μF load is connected from OUT (OUTH shorted to 
OUTL) to GND with 1kHz square wave input. 
OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
PCB Layout 
Proper PCB layout is an important design step in high 
current, fast switching circuits to provide proper device 
operation and design robustness. The SGM48510 gate 
driver integrates a short propagation delay and a 
powerful output stage, providing separate output 
architecture capable of delivering large current peaks 
with very fast rise time and fall time at the gate of the 
power switch. Very high di/dt can cause unacceptable 
ringing if trace length and impedance are not well 
controlled. The recommended layout guidelines are as 
follows in the design. 
• Place the driver device as close as possible to the 
power device to minimize the length of high-current 
traces between the driver output pins and the gate of 
the power switch device. 
• Place bypass capacitors between the VDD and GND 
pins as close as possible to the driver pins to 
minimize trace length and improve noise filtering. 
These capacitors support high peak current draw 
from VDD during power switch on. Low inductance 
surface mount components such as chip capacitors 
are strongly recommended. 
• Turn-on and turn-off current loop paths (driver 
devices, 
power 
switches, 
and 
VDD 
bypass 
capacitors) should be minimized to keep stray 
inductance to a minimum. 
• Wherever possible, parallel the source and return 
traces of a current loop, taking advantage of flux 
cancellation. 
• Separate power and signal traces, such as output 
and input signals. 
• Adding some gate resistors and/or snubbers can 
reduce switch node transients and ringing. These 
measures also reduce EMI. 
• Use a ground plane to provide noise shielding. Do 
not use the ground plane as the current carrying 
path for any current loop. In addition to noise 
shielding, the ground plane also helps reduce power 
dissipation. 
• Unused pins should be configured by referring to the 
pin description table to avoid output indeterminate 
states.
