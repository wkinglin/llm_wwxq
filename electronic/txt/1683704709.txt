GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM48524Q is a dual high-speed low-side gate 
driver for MOSFET and IGBT power switches. It has 
rail-to-rail driving capability and can sink and source up 
to 5A peak current with capacitive loads. The 
propagation delays are very short and well matched 
between the two channels that make the device very fit 
for applications that need accurate dual gate driving 
such 
as 
synchronous 
rectifiers. 
The 
matched 
propagation delays also allow for paralleling the two 
channels when higher driving current is required, such 
as for paralleled switches. The input voltage thresholds 
are fixed, independent of supply voltage (VDD) and are 
compatible with low voltage TTL and CMOS logic. 
Noise immunity is excellent due to the wide hysteresis 
window between the input low and high thresholds. The 
device has internal pull-up/pull-down resistors on the 
input pins to ensure low state on the driver output when 
the inputs are floating. 
The SGM48524Q is a dual non-inverting driver. It has 
independent enable pins (ENA and ENB) for each 
channel with active-high logic that can be left open for 
normal operation because of internal pull-up to VDD. 
The SGM48524Q is available in a Green SOIC-8 
package. It operates over a temperature range of -40℃ 
to +125℃. 
This device is AEC-Q100 qualified (Automotive 
Electronics Council (AEC) standard Q100 Grade 1) and 
it is suitable for automotive applications.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.
