GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM42501 device is a brushed DC motor driver. 
This device integrates four N-MOSFETs, which can 
supply up to 3.6A peak current at 40V voltage. 
The SGM42501 supports PH/EN interface. PWM signal 
can be implemented on the input interface to adjust 
motor speed. Customer can adjust PWM current limit or 
torque in real-time by VREF pin with a controller’s DAC 
output or PWM signal after RC filter. 
A number of protection features are provided in the 
device including over-current, short-circuit, under-voltage 
lockout and thermal shutdown. When the fault condition 
is removed, the device automatically resumes normal 
operation. 
The SGM42501 is available in a Green SOIC-8 
(Exposed Pad) package.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

The inputs can also be used for PWM control, for example, the speed of a DC motor.  
The PWM signal can be applied to EN or PH pin.  
If PWM signal is applied to EN pin, the PH pin is set to high or low to control the motor direction. When PH is high, 
the motor is running forward, and the decay mode is the slow decay. When PH is low, the motor is running reverse, 
and the decay mode is the fast decay.  
If PWM signal is applied to PH pin, the decay mode is fast decay and the EN pin needs to be set high to enable the 
output. When PWM duty cycle is from 50% to 100%, the motor is running forward. When PWM duty cycle is from 0% 
to 50%, the motor is running reverse.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
Device Operation 
The SGM42501 is typically used to drive a DC motor. 
An internal charge pump generates the necessary 
gate-drive voltage. The SGM42501 operates from 7V to 
40V motor power supply, which can supply a 3.6A peak 
current. Full protection features include over-current 
protection, under-voltage lockout and over-temperature 
protection. 
 
Standby Mode 
For SGM42501, the device will go to standby mode if 
EN/PH pins are low for longer than 1ms. If entering the 
standby mode, the output MOSFET, charge pump, and 
regulator are turned off for saving power. 
 
Internal PWM Current Control 
The current in the output is limited using fixed off-time 
control circuitry. If the motor current goes over the 
current limit setting, the two low-side MOSFETs are 
both turned on for tOFF time, slow decay mode is used 
to adjust the current. 
 
VREF 
The current limit is decided by VREF and RS together, 
please refer to Equation 1: 
REF
TRIPMAX
S
V
I
=10 R
×
                  (1) 
 
Over-Current Protection (OCP) 
Each MOSFET is protected by its own preset 
over-current limit. In case of an over-current (any 
direction), the whole bridge will be disabled (shutdown), 
and the device will retry after tRETRY. An over-current will 
occur due to a short between a switching node and 
ground, VM supply line, or the other node of the bridge 
(a winding short). 
 
Thermal Shutdown (TSD) 
The driver is shutdown if a junction over-temperature 
occurs in the device. Once the temperature goes back 
to the safe level, the device resumes its operation. 
 
Under-Voltage Lockout (UVLO) 
If the voltage on VM pin falls below its under-voltage 
lockout threshold, the device will be disabled. The 
device resumes operation when the power supply goes 
back above UVLO thresholds.

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
Sense Pin (LSS) 
If PWM current control is used, it is recommended to 
place a low-value resistor between the LSS and GND 
pins for current sensing. In order to detect the output 
current, the ground trace IR drop should be minimized. 
Surface mounted and low inductance sense resistor is 
recommended. It is necessary to consider the package, 
since I2 × R heat is generated in the sense resistor. And 
during PCB layout, place the resistor near to the motor 
driver as close as possible. 
Ensure that the maximum voltage of LSS (±500mV) is 
not exceeded at the maximum load, and select the 
appropriate resistance value. This rating may be 
exceeded for a short time during an over-current event. 
 
 
Ground and Layout Guidelines 
The power supply VM is suggested to be decoupled 
with a bulk capacitor in parallel with a lower value 
ceramic capacitor placed as close as practicable to the 
device.  
The exposed pad on the bottom of the device provides 
a path for heat dissipation. The pad should be soldered 
directly to an exposed surface on the PCB board to 
achieve better thermal performance. Thermal vias are 
also helpful to dissipate the heat. 
It is good to have a low impedance single-point ground, 
known as a star ground, which is located close to the 
SGM42501. The copper ground plane located under 
the device thermal pad is typically used as the star 
ground.
