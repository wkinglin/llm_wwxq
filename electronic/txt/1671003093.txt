GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM4576 is a 6-bit, non-inverting, bidirectional 
voltage-level translator which features two independent 
configurable power-supply lines. The A and B ports 
track the VCCA supply and VCCB supply respectively. The 
supply voltage range is 1.65V to 5.5V for A ports and 
2.3V to 5.5V for B ports. The device provides a 
bidirectional translation function between the different 
voltage nodes (including 1.8V, 2.5V, 3.3V and 5V). 
The SGM4576 has an output enable (OE) function, 
which controls the inputs and outputs states. When OE 
goes low, all I/Os enter into the high-impedance state. It is 
beneficial for reducing quiescent current consumption. 
When VCCA is powered, OE has an internal pull-down 
current source. 
The SGM4576 is available in Green TQFN-2.6×1.8-16L 
package. It operates over an ambient temperature 
range of -40℃ to +85℃.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice. 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.
