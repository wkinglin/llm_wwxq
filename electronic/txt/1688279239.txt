OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
The SGM8417A-1 is specifically designed to drive high 
current load. The device supports rail-to-rail input and 
output operation, and consumes low quiescent current. 
It can also provide a high slew rate. The combination of 
characteristics makes SGM8417A-1 suitable for LCD 
applications. 
 
Operating Voltage 
The SGM8417A-1 is guaranteed to operate from 4.5V 
to 24V, and the operation is extremely stable over the 
whole specified range of the temperature. The output 
voltage swing can be closer to the supply rail by 
reducing the load current. 
 
LCD Panel Application 
The SGM8417A-1 can provide optimal performance in 
LCD VCOM buffer. It features ±1.5A transient peak 
source/sink current. 
 
Output Current Limit 
The SGM8417A-1 can drive ±1.5A transient peak 
output current. The device has a ±1.5A (TYP) current 
limit, which is accomplished with the characteristics of the 
internal metal interconnects. Maximum reliability is 
maintained if the output continuous current never 
exceeds ±400mA. 
 
Short-Circuit Protection 
The output can be shorted to ±VS for 60 seconds and 
the supply-to-output differential voltage must be less 
than |12V|, else the SGM8417A-1 may be damaged. 
 
Thermal Consideration 
When operating the device, the users need to make 
sure that the junction temperature is below the absolute 
maximum one. The junction temperature is increasing 
because the power dissipation is higher than before. And 
a lot of possibilities can cause the thermal considerations, 
such as the width of trace in PCB, the package of the 
device, the gap between ambient and junction temperature 
and rate of environmental airflow. 
When the die temperature exceeds the threshold value 
of thermal shutdown, the output will be in high 
impedance state and it will remain in this state until the 
die temperature decreases to +120℃. 
The following equation indicates the calculation of power 
dissipation: 
PD(MAX) = (TJ(MAX) - TA)/θJA         (1) 
where: 
TJ(MAX) = Maximum junction temperature.  
TA = Ambient temperature. 
θJA = Junction to ambient thermal resistance. 
It is recommended that the junction temperature should 
not exceed +125℃ for normal operation. The parameter 
of ambient thermal resistance is determined by the 
width of trace in PCB layout. 
In addition, the ambient temperature and thermal 
resistance 
will affect the power dissipation 
of 
SGM8417A-1. 
 
Layout 
For the circuits with high power path, a good PCB 
design is essential. It is recommended to use the 
following layout method to improve the performance of 
SGM8417A-1 at most. 
 The power component should be close enough to 
SGM8417A-1 for better performance. Also, if the high 
current is necessary, the corresponding trace in PCB 
should be short and wide. 
 For some applications such as filtering, a series 
resistor is necessary to be added at the output of the 
device. 
 Choosing a suitable bypass capacitor can enhance 
the stability when driving the loads with high transient. 
For single-supply operation, the bypass capacitor 
should be placed as close to +VS pin as possible. For 
dual-supply operation, both +VS and -VS supplies 
should be bypassed to ground with separate 0.1μF 
ceramic capacitors. Using a 10μF tantalum capacitor is 
a good choice to improve the operating stability of the 
device when driving high transient load. 
 A 0.1μF capacitor should be connected with +IN pin 
to GND for better operation of SGM8417A-1 and the 
distance between this capacitor and +IN pin should be 
minimized. 
 It is recommended to connect exposed pad to -VS 
directly in the PCB.
