GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM2820 is a high efficiency, low EMI, filterless, 
Class-D audio amplifier with auto-recovering short-circuit 
protection. It operates from 2.5V to 5.5V supply voltage 
for 8Ω load. When powered with 5.0V supply voltage, 
the SGM2820 is capable of delivering 1.7W into an 8Ω 
load, with 10% THD+N. 
As a Class-D audio amplifier, the SGM2820 features 88% 
efficiency and 70dB PSRR at 217Hz which make the 
device ideal for battery-powered high-quality audio 
applications. 
A key benefit of the SGM2820 over typical Class-D 
audio power amplifiers is that it generates much less 
EMI emissions, thus greatly simplifying the system 
design for portable applications. The device includes 
the over-current and short-circuit protections with 
auto-recovery, which ensures the device can be 
operated safely and reliably without system interaction.

Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the

IMPORTANT APPLICATION NOTES 
1. As a Class-D power audio amplifier, the SGM2820 
requires adequate power supply decoupling to ensure 
its optimum performance such as output power, 
efficiency, and THD+N. Place decoupling capacitors as 
close to the VDD pin as possible. For the best power 
supply coupling, it is strongly recommended to add a 
100µF or greater capacitor placed near the audio 
power amplifier.  
2. It is recommended to employ a ground plane for 
SGM2820 on the system board. 
3. Use a simple ferrite bead filter for further EMI 
suppression. Choose a ferrite bead with a rated current 
which is no less than 2A or greater for applications with 
a load resistance less than 6Ω. Also, place the 
respective ferrite beard filters as close to the output 
pins, VOP and VON, as possible. 
4. For applications where the power supply is rated 
more than 4.5V, it is strongly recommended to add a 
simple snubber circuit (as shown in Figure 5) between 
the two output pins, VOP and VON, to prevent the 
device from accelerated deterioration or abrupt 
destruction due to excessive inductive flybacks that are 
induced on fast output switching or by an over-current 
or short-circuit condition.

As a Class-D power audio amplifier, the SGM2820 
features 88% high efficiency and 70dB PSRR at 217Hz 
which make the device ideal for battery-supplied, 
high-quality audio applications. A key benefit of the 
SGM2820 over typical Class-D audio power amplifiers 
is that it generates much less EMI emissions, thus 
greatly simplifying the system design for portable 
applications. The device includes the circuitry can 
minimize turn-on and turn-off transients (also known as 
pops-and-clicks) and auto-recovering over-current 
protection (OCP) and short-circuit protection (SCP). 
Furthermore, the SGM2820 includes under-voltage 
lockout to ensure proper operation when the device is 
first powered up, and thermal-overload protection to 
safeguard the die temperature during operation.  
Fully Differential Amplifier 
The SGM2820 is configured in a fully differential 
topology. The fully differential topology ensures that the 
amplifier outputs a differential voltage on the output that 
is equal to the differential input times the gain. The 
common-mode 
feedback 
ensures 
that 
the 
common-mode voltage at the output is biased around 
VDD/2 regardless of the common-mode voltage at the 
input. Although the fully differential topology of the 
SGM2820 can still be used with a single-ended input, it 
is highly recommended that the SGM2820 be used with 
differential inputs in a noisy environment, like a wireless 
handset, to ensure maximum noise rejection. 
Filterless Design 
Traditional Class-D amplifiers require an output filter. 
The filter adds cost and the size of the system board. 
Furthermore, it degrades the performance of power 
efficiency and THD+N. The SGM2820’s filterless 
modulation scheme does not require an output filter. 
Because the switching frequency of the SGM2820 is 
well beyond the bandwidth of most speakers, voice coil 
movement due to the switching frequency is very small. 
Use a speaker with a series inductance larger than 
10µH. An 8Ω speaker typically exhibits a series 
inductance in the range from 20µH to 100µH. 
However, LC filter is required when the trace between 
the SGM2820 and the speaker exceeds 100mm. Long 
trace acts like tiny antenna and generates EMI 
emissions which may result in FCC and CE certification 
failures. 
Low EMI Design 
Traditional Class-D amplifiers require the use of 
external LC filters or shielding to minimize EMI 
emissions. The SGM2820 employs a proprietary 
design of the amplifier output stage in conjunction with 
frequency 
jittering 
technique 
to 
minimize 
EMI 
emissions while maintaining high efficiency.  
How to Reduce EMI 
The SGM2820 does not require an LC output filter for 
short connections from the amplifier to the speaker. 
However, additional EMI suppressions can be made by 
use of a ferrite bead in conjunction with a capacitor, as 
shown in Figure 4. Choose a ferrite bead with low DC 
resistance (DCR) and high impedance (100Ω ~ 330Ω) 
at high frequencies (> 100MHz). The current flowing 
through the ferrite bead must be also taken into 
consideration. The effectiveness of ferrites can be 
greatly aggravated at much lower than the rated current 
values. Choose a ferrite bead with a rated current value 
no less than 2A. The capacitor value varies based on 
the chosen ferrite bead and the actual speaker lead 
length. Choose a capacitor less than 1nF based on EMI 
performance.

APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued) 
RC Snubber Circuit 
For applications where the power supply is rated more 
than 4.5V, it may become necessary to add an RC 
snubber circuit between the two output pins, VOP and 
VON, for robustness and reliability. Figure 5 shows a 
simple RC snubber circuit, which can be used to 
prevent the device from accelerated deterioration or 
abrupt destruction due to excessive inductive flybacks 
that are induced on fast output switching or by an 
over-current or short-circuit condition. 
 
Figure 5. RC Snubber Circuit 
Shutdown and Startup 
The SGM2820 employs the pin to minimize power 
consumption while it is not in use. When the pin is 
pulled to low, the SGM2820 is forced into shutdown 
mode, where all the analog circuitry is de-biased and 
the supply current is reduced to 0.1µA (TYP), and the 
differential outputs are individually pulled to ground 
through 2.2kΩ internal resistors. When the pin is 
asserted to high, the device exits out of shutdown mode 
and resumes normal operation after the startup time 
(tSTUP) of 35ms (TYP). 
Under-Voltage Lockout (UVLO) 
The SGM2820 incorporates circuitry designed to detect 
a low supply voltage. When the supply voltage drops 
below 2.0V (TYP), the SGM2820 goes into shutdown 
mode. The device will emerge out of the shutdown 
mode and resume its normal operation only when the 
supply voltage is restored to above 2.3V (TYP) and the 
SHDN  pin is pulled high. 
Auto-Recovering Over-Current Protection 
(OCP) & Short-Circuit Protection (SCP) 
Once an over-current or a short-circuit condition at the 
differential outputs is detected, either to the power 
supply or to ground or to each other, the SGM2820 
goes into shutdown mode. During shutdown, the 
SGM2820 activates auto-recovering process whose 
aim is to return the device to normal operation once the 
fault condition is removed. This process repeatedly 
examines if the fault condition persists, and returns the 
device to normal operation immediately after the fault 
condition is removed. This feature helps protect the 
device from large currents and maintain long-term 
reliability while removing the need for external system 
interaction to resume normal operation. 
Over-Temperature Shutdown (OTSD) 
The thermal-overload protection on the SGM2820 
prevents the device from being damaged when the die 
temperature exceeds +160℃. Once the die temperature 
exceeds the prescribed value, the device will be forced 
into shutdown mode and the outputs are disabled. Note 
that this is not a latched fault. Instead, the thermal fault 
will be cleared once the temperature of the die is 
lowered by 30℃. This large hysteresis will prevent it 
from generating motor boating sound and allow the 
device resume normal operation without the need for 
external system interaction. 
Pop-and-Click Suppression 
When asserting SHDN  pin from low to high level, the 
SGM2820 features a 35ms startup turn-on time to 
suppress the click-pop noise. For the best power-off 
pop performance, the amplifier should be placed in 
shutdown mode before removing the power supply 
voltage.

(1) 
In Equation 1, Gain is the desired voltage gain of the 
amplifier and RINE is expressed in kΩ. The matching of 
the input resistors is a crucial consideration for a fully 
differential amplifier. The balance of the differential 
outputs with respect to the common-mode voltage 
strongly depends on the matching of the input resistors. 
The CMRR, PSRR, and the cancellation of the 
even-order harmonics will be significantly degraded if 
the mismatch of the input resist occurs. Therefore, it is 
recommended to use the resistors with 1% tolerance or 
better to keep the performance optimized. Note that the 
matching tolerance of the input resistors is much more 
important than the absolute tolerance. Place the input 
resistors as close to the SGM2820 as possible to 
minimize the noise injected onto the high-impedance 
input nodes.  
Decoupling Capacitor (CS) 
The decoupling capacitor stabilizes the power supply 
voltage applied onto the SGM2820, thus improving its 
THD performance. It also prevents voltage ringing with 
a long lead. A capacitor of 1µF or greater with low 
equivalent-series-resistance (ESR) is required for 
decoupling and to be placed as close to the SGM2820 
as possible to minimize the resistance and inductance 
of the traces between the device and the capacitor. To 
filter out lower-frequency noise, a capacitor of 10µF or 
greater should be placed close to the SGM2820. 
Input Capacitors (CIN) 
The input capacitors and input resistors determine the 
corner frequency of the high-pass filter. The corner 
frequency (fC) is calculated with the Equation 2.

APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued) 
PCB Layout 
As the output power increases, the interconnect 
resistance (PCB traces and wires) among the audio 
amplifier, load, and power supply creates a voltage 
drop. The voltage loss on the traces between the 
SGM2820 and the load results in lower output power 
and lower efficiency. The higher trace resistance 
between the supply and the SGM2820 has the same 
effect as a poorly regulated supply, increasing the 
voltage ripples on the supply line and also reducing the 
peak output power. The effect of the residual trace 
resistance will be intensified as the output current 
increases. To maintain the highest output voltage swing 
for a maximum output power, the PCB traces that 
connect the output pins to the load and the supply pins 
to the power supply should be as wide and short as 
possible to minimize trace resistance. 
The use of power and ground planes will give the best 
THD+N performance. While reducing trace resistance, 
the use of power planes also creates parasite 
capacitors that help filter the power supply line. 
The inductive nature of the speakers can also result in 
overshoots on one or both edges, clamped by the 
parasitic diodes to ground and VDD in each case. From 
an EMI standpoint, this is the highly unfavorable 
waveform that will radiate or conduct to other 
components 
on 
the system board and cause 
interference. It is essential to keep the power and 
output traces short and well shielded if possible. Use of 
ground 
planes, 
beads, 
and 
micro-strip 
layout 
techniques are all useful in preventing unwanted 
interference. 
As the distance from the SGM2820 to the speaker 
increases, the amount of EMI radiation will increase 
since the output wires or traces acting as antenna 
become more efficient with their lengths. What is 
acceptable EMI is highly application specific. Ferrite 
bears placed close to the SGM2820 may be needed to 
reduce EMI radiation. The value of the ferrite bears is 
also application specific.
