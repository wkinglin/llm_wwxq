OCTOBER 2023 – REV. A 
GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM4551YXET is a 2-bit, SMbus, dual, bidirectional, I2C 
voltage translator with the ability of enable (EN) function. For 
VREF1, the typical operation range is from 1.2V to 3.3V and the 
typical operation for VREF2 is from 1.8V to 5.5V. 
The signal can be transmitted bilaterally from 1.2V to 5V. The 
propagation delay is significant small as the low on-resistance 
of SGM4551YXET. Also, if the EN pin is in high position, the 
voltage translator is transparent and then it allows the 
connection between SCL1 and SCL2, SDA1 and SDA2 
respectively. In addition, in this state, the transmitting 
direction is bidirectional. However, the transmitting will be 
suspended if the EN pin is in low state as the high-impedance 
property at this moment. 
For the applications, the connections of the devices and bus 
length are limited as the 400pF capacitance of the bus pin. 
However, SGM4551YXET allows the isolation between two 
sides of I2C bus so that more and more I2C devices can be 
added and connected with SGM4551YXET. 
Two different kinds of bus frequencies are supported by 
SGM4551YXET, one is 400kHz and the other is 100kHz. Also, 
if two frequencies for the buses are required, the priority of 
400kHz should be always higher than that of 100kHz. 
Because of the adding of the additional delay, the operational 
frequency of the device must be lower than 400kHz if the 
frequency of the master is equal to 400kHz. 
For the application of standard I2C, the pull-up resistor is 
required for the logic high levels, which means that the 
operation for I2C in this case is open-drain. Each side of the 
repeater requires a pull-up resistor and the value of resistor 
depends on the operation of SGM4551YXET. Also, when 
multiple masters are connected with SGM4551YXET, the 
standard operation current is 3mA, and high current can be 
taken into account under the specific conditions. 
The resistance between SDA1 and SDA2 is low when the 
state of them is low. However, if the state of SDA1 or SDA2 is 
high, the level of high position depends on the corresponding 
voltage reference. In the transparent mode, when the position 
of SDA1 is high, SDA2 must be pulled to a high level through 
the pull-up resistor. In addition, the transition for high and low 
voltage is seamless which can be selected by the users.  
Because of the same electrical characteristics for all the 
outputs of SGM4551YXET, so that the deviations of the 
propagation delay and voltage is extremely small. In addition, 
this advantage is good for the transition of discrete transistors 
as the symmetrical switch inside SGM4551YXET. On top of 
this, SGM4551YXET can also provide the protection of ESD 
for the devices with weak ESD ability. 
The SGM4551YXET is available in a Green XTDFN-1.35×1-8L 
package. It operates over an ambient temperature range of 
-40℃ to +85℃.

ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
General Applications of I2C 
Since the limitation of the load capacitance is 400pF, so that 
the 
number 
of 
devices 
which 
are 
connected 
to 
SGM4551YXET will be limited. Also, the advantage of 
SGM4551YXET is that it can isolate the buses of two sides, 
which means that more and more I2C devices can be 
connected with this device. 
Two different kinds of bus frequencies are supported by 
SGM4551YXET, one is 400kHz and the other is 100kHz. Also, 
if two frequencies for the buses are required, the priority of 
400kHz should be always higher than that of 100kHz. 
Because of the adding of the additional delay of the repeater, 
the operational frequency of the device must be lower than 
400kHz if the frequency of the master is equal to 400kHz. 
For the application of standard I2C, the pull-up resistor is 
required for the logic high levels, which means that the 
operation for I2C in this case is open-drain. Each side of the 
repeater requires a pull-up resistor and the value of resistors 
depend on the operation of SGM4551YXET. Also, when 
multiple masters are connected with SGM4551YXET, the 
standard operation current is 3mA, and high current can be 
taken into account under the specific conditions.

APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued) 
Bidirectional Translation 
For both directional applications, it is recommended to 
connect reference pins to VREF2. Also, both SCL and SDA 
pins should be pulled up by a resistor. A bypass capacitor 
should be added at the pin of VREF2 to improve the stability. 
Both the outputs of master and slave device can be push-pull 
or open-drain (a pull-up resistor is required at this case). In 
addition, if the users desire to use push-pull structure to 
generate 
the 
output, 
SGM4551YXET 
can 
operate 
unidirectional or be controlled by direction-control mechanism 
to prevent the risk of contentions. For open-drain output 
structure, it does not need any control mechanism for the 
transmitting direction. 
The pin of VREF1 should be tied to the VCC of processor 
directly. 
Sizing Pull-Up Resistor 
The function of pull-up resistor is used to limit the operation 
current to 15mA when the output is in high position, which 
means that the pass voltage will be around 350mV. The 
larger the current flowing to the pull-up resistor, the larger the 
pass voltage it is. To meet the requirement of 15mA, the 
pull-up resistor should be calculated as below:

Table 2 illustrates the corresponding value of pull-up resistor 
for different VREF and operation current. The +10% resistance 
value is recommended, as it ensures the pass voltage within 
350mV. In addition, if considering use a driver, please make 
sure that it has the ability to sink the total current of 
SGM4551YXET.

APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued) 
SGM4551YXET Bandwidth 
Different kinds of applications support different frequencies. 
Also, SGM4551YXET can operate for the conditions which 
the frequency is greater than 100MHz. The loading of the 
SGM4551YXET affects the maximum operation frequency. 
Also, the bandwidth of the SGM4551YXET is affected by the 
on-resistance and on-capacitance. 
The corner frequency (-3dB point) of SGM4551YXET is 
500MHz, which is measured in an analog way. However, for 
digital applications, the previous five harmonics of the input 
signal should never be degraded by the device, which means 
that the maximum bandwidth should be five times larger than 
the input digital signal. Also, the previous five harmonics are 
significant. Since the corner frequency of SGM4551YXET is 
around 500MHz, so that this device can support the digital 
signal with the frequency of 100MHz. 
There is no drive capability for SGM4551YXET so that the 
driver of the host should be strengthen enough for the 
condition of high frequency. If the output structure of the host 
device is push-pull, the pull-up resistor will not be taken into 
account, which can significantly decrease the length of trace. 
The maximum frequency harmonic (knee frequency: fknee) can 
be calculated by the following equations. For the input signal 
with fast rising or falling edge, like square waveform, the high 
frequency component is infinite. However, the knee frequency 
is used to determine the important frequency component, 
which means that if the frequency of harmonics is larger than 
this limitation, the users can assume that it will not influence 
the shape of the input signal. 
The equations to calculate fknee are shown as below: 
fknee = 0.5/RT(10% - 90%) 
fknee = 0.4/RT(20% - 80%) 
If the threshold of the input signal is determined by 10% to 
90%, the knee frequency can be defined as 0.5 divided by the 
rising time. If the threshold of the input signal is determined by 
20% to 80%, the knee frequency can be defined as 0.4 
divided by the rising time.  
The following suggestions should be accepted to improve the 
performance of SGM4551YXET: 
1. 
Minimize 
the 
distance 
between 
processor 
and 
SGM4551YXET as close as possible by minimizing the length 
of trace in PCB. 
2. The ringing and reflection can be improved by reducing the 
length of trace which is less than half the transmission time of 
the signal. 
3. A pull-up resistor should be taken into account to be added 
at 1.8V side for reducing the overshoot. Also, a falling edge 
with slow falling time is expected by the application of 
SGM4551YXET.
