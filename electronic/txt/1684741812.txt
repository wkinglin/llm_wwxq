GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM66057 is an internally compensated, 2.2MHz 
switching frequency, current mode, synchronous Boost 
switching converter. The output voltage is fixed at 5.25V. 
The device turns into power-save mode to maintain 
high efficiency at light load currents. Its output is 
disconnected by the rectifier circuit during shutdown, 
with no input to output leakage. 
Various protection features such as over-current, 
short-circuit and over-temperature are implemented to 
protect the device from various fault conditions. 
The SGM66057 is available in a Green WLCSP- 
1.26×1.21-9B package.

ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
The SGM66057 is a fully-integrated synchronous Boost 
DC/DC converter. The recommended input supply 
voltage for full performance is 2.7V to 4.85V. Operating 
input voltage above 4.85V is possible with SGM66057, 
however, the full performance is not guaranteed 
beyond the 4.85V operation. When the input supply 
voltage is larger than 5.3V, the device is shut down. An 
inductor, an output storage capacitor and an input 
decoupling capacitor should be selected to ensure the 
proper performance desired in a specific application 
circuit. 
 
Start-up and Enable 
The SGM66057 implements the enable input to control 
the turn-on and turn-off of the device. A logic signal 
above 1.3V applied on EN pin turns on the device, and 
a logic signal below 0.4V turns off the device. 
 
The SGM66057 has built-in 500μs (TYP) soft-start time. 
After enabling, the SGM66057 enters linear pre-charge 
phase with a limited current of 200mA. As the output 
voltage reaches the input voltage, the pre-charge 
phase terminates. The SGM66057 starts switching and 
boosts the output voltage to the 5.25V fixed output. 
This start-up sequence effectively reduces the inrush 
current during start-up. 
 
The SGM66057 has a built-in 0.1µA (TYP) pull-down 
current when the EN pin is programmed to logic low. In 
addition to this pull-down current, there is an additional 
300kΩ pull-down resistor when EN pin is logic low. 
When EN pin is programmed to logic high, the 300kΩ 
pull-down resistor is switched off and only the 0.1µA 
(TYP) pull-down current remains. 
 
Current Limit and Short-Circuit 
The SGM66057 has a built-in 3.4A (TYP) current limit. 
When inductor current exceeds the valley current limit, 
output voltage will fall to maintain a constant power 
operation. As output voltage drops below the input 
voltage, current limit is reduced to 200mA (TYP) to 
minimize excessive power dissipation within the IC. 
 
When an output short to ground event occurs, the 
SGM66057 reduces the current limit to 200mA (TYP) to 
prevent damage to the device. The SGM66057 
resumes operation and goes through the start-up 
sequence once the short-circuit condition is removed. 
 
Inductor Selection 
Inductor is an essential element for current DC/DC 
switch mode power supplies regardless of topology. 
Inductor serves as the energy storage element for 
power conversion. Inductance and saturation current of 
inductor are two most important criterions for inductor 
selection. For general design guidance, the selected 
inductance should provide a peak to peak ripple current 
that is around 30% of the average inductor current at 
full load and nominal input voltage. The average 
inductor current for a Boost converter is the input 
current. Equation 1 shows the calculation of inductance 
selection, where fSW is the switching frequency and ΔIL 
is the inductor ripple current.

(1) 
The 3.4A (TYP) valley current limit and the inductor 
current ripple should be considered when selecting the 
saturation current of the inductor. 
The inductor also affects the close loop response of the 
DC/DC converter. The SGM66057 is an internally 
compensated device, and the loop response is 
optimized for inductor in the range of 0.33µH to 1.3µH. 
 
Input Capacitor 
Boost converter’s input capacitor has continuous 
current throughout the entire switching cycle, a 10µF 
ceramic capacitor is recommended to place as close as 
possible between the VIN pin and GND pin of the 
device. For applications where the SGM66057 is 
located far away from the input source, a 47µF or 
higher capacitance capacitor is recommended to damp 
the wiring harness inductance.

Output Capacitor 
The output capacitors of Boost converter dictate the 
output voltage ripple and load transient response. 
Equation 2 is used to estimate the necessary 
capacitance to achieve desired output voltage ripple, 
where ΔV is the maximum allowed ripple.

(2) 
Since SGM66057 is an internally compensated device, 
the loop response is optimized for capacitor in the 
range of 10µF to 47µF. Due to the DC bias nature of 
ceramic capacitors, care should be taken by verifying 
manufacturer’s datasheet to ensure enough effective 
capacitance at desired output voltage. 
Layout Considerations 
In addition to component selection, layout is a critical 
step to ensure the performance of any switch mode 
power supplies. Poor layout could result in system 
instability, EMI failure, and device damage. Thus, place 
the inductor, input and output capacitors as close to the 
IC as possible, and use wide and short traces for 
current carrying traces to minimize PCB inductance. 
For Boost converter, the current loop of the output 
capacitor from VOUT pin back to the PGND pin of the 
device should be as small as possible.
