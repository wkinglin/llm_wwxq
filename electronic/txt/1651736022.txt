GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM8543 (single with shutdown) is a low cost, 
voltage feedback amplifier. The device can operate 
from 2.1V to 5.5V single supply, while consuming only 
48μA quiescent current. It provides rail-to-rail input with 
a wide input common mode voltage range and 
rail-to-rail output voltage swing. This feature makes 
SGM8543 appropriate for buffering ASIC. 
The SGM8543 offers a gain-bandwidth product of 
1.1MHz and an ultra-low input bias current of 0.5pA. It 
is well suited for piezoelectric sensors, integrators and 
photodiode amplifiers. 
The SGM8543 is designed into a wide range of 
applications, such as battery-powered instrumentation, 
safety monitoring, portable systems, and transducer 
interface circuits in low power systems. 
The SGM8543 is available in Green SOIC-8 and 
SOT-23-6 packages. It is specified over the extended 
-40℃ to +125℃ temperature range.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
Rail-to-Rail Input 
When SGM8543 works at the power supply between 
2.1V and 5.5V, the input common mode voltage range 
is from (-VS) - 0.1V to (+VS) + 0.1V. In Figure 1, the ESD 
diodes between the inputs and the power supply rails 
will clamp the input voltage not to exceed the rails.

Rail-to-Rail Output 
The SGM8543 supports rail-to-rail output operation. In 
single power supply application, for example, when +VS 
= 5V, -VS = GND, 100kΩ load resistor is tied from OUT 
pin to VS/2, the typical output swing range is from 
0.005V to 4.997V. 
 
Driving Capacitive Loads 
The SGM8543 is designed for unity-gain stable for 
capacitive load up to 250pF. If greater capacitive load 
must be driven in application, the circuit in Figure 2 can 
be used. In this circuit, the IR drop voltage generated 
by RISO is compensated by feedback loop.

Power Supply Decoupling and Layout 
A clean and low noise power supply is very important in 
amplifier circuit design, besides of input signal noise, 
the power supply is one of important source of noise to 
the amplifier through +VS and -VS pins. Power supply 
bypassing is an effective method to clear up the noise 
at power supply, and the low impedance path to ground 
of decoupling capacitor will bypass the noise to GND. 
In application, 10μF ceramic capacitor paralleled with 
0.1μF or 0.01μF ceramic capacitor is used in Figure 3. 
The ceramic capacitors should be placed as close as 
possible to +VS and -VS power supply pins.

low-pass filter, the DC gain is equal to -R2/R1 and the 
-3dB corner frequency is equal to 1/2πR2C. In this 
design, the filter bandwidth must be less than the 
bandwidth of the amplifier, the resistor values must be 
selected as low as possible to reduce ringing or

PCB layout.
