OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

FUNCTIONAL BLOCK DIAGRAM 
For the open-drain output (refer to Figure 2), the 
detection and release voltages are used as threshold 
voltages. When the voltage applied to the VCC pin 
reaches the appropriate threshold voltage, the VOUT 
pin voltage switches from either high to low or from low 
to high (with external pull-up). Please refer to the Figure 
4 for information on hysteresis. 
Since the SGM813B uses an open-drain output, it is 
necessary to connect a pull-up resistor to VCC or 
another power supply. The high level of output voltage 
(VOUT) in this case will be the voltage that the pull-up 
resister is connected to.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
Basic Operation: NMOS Output (Active Low) 
When VCC is higher than the release voltage (VDET + 
VHYS), the output is high and the N1 (NMOS transistor) 
in Figure 3 is turned off. Then the voltage to the 
comparator input is

C

R
 
When the power supply is powered down or when there 
is a power supply fluctuation, the output goes low if VCC 
drops below the detection voltage (VDET). Meanwhile, 
the N1 (NMOS transistor) in Figure 3 is turned on. Then 
the voltage to the comparator input is changed to  
×
+

CC

V

R  
Once VCC goes below the minimum operating voltage, 
the output becomes undefined, or rises to VCC when the 
output is pulled up to VCC. 
The output becomes low when VCC rises above the 
minimum operating voltage. The output still remains 
low even when VCC surpasses the detection voltage 
(VDET), as long as it does not exceed the release 
voltage (VDET + VHYS). 
When VCC rises above the release voltage (point B in 
Figure 4), the NMOS transistor is turned off to allow the 
output to be pulled up to VCC after tD. 
Delay Circuit 
When VCC is powered up and exceeds the release 
voltage (VDET + VHYS), the output signal changes from 
low to high with a delay time tD due to the delay circuit. 
The delay time (tD) is measured from when input 
voltage at the VCC pin exceeds the release voltage 
(VDET + VHYS) to the time at which the output voltage of 
the VOUT pin inverts. 
The output signal is not delayed when VCC falls below 
the detection voltage (point A in Figure 4). The delay 
time (tD) is a fixed 22ms (TYP), and it is determined by 
a built-in oscillation circuit and a built-in counter.

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
1. When a resistor is connected between the input 
and the VCC pin, since the IC’s supply current flows 
through the VCC pin, detection voltage and release 
voltage will increase.

2. Do not apply an electrostatic discharge to this IC 
that exceeds the performance ratings of the built-in 
electrostatic protection circuit. 
3. Ensure that rise and fall times of VCC pin’s input 
are more than several microseconds per volt. 
Otherwise the IC’s operation is not stable. 
 
Power Supply Recommendations 
The device is designed to operate with input supplies 
from 1V to 6V. An input supply capacitor is 
recommended between the VCC pin and GND pin. If 
the voltage supply that provides power to VCC is 
susceptible to any large voltage transient that can 
exceed VCC maximum, the user must take additional 
precautions.
