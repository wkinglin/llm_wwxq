GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM4570Q is a 4-bit, dual-supply translating 
transceiver. The auto direction sensing function allows a 
bidirectional voltage level translation for the device. The 
nA and nB are 4-bit data input-output ports and OE is 
an output enable input. VCCA and VCCB are two supply 
pins that accept the voltage from 1.65V to 3.6V and 
2.3V to 5.5V respectively. This makes the translation 
among voltage nodes of 1.8V, 2.5V, 3.3V and 5V. OE 
and nA pins track the VCCA supply, and nB pins track 
the VCCB supply. When OE pin is held low, the outputs 
enter a high-impedance off-state. 
This 
device 
is 
AEC-Q100 
qualified 
(Automotive 
Electronics Council Standard Q100 Grade 1) and the 
use of this device is suitable for automotive applications.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
1. Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may 
affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
2. The minimum input and output voltage ratings may be 
exceeded if the input and output clamp current ratings are 
observed. 
3. The performance capability of a high-performance integrated 
circuit in conjunction with its thermal environment can create 
junction temperatures which are detrimental to reliability. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.
