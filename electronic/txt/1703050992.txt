GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The 
SGM41513/SGM41513A/SGM41513D 
are 
battery 
chargers and system power path management devices with 
integrated converter and power switches for using with 
single-cell Li-Ion or Li-polymer batteries. This highly 
integrated 3A device is capable of fast charging and supports 
a wide input voltage range suitable for smart phones, tablets 
and portable systems. I2C programming makes it a very 
flexible powering and charger design solution. 
The devices include four main power switches: input reverse 
blocking FET (RBFET, Q1), high-side switching FET for Buck 
or Boost mode (HSFET, Q2), low-side switching FET for Buck 
or Boost mode (LSFET, Q3) and battery FET that controls the 
interconnection of the system and battery (BATFET, Q4). The 
bootstrap diode for the high-side gate driving is also 
integrated. The internal power path has a very low impedance 
that reduces the charging time and maximizes the battery 
discharge efficiency. Moreover, the input voltage and current 
regulations provide maximum charging power delivery to the 
battery with various types of input sources. 
A wide range of input sources are supported, including 
standard USB hosts, charging ports and USB compliant high 
voltage adaptors. The default input current limit is 
automatically selected based on the built-in USB interface. 
This limit is determined by the detection circuit in the system 
(e.g. USB PHY). The SGM41513/SGM41513A/SGM41513D 
are USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 power specifications compliant with 
input current and voltage regulation. It also meets USB 
On-The-Go (OTG) power rating specification and is capable 
of boosting the battery voltage to supply 5.15V on VBUS with 
1.2A (or 0.5A) current limit. 
The system voltage is regulated slightly above the battery 
voltage by the power path management circuit and is kept 
above the programmable minimum system voltage (3.5V by 
default). Therefore, system power is maintained even if the 
battery is completely depleted or removed. Dynamic power 
management 
(DPM) 
feature 
is 
also 
included 
that 
automatically reduces the charge current if the input current 
or voltage limit is reached. If the system load continues to 
increase after reduction of charge current down to zero, the 
power path management provides the deficit from battery by 
discharging battery to the system until the system power 
demand is fulfilled. This is called supplement mode, which 
prevents the input source from overloading. 
Starting and termination of a charging cycle can be 
accomplished without software control. The sensed battery 
voltage is used to decide for starting phase of charging in one 
of the three phases of charging cycle: pre-conditioning, 
constant current or constant voltage. When the charge 
current falls below a preset limit and the battery voltage is 
above recharge threshold, the charger function will 
automatically terminate and end the charging cycle. If the 
voltage of a charged battery falls below the recharge 
threshold, the charger begins another charging cycle. 
Several safety features are provided in the SGM41513/ 
SGM41513A/SGM41513D 
such 
as 
over-voltage 
and 
over-current protections, battery temperature monitoring, 
charging safety timing, thermal shutdown and input UVLO. 
TS pin is connected to an NTC thermistor for battery 
temperature monitoring and protection in both charge and 
Boost modes according to JEITA profile. This device also 
features thermal regulation in which the charge current is 
reduced, if the junction temperature exceeds 80℃ or 120℃ 
(selectable).  
Charging status is reported by the STAT output and 
fault/status bits. A negative pulse is sent to the nINT output 
pin as soon as a fault occurs to notify the host. BATFET reset 
control is provided by nQON pin to exit ship mode or for a full 
system reset. 
The SGM41513/SGM41513A/SGM41513D are available in a 
Green TQFN-4×4-24L package.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
The 
SGM41513/SGM41513A/SGM41513D 
are 
power 
management and charger devices for applications such as 
cell phones, tablets and wearables that use high capacity 
single-cell Li-Ion or Li-polymer batteries. The SGM41513/ 
SGM41513A/SGM41513D can accommodate a wide range 
of input sources including USB, wall adaptor and car chargers. 
It is optimized for 5V input (USB voltage) but is capable of 
operating with input voltages from 3.9V to 13.5V. It also 
supports JEITA profile for battery charging safety at high or 
low temperatures. Automatic power path selection to power 
the system (SYS) from the input source (VBUS), battery (BAT) 
or both is another feature of the device. Battery charge 
current is programmable and can reach a maximum of 3A 
(charge). In the Boost mode, the battery voltage is boosted to 
power the VBUS pin (1.2A MAX) when it is a power receiving 
node (USB OTG) that is typically regulated to 5.15V. 
The device may operate in several different modes: 
In HIZ mode, the reverse blocking FET (Q1), internal REGN 
LDO, converter switches and some other parts of the internal 
circuit remain off to save the battery while it supplies DC 
power to the system through BATFET. 
In the sleep mode, the switching is stopped. The charger 
goes to the sleep mode when the input source voltage (VVAC) 
is not high enough for charging the battery. In other words, 
VVAC is smaller than VBAT + VSLEEP (where VSLEEP is a small 
threshold) and Buck converter is not able to charge, even at 
its maximum duty cycle. The Boost may also go to the sleep 
mode if similar issue happens in the reverse direction (when 
VVAC is almost equal to or smaller than VBAT). 
In supplement mode, the input source power is not enough to 
supply system demanded power and the battery assists by 
discharging to the system in parallel and providing the deficit. 
 
Power-On Reset (POR) 
The internal circuit of the device is powered from the greater 
voltage between VVBUS and VBAT. When the voltage of the 
selected source goes above its UVLO level (VVBUS > 
VVAC_UVLOZ or VBAT > VBAT_UVLOZ), a POR happens and 
activates the sleep comparator, battery depletion comparator 
and BATFET driver. Upon activation, the I2C interface will 
also be ready for communication and all registers reset to 
their default values. 
 
Power-Up from Battery Only (No Input 
Source) 
When only the battery is presented as a source and its 
voltage is above depletion threshold (VBAT_DPL_RISE), the 
BATFET turns on and connects the battery to the system. 
The quiescent current is minimum because the REGN LDO 
remains off. Conduction losses are also low due to small 
RDSON of BATFET. Low losses help to extend the battery run 
time.  
The discharge current through BATFET is continuously 
monitored. In the supplement mode, if a system overload (or 
short) occurs (IBAT > IBATFET_OCP), the BATFET is turned off 
immediately and BATFET_DIS bit is set to 1. The BATFET 
will not enable until the input source is applied or one of the 
BATFET Enable Mode (Exit Ship Mode) methods (explained 
later) is used to activate the BATFET. 
 
Power-Up Process from the Input Power 
Source 
Upon connection of an input source (VBUS), its voltage 
sensed from VAC pin is checked to turn on the internal REGN 
LDO regulator and the bias circuits (whether the battery is 
present or not). The input current limit is determined and set 
before the Buck converter is started. The sequences of 
actions when VBUS as input source is powered up are: 
1. REGN LDO power-up. 
2. Poor power source detection (qualification). 
3. Input power source type detection. (Based on D+/D- or 
PSEL input. It is used to set the default input current limit 
(IINDPM[4:0]).) 
4. Setting of the input voltage limit threshold (VINDPM 
threshold). 
5. DC/DC converter power-up. 
 
Details of the power-up steps are explained in the following 
sections.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
REGN LDO Power-Up 
The REGN low dropout regulator powers the internal bias 
circuits, HSFET and LSFET gate drivers and TS rail 
(thermistor pin). The STAT pin can also be pulled up to REGN. 
The REGN enables when the following 2 conditions are 
satisfied and remain valid for a 220ms delay time, otherwise 
the device stays in high impedance mode (HIZ) with REGN 
LDO off. 
1. VVAC > VVAC_PRESENT. 
2. VVAC > VBAT + VSLEEPZ (in Buck mode) or VVBUS < VBAT + 
VSLEEP (in Boost mode). 
In HIZ state, the quiescent current drawn from VBUS is very 
small (less than IVBUS_HIZ). System is powered only by the 
battery in HIZ mode. 
 
Poor Power Source Detection (Qualification) 
When REGN LDO is powered, the input source (adaptor) is 
checked for its type and current capacity. To start the Buck 
converter, the input (VBUS) must meet the following 
conditions: 
1. VVBUS < VVAC_OV. 
2. VVBUS > VVBUSMIN_RISE during tBAD_SRC test period (30ms TYP) 
in which the IBAD_SRC (30mA TYP) current is pulled from 
VBUS. 
If the test is failed, the conditions are repeatedly checked 
every two seconds. As soon as the input source passes 
qualification, the VBUS_GD bit in status register is set to 1 
and a pulse is sent to the nINT pin to inform the host. Type 
detection will start as next step. 
 
Input Power Source Type Detection 
The input source detection will run through the D+/D- lines or 
the PSEL pin while REGN LDO is powered and after the 
VBUS_GD bit is set. The SGM41513D can detect the input 
source types which include SDP/DCP and non-standard 
adaptor 
through 
D+/D- 
pins 
following 
USB 
BC1.2 
specification. The SGM41513 sets the input current limit 
through PSEL pin. A pulse is sent to nINT pin to inform the 
host when the input source type detection is completed. 
Some registers and pins are also updated as detailed below: 
1. Input current limit register (the value in the IINDPM[4:0]) is 
changed to set current limit. 
2. PG_STAT (power good) bit is set. 
3. VBUS_STAT[2:0] register is updated to indicate USB or 
adaptor input source types. 
The input current is always limited by the IINDPM[4:0] register 
and the limit can be updated by the host if needed. 
 
Input Current Limit by PSEL (SGM41513) 
PSEL pin interfaces with USB physical layer (PHY) for input 
current limit setting. The USB PHY device output is used to 
detect if the input is a USB host or a charging port. In the 
host-control mode, the host must enable IINDET_EN bit for 
reading the PSEL value and updating the IINDPM[4:0]. In the 
default mode, IINDPM[4:0] is updated automatically by PSEL 
value in real-time as given in Table 1.

Input Current Limit by D+/D- Detection 
(SGM41513A/SGM41513D) 
The SGM41513A/SGM41513D integrate a D+/D- based input 
source detection to set the input current limit when VBUS is 
plug-in. When input source is plugged in, the SGM41513A/ 
SGM41513D start USB BC1.2 detection and set the 
SDP/DCP related input current limit. And if the data contact 
detection timer expires, the non-standard adaptor detection 
starts and then sets the input current limit. Please refer to 
Table 2 and Table 3. 
 
Force Detection of Input Current Limit  
The host can set IINDET_EN bit to 1 in host mode to force the 
device to run. And the IINDET_EN bit returns to 0 by itself and 
input result is updated after the detection is completed.

D+/D- Output Voltage Setting (SGM41513A/SGM41513D) 
The host can set D+/D- output voltages by DP_VSET[1:0] 
and DM_VSET[1:0] to HIZ, 0V, 0.6V or 3.3V. When BC1.2 
detection runs, these bits are ignored. 
 
Setting of the Input Voltage Limit Threshold 
(VINDPM Threshold) 
A wide voltage range (3.9V to 5.4V, 5.9V to 9V, 10.5V to 12V) 
is supported for the input voltage limit setting in VINDPM[3:0] 
and VINDPM_OS[1:0]. 4.5V is the default for USB. 
The device supports dynamic tracking of the battery voltage 
(VINDPM). VDPM_BAT_TRACK[1:0] bits can be used to 
enable  tracking (00 to disable tracking) and set the tracking 
offset value. When the tracking is enabled, the input voltage 
limit will be set to the larger value between the VINDPM[3:0] and 
VBAT + VDPM_BAT_TRACK[1:0]. The VDPM_BAT_TRACK[1:0] 
tracking offset can be set to 200mV, 250mV or 300mV. And 
this function only takes effect when VINDPM_OS[1:0] = 00. 
 
DC/DC Converter Power-Up 
The 1.5MHz switching converter composed of LSFET and 
HSFET is enabled, which can start switching when the input 
current limit is set. Converter is initiated with a soft-start when 
the system voltage is ramped up. If SYS voltage is less than 
2.2V, the input current is limited to 200mA or IINDPM[4:0], 
depending on whichever is smaller, otherwise the limit is set 
to IINDPM[4:0]. 
The BATFET remains on to charge the battery if the battery 
charging function is enabled, otherwise BATFET turns off. 
When converter operates for battery charging, it acts as an 
efficient, fixed frequency synchronous Buck converter 
regardless of the input/output voltages and currents. However, 
it is capable of switching to PFM mode at light load when 
charging is disabled or when the detected battery voltage is 
less than minimum system voltage setting. PFM operation 
can be enabled or prevented in either Buck or Boost mode 
through using the PFM_DIS bit. 
 
Boost Mode 
The SGM41513/SGM41513A/SGM41513D support USB 
On-The-Go. When a load device is connected to the USB port, 
the converter can operate as a step-up synchronous 
converter (Boost mode) with 1.5MHz switching frequency to 
supply power from the battery to that load. The 500mA USB 
OTG output current limit requirement is achieved by 
programming, however, the Boost converter can deliver 1.2A 
to the output (default limit). Converter will be set to Boost 
mode if at least 30ms is passed from enabling this mode 
(OTG_CONFIG bit = 1) and the following conditions are 
satisfied: 
1. VBAT > VBATLOW_OTG. 
2. VVBUS < VBAT + VSLEEP (in sleep mode). 
3. Acceptable voltage range at TS pin (VBHOT < VTS < VBCOLD). 
The output voltage is set to VVBUS = 5.15V and is maintained 
as long as VBAT is above VBATLOW_OTG. The output current can 
reach up to the programmed value by BOOST_LIM bit (0.5A 
or 1.2A). The VBUS_STAT[2:0] status register bits are set to 
111 in Boost mode (OTG). 
To minimize the output overshoot in Boost mode, the device 
starts with PFM first and then switches to PWM. As stated 
before, PFM can be avoided by using PFM_DIS bit in Buck 
and Boost modes.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Host Mode and Default Mode Operation with 
Watchdog Timer 
After a power-on reset, the device starts in default mode 
(standalone) with all registers reset as default. If the 
watchdog timer is expired, the device will also enter default 
mode with WATCHDOG_FAULT bit set to high. When the 
host is in sleep mode or there is no host, the device stays in 
the default mode in which the SGM41513/SGM41513A/ 
SGM41513D operate like an autonomous charger. The 
battery is charged for 16 hours (default value for the fast 
charging safety timer). Then the charge stops while Buck 
converter continues to operate to power the system load. 
Most of the flexibility features of the SGM41513/SGM41513A/ 
SGM41513D become available in the host mode when the 
device is controlled by a host with I2C. By setting the 
WD_RST bit to 1, the charger mode changes from default 
mode to host mode. In this mode, the WATCHDOG_FAULT 
bit is low and all device parameters can be programmed by 
the host. To prevent the device watchdog from reset that 
results in going back to default mode, the host must disable 
the watchdog timer by setting WATCHDOG[1:0] = 00, or it must 
consistently reset the watchdog timer before expiry by writing 1 
to WD_RST to prevent WATCHDOG_FAULT bit from being set. 
Every time a 1 is written to the WD_RST, the watchdog timer 
will restart counting. Therefore, it should be reset again before 
overflow (expiry) to keep the device in the host mode. If the 
watchdog timer expires (WATCHDOG_FAULT bit = 1), the 
device returns to default mode and all registers are reset to 
their default values except for IINDPM[4:0], VINDPM[3:0], 
VINDPM_OS[1:0], BATFET_DLY and BATFET_DIS bits that 
keep their values unchanged. 
 
Battery Charging Management 
The SGM41513/SGM41513A/SGM41513D are designed for 
charging single-cell Li-Ion or Li-poly batteries with a charge 
current up to 3A (MAX). The battery connection switch 
(BATFET) is in the charge or discharge current path and 
features low on-resistance (26mΩ) to allow high efficiency 
and low voltage drop. 
 
Charging Cycle in Autonomous Mode 
Charging is enabled if CHG_CONFIG = 1 and nCE pin is 
pulled low. In default mode, the SGM41513/SGM41513A/ 
SGM41513D run a charge cycle with the default parameters 
itemized in Table 4. At any moment, the device can be 
controlled by changing to the host mode.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Start a New Charging Cycle 
If the converter can start switching and all the following 
conditions are satisfied, a new charge cycle starts: 
• NTC temperature fault is not asserted (TS pin). 
• Safety timer fault is not asserted. 
• BATFET is not forced off. (BATFET_DIS bit = 0). 
• Charging enabled (3 conditions: CHG_CONFIG bit = 1, 
ICHG[5:0] register is not 0mA and nCE pin is low). 
• Battery voltage is below the programmed full charge level 
(VREG). 
A new charge cycle starts automatically if battery voltage falls 
below the recharge threshold level (VREG - 100mV or VREG - 
200mV configured by VRECHG bit). Also, if the charge cycle 
is completed, a new charging cycle can be initiated by 
toggling of the nCE pin or CHG_CONFIG bit. 
Normally, a charge cycle terminates when the charge voltage 
is above the recharge threshold level and the charging 
current falls below the termination threshold if the device is 
not in thermal regulation or dynamic power management 
(DPM) mode. 
 
Charge Status Report 
STAT is an open-drain output pin that reports the status of 
charge and can drive an LED for indication: a low indicates 
that charging is in progress, a high shows that charging is 
completed or disabled and alternating low/high (blinking) 
show a charging fault. The STAT may be disabled (keep the 
open-drain switch off) by setting EN_ICHG_MON[1:0] = 10 or 
11. 
The CHRG_STAT[1:0] status register reports the present 
charging phase and status by two bits: 00 = charging disabled, 
01 = in pre-charge, 10 = in fast charging (constant current mode 
or constant voltage mode) and 11 = charging completed. 
A negative pulse is sent on nINT pin to inform the host when a 
charging cycle is completed. 
In addition, the output status of STAT pin can be set by 
STAT_SET[1:0] bits, 00 = LED off (HIZ), 01 = LED on (low), 
10 = LED blinking at 1s on 1s off, 11 = LED blinking at 1s on 
3s 
off. 
This 
two 
bits 
only 
take 
effect 
when 
EN_ICHG_MON[1:0] = 01. 
 
Battery Charging Profile 
The 
SGM41513/SGM41513A/SGM41513D 
feature 
full 
battery charging profile with five phases. In the beginning of 
the cycle, the battery voltage (VBAT) is tested, and appropriate 
current and voltage regulation levels are selected as shown in 
Table 5. Depending on the detected status of the battery, the 
proper phase is selected to start or for continuation of the 
charging cycle. The phases are trickle charge (VBAT < 2.2V), 
pre-charge, fast-charge (constant current and constant 
voltage) and optional top-off trickle charge.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Charge Termination 
A charge cycle is terminated when the battery voltage is 
higher than the recharge threshold and the charge current 
falls below the programmed termination current. Unless there 
is a high power demand for system and it needs to operate in 
supplement mode, the BATFET turns off at the end of the 
charge cycle. Even after termination, the Buck converter 
operates continuously to supply the system. 
CHRG_STAT[1:0] bits are set to 11 and a negative pulse is 
sent to nINT pin after termination.  
If the charger is regulating input current, input voltage or 
junction temperature instead of charge current, termination 
will be temporarily prevented. EN_TERM bit is termination 
control bit and can be set to 0 to disable termination before it 
happens. 
At low termination currents (60mA TYP), the offset in the 
internal comparator may give rise to a higher (+10mA to 
+20mA) actual termination current. A delay in termination can 
be added (optional) as a compensation for comparator offset 
using a programmable top-off timer. During the delay, 
constant voltage charge phase continues and gives the falling 
charge current a chance to drop closer to the programmed 
value. The top-off delay timer has the same restrictions of the 
safety timer. As an example, under some conditions, if the 
safety timer is suspended, the top-off timer will also be 
suspended or if the safety timer is slowed down, the 
termination 
timer 
will 
also 
be 
slowed 
down. 
The 
TOPOFF_ACTIVE bit reports the active/inactive status of the 
top-off timer. The CHRG_STAT[1:0] and TOPOFF_ACTIVE 
bits can be read to find status of the termination. 
Any of the following events resets the top-off timer:  
1. Disable to enable transition of nCE (charge enable). 
2. A low to high change in the status of termination. 
3. Set REG_RST bit to 1. 
The setting of the top-off timer is applied at the time of 
termination detection and unless a new charge cycle is 
started, modifying the top-off timer parameters after 
termination has no effect. A negative pulse is sent to nINT 
when top-off timer is started or ended. 
 
Temperature Qualification 
The charging current and voltage of the battery must be 
limited when battery is cold or hot. A thermistor input for 
battery temperature monitoring is included in the device that 
can protect the battery based on JEITA guidelines. There is 
no battery temperature protection when battery is discharging 
to the system (either boosting or not charging). 
 
Compliance with JEITA Guideline 
JEITA guideline (April 20, 2007 release) is implemented in the 
device for safe charging of the Li-Ion battery. JEITA highlights 
the considerations and limits that should be considered for 
charging at cold or hot battery temperatures. High charge 
current and voltage must be avoided outside the normal 
operating temperatures (typically 0 ℃ and 60 ℃). This 
functionality can be disabled if not needed. Four temperature 
levels are defined by JEITA from T1 (minimum) to T4 
(maximum). Outside this range, charging should be stopped. 
The corresponding voltages sensed by NTC are named VT1 to 
VT4. Due to the sensor negative resistance, a higher 
temperature results in a lower voltage on TS pin. The battery 
cool range is between T1 and T2, and the warm range is 
between T3 and T4. Charge must be limited in the cool and 
warm ranges. 
One of the conditions for starting a charge cycle is having the 
TS voltage within VT1 to VT4 window limits. If the battery is too 
cold or too hot during charging and TS voltage exceeds the 
T1 - T4 limits, charging is suspended (zero charge current) 
and the controller waits for the battery temperature to come 
back within the T1 to T4 window. 
JEITA recommends reducing charge current to 1/2 of fast 
charging current or lower at cool temperatures (T1 - T2). For 
warmer temperature (within T3 - T4 range), charge voltage is 
recommended to be kept below 4.1V. 
The 
SGM41513/SGM41513A/SGM41513D 
exceed 
the 
JEITA requirement by their flexible charge parameter settings. 
At warm temperature range (T3 - T4), the charge voltage is 
set to the lower of VREG and 4.1V when JEITA_VSET_H = 0, 
the charge voltage is set to VREG when JEITA_VSET_H = 1, 
and the charge current can be reduced down to 0%, 20% or 
50% of fast charging current by the JEITA_ISET_H[1:0] bits. 
At cool temperatures (T1 - T2), the current setting can be 
reduced down to 50% or 20% of fast charging current 
selected by the JEITA_ISET_L bit when JEITA_ISET_L_EN = 
1, and the charge voltage is set to VREG when JEITA_VSET_L 
= 0, the charge voltage is set to the lower of VREG and 4.1V 
when JEITA_VSET_L = 1. Additional, the cool threshold T2 
and warm threshold T3 can be changed through JEITA_VT2 
[1:0] and JEITA_VT3 [1:0], and the charge current can be 
disabled by setting JEITA_ISET_L_EN = 0.

results are: RT1 = 5.32kΩ and RT2 = 31.09kΩ. The standard

The device is capable of monitoring the battery temperature 
for safety during the Boost mode. The temperature must 
remain within the VBCOLD to VBHOT thresholds, otherwise the 
Boost mode will be suspended and VBUS_STAT[2:0] bits are 
set to 000. Moreover, NTC_FAULT[2:0] bits are updated to 
report Boost mode cold or hot condition. Once the 
temperature returns within the right window, the Boost mode 
is resumed and NTC_FAULT[2:0] bits are cleared to 000 
(normal).

Safety Timer 
Abnormal battery conditions may result in prolonged charge 
cycles. An internal safety timer is considered to stop charging 
in 
such 
conditions. 
If 
the 
safety 
time 
is 
expired, 
CHRG_FAULT[1:0] bits are set to 11 and a negative pulse is 
sent to nINT pin. By default, the charge time limit is 2 hours if 
the battery voltage does not rise above VBATLOW threshold. 
And it is 16 hours if it goes above VBATLOW. This feature is 
optional and can be disabled by clearing EN_TIMER bit. The 
16 hours limit can also be reduced to 7 hours by clearing 
CHG_TIMER bit. 
The safety timer counts at half clock rate when charger is 
running under input voltage regulation, input current 
regulation, JEITA cool or thermal regulation. Because in 
these conditions, the actual charge current is likely to be less 
than the register setting. As an example, if the safety timer is 
set to 7 hours and the charger is regulating the input current 
(IINDPM_STAT bit = 1) in the whole charging cycle, the 
actual safety time will be 14 hours. Clearing the TMR2X_EN 
bit will disable the half clock rate feature. 
The safety timer is paused if a fault occurs and charging is 
suspended. It will resume once the fault condition is removed. 
If charging cycle is stopped by a restart or by toggling nCE pin 
or CHG_CONFIG bit, the timer resets and restarts a new 
timing.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Narrow Voltage DC (NVDC) Design in 
SGM41513/SGM41513A/SGM41513D 
The SGM41513/SGM41513A/SGM41513D feature an NVDC 
design using the BATFET that connects the system to the 
battery. By using the linear region of the BATFET, the charger 
regulates the system bus voltage (SYS pin) above the 
minimum setting using Buck converter even if the battery 
voltage is very low. MOSFET linear mode allows for the large 
voltage difference between SYS and BAT pins to appear as 
VDS across the switch while conducting and charging battery. 
SYS_MIN[2:0] register sets the minimum system voltage 
(default 3.5V). If the system is in minimum system voltage 
regulation, VSYS_STAT bit is set. 
The BATFET operates in linear region when the battery 
voltage is lower than the minimum system voltage. The 
system voltage is regulated to 180mV (TYP) above the 
minimum system voltage setting. The battery is gradually 
charged and its voltage rises above the minimum system 
voltage and lets BATFET change from linear mode to fully 
turned-on switch such that the voltage difference between the 
system and battery is the small VDS of fully on BATFET. 
The system voltage is always regulated to 50mV (TYP) above 
the battery voltage if: 
1. The charging is terminated. 
2. Charging is disabled and the battery voltage is above the 
minimum system voltage setting.  
 
 
Figure 8. System Voltage vs. Battery Voltage 
 
SGM41513/SGM41513A/SGM41513D Dynamic 
Power Management (DPM) 
The 
SGM41513/SGM41513A/SGM41513D 
feature 
a 
dynamic power management (DPM). To implement DPM, the 
device always monitors the input current and voltage to 
regulate power demand from the source and avoid input 
adaptor overloading or to meet the maximum current limits 
specified in the USB specs. Overloading an input power 
source may result in either the voltage tending to fall below 
the input voltage limit (VINDPM) or the current trying to exceed 
the input current limit (IINDPM). With DPM, the device keeps the 
VSYS regulating to its minimum setting by reducing the 
battery charge current adequately such that the input 
parameter (voltage or current) does not exceed the limit. In 
other words, charge current is reduced to satisfy IIN ≤ IINDPM or 
VIN ≥ VINDPM whichever occurs first. DPM can be either an IIN 
type (IINDPM) or VIN type (VINDPM) depending on which limit 
is reached. 
Changing to the supplement mode may be required if the 
charge current is decreased and reached to zero while the 
input is still overloaded. In this case, the charger reduces the 
system voltage below the battery voltage to allow operation in 
the supplement mode and provide a portion of system power 
demand from the battery through the BATFET. 
The IINDPM_STAT or VINDPM_STAT status bits are set 
during an IINDPM or VINDPM respectively. Figure 9 
summarizes the DPM behavior (IINDPM type) for a design 
example with a 9V/1.2A adaptor, 3.2V battery, 2.8A charge 
current setting and 3.4V minimum system voltage setting.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Battery Supplement Mode 
If the system voltage drops 45mV below the battery voltage, 
the BATFET gradually starts to turn on. At low discharge 
currents, the BATFET gate voltage is regulated (RDS 
modulation) such that the BATFET VDS stays at 28mV. At 
higher currents, the BATFET will turn fully on (reaching its 
lowest RDSON). From this point, increasing the discharge 
current will linearly increase the BATFET VDS (determined by 
RDSON × ID). Using the MOSFET linear mode at lower currents 
prevents swinging oscillation from entering and exiting the 
supplement mode. 
BATFET gate regulation V-I characteristics is shown in Figure 
10. If the battery voltage falls below its minimum depletion, 
the BATFET turns off and exits supplement mode.  
 
Figure 10. BATFET Gate Regulation V-I Curve 
 
BATFET Control for System Power Reset 
and Ship Mode 
Ship Mode (BATFET Disable) 
Ship mode is usually used when the system is stored or in 
idle state for a long time or is in shipping. In such conditions, it 
is better to completely disconnect battery and make system 
voltage zero to minimize the leakage and extend the battery 
life. To enter ship mode, the BATFET has to be forced off by 
setting BATFET_DIS bit. The BATFET turns off immediately if 
BATFET_DLY bit is 0, or turns off after a tSM_DLY delay (12 
seconds) if BATFET_DLY is set. 
 
Exit Ship Mode (BATFET Enable) 
To exit the ship mode and enable the BATFET, one of the 
following can be applied: 
With no input power (no operating VBUS): 
1. Connect the adaptor to the input with a valid voltage to the 
VBUS input. 
2. Pull nQON pin from logic high to low to enable BATFET, for 
example, by shorting nQON to GND. The negative pulse 
width should be at least a tSHIPMODE (1s TYP) for deglitching. 
With the chip already powered by VBUS: 
3. Clear BATFET_DIS bit by using host and I2C. 
4. Set REG_RST bit to 1 to reset all registers. 
5. Apply a negative pulse to nQON pin (same as 2). 
 
Full System Reset with BATFET Using nQON 
When the input source is not present, the BATFET can act as 
a load on/off switch between the system and battery. This 
feature can be used to apply a power-on reset to the system. 
Host can toggle BATFET_DIS bit to cycle power off/on and 
reset the system. A push-button connected to nQON pin or a 
negative pulse can also be used to manually force a system 
power cycle when BATFET is ON (BATFET_DIS bit = 0). For 
this function, a negative logic pulse with a minimum width of 
tQON_RST (10s TYP) must be applied to the nQON pin that 
results in a temporary BATFET turn-off for tBATFET_RST (320ms 
TYP) that automatically turns on afterward. This functionality 
can be disabled by setting BATFET_RST_EN bit to 0. 
In summary, the nQON pin controls BATFET and system 
reset in two different ways: 
1. Enable BATFET: Applying an nQON logic high to low 
transition with longer than tSHIPMODE deglitch time (negative 
pulse) turns on BATFET to exit ship mode (Figure 11 left). HIZ 
is also enabled (EN_HIZ = 1) when exiting shipping mode. 
After exiting shipping mode, the host can disable HIZ (EN_HIZ 
= 0). OTG cannot be enabled until HIZ is disabled 
(OTG_CONFIG = 1). 
2. Reset BATFET: By applying a logic low for a duration of at 
least tQON_RST to nQON pin while VBUS is not powered and 
BATFET is allowed to turn on (BATFET_DIS bit = 0), the 
BATFET turns off for tBATFET_RST and then it is re-enabled 
resulting in a system power-on reset (Figure 11 right). This 
function can be disabled by clearing BATFET_RST_EN bit. 
A typical push button circuit for nQON is given in Figure 12.

Status Outputs Pins (nPG, STAT and nINT) 
Power Good Indication (nPG Pin and PG_STAT Bit) 
When a good input source is connected to VBUS and input 
type is detected, the PG_STAT status bit goes high and the 
nPG pin goes low. A good input source is detected if all 
following conditions on VVBUS are satisfied and input type 
detection is completed: 
• VVBUS is in the operating range: VVAC_UVLOZ < VVBUS < VVAC_OV. 
• Device is not in sleep mode: VVBUS > VBAT + VSLEEP. 
• Input source is not poor: VVBUS > VVBUSMIN (3.8V TYP) when 
IBAD_SRC (30mA TYP) loading is applied. (Poor source 
detection.) 
• Completed input source type detection. 
 
Charge Status (STAT Pin) 
Charging state is indicated with the open-drain STAT pin as 
explained in Table 6. This pin is able to drive an LED (see 
Figure 1). The functionality of the STAT pin is disabled if the 
EN_ICHG_MON[1:0] bits are set to 10 or 11.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
nINT Interrupt Output Pin 
When a new update occurs in the charger states, a 256μs 
negative pulse is sent through the nINT pin to interrupt the 
host. The host may not continuously monitor the charger 
device and by receiving the interrupt, it can react and check 
the charger situation on time. 
The following events can generate an interrupt pulse: 
1. Faults reflect in REG09 register (watchdog, Boost 
overload, charge faults and battery over-voltage). 
2. Charging is completed. 
3. PSEL or D+/D- detection identifies a connected source 
(USB or adaptor). 
4. Input source voltage enters the "input good" range: 
a) VVBUS exceeds VBAT (not in sleep mode). 
b) VVBUS comes below VVAC_OV. 
c) VVBUS remains above VVBUSMIN (3.8V TYP) when 
IBAD_SRC (30mA TYP) load current is applied. 
5. Input removes or out of the "input good" range. 
6. A DPM event (VINDPM or IINDPM) occurs (a maskable 
interrupt). 
Once a fault/flag happens, the INT pulse is asserted 
immediately and the fault/flag bits are updated in REG09 and 
REG0E. Fault/flag status is not reset in the register until the 
host reads it. A new fault/flag will not assert a new INT pulse 
until the host reads REG09 and REG0E and all the previous 
faults/flags are cleared. Therefore, in order to read the current 
time faults, the host must read REG09 two times 
consecutively. The first read returns the history of the fault 
register status (from the time of the last read or reset) and the 
second one checks the current active faults. As an exception, 
the NTC_FAULT bit reports the actual real-time status of TS 
pin. 
 
Current Pulse Control Protocol 
The device provides the control to generate the VBUS current 
pulse protocol to communicate with adjustable high voltage 
adaptor, in order to signal adaptor to increase or decrease 
output voltage. To enable the interface, the EN_PUMPX bit 
must be set. Then the host can select the increase/decrease 
voltage pulse by setting either the PUMPX_UP or 
PUMPX_DN bit to start the VBUS current pulse sequence. 
During the current pulse sequence, the PUMPX_UP and 
PUMPX_DN bits are set to indicate pulse sequence in 
progress and the device pulses the input current limit 
between current limit set forth by IINDPM[4:0] register and the 
100mA current limit. When the pulse sequence is completed, 
the input current limit is returned to value set by IINDPM[4:0] 
register and the PUMPX_UP or PUMPX_DN bit is cleared. In 
addition, the EN_PUMPX can be cleared during the current 
pulse sequence to terminate the sequence and force charger 
to return to input current limit as setting forth by the 
IINDPM[4:0] register immediately. When EN_PUMPX bit is 
low, writing to PUMPX_UP and PUMPX_DN bits would be 
ignored, which has no effect on VBUS current limit. 
 
SGM41513/SGM41513A/SGM41513D 
Protection Features 
Monitoring of Voltage and Current 
During the converter operation, the input and system voltages 
(VBUS and VSYS) and switch currents are constantly 
monitored to assure safe operation of the device in both Buck 
and Boost modes, as described below. 
 
Buck Mode Voltage and Current Monitoring 
1. Input Over-Voltage (ACOV) 
Converter switching will stop as soon as VBUS voltage 
exceeds VVAC_OV over-voltage limit that is programmable by 
OVP[1:0] in REG06. It is selectable among 5.5V, 6.5V, 10.5V 
and 14V (default) for USB or 5V, 9V or 12V adaptors 
respectively. 
Each time VBUS exceeds the OVP limit, an INT pulse is 
asserted. As long as the over-voltage persists, the 
CHRG_FAULT[1:0] bits are set to 01 in REG09. Fault will be 
cleared to 00 if the voltage comes back below limit (and a 
hysteresis threshold) and host reads the fault register. 
Charger resumes its normal operation when the voltage 
comes back below OVP limit. 
2. System Over-Voltage (SYSOVP) 
During a system load transient, the device clamps the system 
voltage to protect the system components from over-voltage. 
The SYSOVP over-voltage limit threshold is 350mV + 
VSYS_REG (system regulation voltage + 350mV). Once a 
SYSOVP occurs, switching stops to clamp any overshoot and 
a 30mA sink current is applied to SYS to pull the voltage 
down.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Boost Mode Voltage and Current Monitoring 
In Boost mode, the RBFET (reverse blocking) and LSFET 
(low-side switch) FET currents and VBUS voltage are 
monitored for protection. 
1. Soft-Start on VBUS 
Boost mode begins with a soft-start to prevent large inrush 
currents when it is enabled. 
2. Output Short Protection for VBUS 
Short-circuit protection is provided for VBUS output in Boost 
mode. To accept different types of load connected to VBUS 
and OTG adaptation, an accurate constant current regulation 
control is implemented for Boost mode. In case of a 
short-circuit on VBUS pin, the Q1 turns off and retries 7 times 
(Hiccup). If short is not removed after retries, the OTG will be 
disabled by clearing OTG_CONFIG bit. Also, an INT pulse is 
sent and the BOOST_FAULT bit is set to 1 in REG09. When 
the host activates the Boost mode again, the BOOST_FAULT 
bit will be cleared. 
3. Output Over-Voltage Protection for VBUS 
In Boost mode, converter stops switching and exits Boost 
mode (by clearing OTG_CONFIG bit) if VBUS voltage rises 
above regulation and exceeds the VOTG_OVP over-voltage limit 
(6V TYP). An INT pulse is sent and the BOOST_FAULT bit is 
set to 1. 
 
SGM41513/SGM41513A/SGM41513D Thermal 
Regulation and Shutdown 
Buck Mode Thermal Protections 
Internal junction temperature (TJ) is always monitored to 
avoid overheating. A limit of +120 ℃ is considered for 
maximum IC surface temperature in Buck mode and if TJ 
intends to exceed this level, the device reduces the charge 
current to keep maximum temperature limited to +120℃ 
(thermal regulation mode) and sets the THERM_STAT bit to 1. 
As expected, the actual charging current is usually lower than 
programmed value during thermal regulation. Therefore, the 
safety timer runs at half clock rate and charge termination is 
disabled during thermal regulation. 
If the junction temperature exceeds TSHUT (+150℃), thermal 
shutdown protection arises in which the converter is turned off, 
CHRG_FAULT[1:0] bits are set to 10 in the fault register and 
an INT pulse is sent.  
When the device recovers and TJ falls below the hysteresis 
band of TSHUT_HYS (30℃ under TSHUT), the converter resumes 
automatically. 
 
Boost Mode Thermal Protections 
Similar to Buck mode, TJ is monitored in Boost mode for 
thermal shutdown protection. If junction temperature exceeds 
TSHUT (+150 ℃), the Boost mode will be disabled 
(OTG_CONFIG bit clears). If TJ falls below the hysteresis 
band of TSHUT_HYS (30℃ under TSHUT), the Boost can recover 
again by re-enabling OTG_CONFIG bit by host. 
 
Battery Protections 
Battery Over-Voltage Protection (BATOVP) 
The over-voltage limit for the battery is 4% above the battery 
regulation voltage setting. In case of a BATOVP, charging or 
external direct charging stops right away, the BAT_FAULT bit 
is set to 1 and an INT pulse is sent. 
 
Battery Over-Discharge Protection 
If battery discharges too much and VBAT falls below the 
depletion level (VBAT_DPL_FALL), the device turns off BATFET to 
protect battery. This protection is latched and is not recovered 
until an input source is connected to the VBUS pin. In such 
condition, the battery will start charging with the small ISHORT 
current (95mA TYP) first as long as VBAT < VSHORTZ. When 
battery voltage is increased and VSHORTZ < VBAT < VBATLOW, 
the charge current will increase to the pre-charge current 
level programmed in the IPRECHG[3:0] register. 
 
Battery Over-Current Protection for System 
The BATFET will latch off, if its current limit is exceeded due to 
a short or large overload on the system (IBAT > IBATOP). To reset 
this latch off and enable BATFET, the "Exit Ship Mode" 
procedure must be followed.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
I2C Serial Interface and Data Communication 
Standard I2C interface is used to program SGM41513/ 
SGM41513A/SGM41513D parameters and get status reports. 
I2C is the well-known 2-wire serial communication interface 
that can connect one (or more) master device(s) to some 
slave devices for two-way communication. The bus lines are 
named serial data (SDA) and serial clock (SCL). The device 
that initiates a data transfer is a master. A master generates 
the SCL signal. Slave devices have unique addresses to 
identify. A master is typically a micro controller or a digital 
signal processor. 
The SGM41513/SGM41513A/SGM41513D operate as a 
slave device that address is 0x1A (1AH). It has sixteen 8-bit 
registers, numbered from REG00 to REG0F. A register read 
beyond REG0F (0x0F) returns 0xFF. 
 
Physical Layer 
The standard I2C interface of SGM41513/SGM41513A/ 
SGM41513D supports standard mode and fast mode 
communication speeds. The frequency of stand mode is up to 
100kbits/s, while the fast mode is up to 400kbits/s. Bus lines 
are pulled high by weak current source or pull-up resistors 
and in logic high state with no clocking when the bus is free. 
The SDA and SCL pins are open-drain. 
 
I2C Data Communication 
START and STOP Conditions 
A transaction is started through taking control of the bus by 
master if the bus is free. The transaction is terminated by 
releasing the bus when the data transfer job is done as shown 
in Figure 13. All transactions are started by master which 
applies a START condition on the bus lines to take over the 
bus and exchange data. At the end, the master terminates the 
transaction by applying one (or more) STOP condition. 
START condition is generated by master when SCL is high 
and a high to low transition on the SDA. Similarly, a STOP is 
defined when SCL is high and SDA goes from low to high. 
START and STOP are always generated by a master. After a 
START and before a STOP the bus is considered busy.

Data Bit Transmission and Validity 
The data bit (high or low) must remain stable on the SDA line 
during the HIGH period of the clock. The state of the SDA can 
only change when the clock (SCL) is LOW. For each data bit 
transmission, one clock pulse is generated by master. Bit 
transfer in I2C is shown in Figure 14.

Byte Format 
Data is transmitted in 8-bit packets (one byte at a time). The 
number of bytes in one transaction is not limited. In each 
packet, the 8 bits are sent successively with the Most 
Significant Bit (MSB) first. An acknowledge (or not-acknowledge) 
bit must come after the 8 data bits. This bit informs the 
transmitter whether the receiver is ready to proceed for the 
next byte or not. Figure 15 shows the byte transfer process 
with I2C interface.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Acknowledge (ACK) and Not Acknowledge (NCK) 
After transmission of each byte by transmitter, an 
acknowledge bit is replied by the receiver as the ninth bit. 
With the acknowledge bit, the receiver informs the transmitter 
that the byte is received, and another byte is expected or can 
be sent (ACK) or it is not expected (NCK = not ACK). Clock 
(SCL) is always generated by master, including the 
acknowledge clock pulse, no matter who is acting as 
transmitter or receiver. SDA line is released for receiver 
control during the acknowledge clock pulse. And the receiver 
can pull the SDA line low as ACK (reply a 0 bit) or let it be 
high as NCK during the SCL high pulse. After that, the master 
can either STOP (P) to end the transaction or send a new 
START (S) condition to start a new transfer (called repeated 
start). For example, when master wants to read a register in 
slave, one start is needed to send the slave address and 
register address, and then, without a stop condition, another 
start is sent by master to initiate the receiving transaction 
from slave. Master then sends the STOP condition and 
releases the bus. 
 
Data Direction Bit and Addressing Slaves 
The first byte sent by master after the START is always the 
target slave address (7 bits) and the eighth data-direction bit 
(R/W). R/W bit is 0 for a WRITE transaction and 1 for READ 
(when master is asking for data). Data direction is the same 
for all next bytes of the transaction. To reverse it, a new 
START or repeated START condition must be sent by master 
(STOP will end the transaction). Usually the second byte is a 
WRITE sending the register address that is supposed to be 
accesses in the next byte(s). The data transfer transaction is 
shown in Figure 16. 
WRITE: If the master wants to write in the register, the third 
byte can be written directly as shown in Figure 17 for a single 
write data transfer. After receiving the ACK, master may issue 
a STOP condition to end the transaction or send the next 
register data, which will be written to the next address in a 
slave as multi-write. A STOP is needed after sending the last 
data.  
READ: If the master wants to read a single register (Figure 
18), it sends a new START condition along with device 
address with R/W bit = 1. After ACK is received, master reads 
the SDA line to receive the content of the register. Master 
replies with NCK to inform slave that no more data is needed 
(single read) or it can send an ACK to request for sending the 
next register content (multi-read). This can continue until an 
NCK is sent by master. A STOP must be sent by master in 
any case to end the transaction.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Data Transactions with Multi-Read or Multi-Write 
Multi-read and multi-write are supported by SGM41513/ 
SGM41513A/SGM41513D for REG00 through REG0F 
registers, except for REG09 and REG0E as explained in 
Figure 19 and Figure 20. REG09 (fault register) and REG0E 
(Flag register) are skipped in multi-read/writes. In the 
multi-write, every new data byte sent by master is written to 
the next register of the device. A STOP is sent whenever 
master is done with writing into device registers. 
In a multi-read transaction, after receiving the first register 
data (its address is already written to the slave), the master 
replies with an ACK to ask the slave for sending the next 
register data. This can continue as much as it is needed by 
master. Master sends back an NCK after the last received 
byte and issues a STOP condition.

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
The SGM41513/SGM41513A/SGM41513D are typically used 
as a charger with power path management in smart phones, 
tablets and other portable devices. In the design, it comes 
along with a host controller (a processor with I2C interface) 
and a single-cell Li-Ion or Li-polymer battery. 
 
Detailed Design Procedure 
Inductor Design 
Small energy storage elements (inductor and capacitor) can 
be used since the high frequency (1.5MHz) switching 
converter is used in the SGM41513/SGM41513A/SGM41513D. 
Inductor should tolerate current which is higher than the 
maximum charge current (ICHG) plus half the inductor peak to 
peak ripple current (∆I) without saturation: 
 
∆
>

SAT
CHG

(3) 
The inductor ripple current is determined by the input voltage 
(VVBUS), duty cycle (D = VBAT/VVBUS), switching frequency (fS = 
1.5MHz) and the inductance (L). In CCM:

(4) 
Inductor ripple current is maximum when D ≈ 0.5. If the input 
voltage range (VVBUS) is limited higher, D values can be 
considered.  
In the practical designs, inductor peak to peak current ripple 
is selected in a range from 20% to 40% of the maximum DC 
current ∆I = (0.2 ~ 0.4) × ICHG for a good trade-off between 
inductor size and efficiency. Selecting the higher ripple allows 
choosing of smaller inductance. 
For each application, VVBUS and ICHG are known, so L can be 
calculated from (4) and current rating of the inductor can be 
selected from (3). Choose an inductor that has small DCR 
and core losses at 1.5MHz to have high efficiency and cool 
operation at full load. 
 
Input Capacitor Design 
Select low ESR ceramic input capacitor (X7R or X5R) with 
sufficient voltage and RMS ripple current rating for decoupling 
of the input switching ripple current (ICIN). The RMS ripple 
current in the worst case is around the ICHG/2 when D ≈ 0.5. If 
the converter does not operate at D ≈ 50%, in the worst case, 
the capacitor RMS current can be estimated from (5) in which 
D is the closest operating duty cycle to 0.5.

(5) 
For SGM41513/SGM41513A/SGM41513D, place CIN across 
PMID and GND pins close to the chip. Voltage rating of the 
capacitor must be at least 25% higher than the normal input 
voltage to minimize voltage derating. For a 13.5V input 
voltage, the preferred rating is 25V or higher. 
A CIN = 22μF is suggested. 
 
Output Capacitor Design 
The output capacitance (on the system) must have enough 
RMS (ripple) current rating to carry the inductor switching 
ripple and provide enough energy for system transient current 
demands. ICOUT (COUT RMS current) can be calculated by:

(7) 
Increasing L or COUT (the LC filter) can reduce the ripple.  
The internal loop compensation of the device is optimized for > 
22μF ceramic output capacitor. 10V, X7R (or X5R) ceramic 
capacitors are recommended for the output. 
The design is based on Buck mode operation that has almost 
2.5 times higher current rating (3A) compared to the Boost 
mode (1.2A). The design is sufficient for proper Boost 
operation, because converter is bidirectional and only the 
direction of currents is reversed. 
 
Input Power Supply Considerations 
To power the system from the SGM41513/SGM41513A/ 
SGM41513D, either an input power source with a voltage 
range from 3.9V to 13.5V and at least 100mA current rating 
should power VBUS, or a single-cell Li-Ion battery with 
voltage higher than VBAT_UVLOZ should be connected to BAT 
pin of the device. The input source must have enough current 
rating to allow maximum power delivery through charger 
(Buck converter) to the system.

APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued) 
Layout Guidelines 
The switching node (SW) creates very high frequency noises, 
which are several times higher than fSW (1.5MHz) due to 
sharp rise and fall of the voltage and current in the switches. 
To reduce the ringing issues and noise generation, it is 
important to design a proper layout for minimizing the current 
path impedance and loop area. A graphical guideline for the 
current loops and their frequency content is provided in 
Figure 21. The following considerations can help to make a 
better layout.  
1. Place the input capacitor between PMID and GND pins as 
close as possible to the chip with the shortest copper 
connections (avoid vias). Choose the smallest capacitor size. 
2. Connect one pin of the inductor as close as possible to the 
SW pin of the device and minimize the copper area 
connected to the SW node to reduce capacitive coupling from 
SW area to nearby signal traces. This decreases the noise 
induced 
through 
parasitic 
stray 
capacitances 
and 
displacement currents to other conductors. SW connection 
should be wide enough to carry the charging current. Keep 
other signals and traces away from SW if possible. 
3. Place output capacitor GND pin as close as possible to the 
GND pin of the device and the GND pin of input capacitor CIN. 
It is better to avoid using vias for these connections and keep 
the high frequency current paths short enough and on the 
same layer. A GND copper layer under the component layer 
helps to reduce noise emissions. Note that the DC current 
and AC current paths are in the layout and keep them short 
and decoupled as much as possible. 
4. For analog signals, it is better to use a separate analog 
ground (AGND) branched only at one point from GND pin. To 
avoid high current flow through the AGND path, it should be 
connected to GND only at one point (preferably the GND pin). 
5. Place decoupling capacitors close to the IC pins with the 
shortest copper connections. 
6. Solder the exposed thermal pad of the package to the PCB 
ground planes. Ensure that there are enough thermal vias 
directly under the IC, connecting to the ground plane on the 
other layers for better heat dissipation and cooling of the 
device. 
7. Select proper sizes for the vias and ensure that enough 
copper is available to carry the current for the given current 
path. Vias usually have some considerable parasitic 
inductance and resistance.
