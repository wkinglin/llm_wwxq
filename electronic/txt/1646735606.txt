MARCH2022–REV.A 
GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM6061 is a high voltage and high frequency 
Buck converter with 1.5A maximum output current and 
integrated high-side power MOSFET. It implements 
peak current mode control to simplify external 
compensation design. 
With a wide input voltage range of 3.8V to 55V, it is 
suitable for a broad range of applications such as 
industry equipment. 
The SGM6061 operates at fixed frequency and enters 
PFM (Pulse Frequency Modulation) mode automatically 
at light load to maintain high efficiency. During startup 
and thermal shutdown, the frequency foldback 
technique is used to avoid inductor current runaway for 
reliable and fault tolerant operation. The current limit 
foldback technique is used for reducing power 
consumption during output shorted and suppressing 
output voltage overshot during recovery. 
Switching frequency can be set as high as 2MHz. It 
minimizes the EMI noise issues that could interfere with 
nearby systems such as AM radio or ADSL modems. 
The SGM6061 is available in a Green TDFN-3×3-10L 
package. It operates over a junction temperature range 
of -40℃ to +125℃.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
Overview 
The SGM6061 is a 3.8V to 55V, 1.5A non-synchronous 
Buck converter with integrated high-side N-channel 
MOSFET. It is a perfect solution for efficient single 
stage Buck applications. The integrated functions 
include 
precision 
current 
limiting, 
automatically 
switched PWM and PFM modes, adjustable soft-start 
ramp time and wide range switching frequency, which 
can meet different requirements. Peak current mode 
control is implemented to provide fast load transient 
response and simple compensation. 
VIN Under-Voltage Lockout (UVLO) 
The SGM6061 integrates VIN under-voltage lockout 
(UVLO) 
feature 
to 
protect 
the 
device 
from 
malfunctioning when the input voltage is insufficient to 
properly power up the internal circuits. The UVLO rising 
threshold is 3.14V (TYP) and has a 0.59V (TYP) 
hysteresis. 
Internal 2.6V Regulator 
An internal 2.6V regulator powers most of the device 
internal circuits. The 2.6V output is fully regulated when 
VIN exceeds 3.14V. It will drop if VIN falls below 3.14V. 
Enable Input 
The EN pin is an active high input to enable or disable 
the device. The EN rising threshold voltage VENR is 
1.58V (TYP) and has a 460mV (TYP) hysteresis. 
A 1μA internal current source pulls the EN pin up to 
approximately 3.0V. Therefore the device will be 
enabled when the EN pin is left floating. To disable the 
device, pull the EN pin down below 1.12V with at least 
1µA sink capability.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
When VEN falls below 1.12V, the device is disabled and 
enters low shutdown current mode. When VEN exceeds 
0V and does not reach VENR, the device is still disabled 
but with slightly higher shutdown current. 
 
Startup and Shutdown 
If both VIN and VEN exceed their thresholds, the device 
is enabled and starts operation. First, the bandgap 
circuit starts working to generate stable reference 
voltage and bias current. Then two internal regulators 
are established to provide supply voltage for internal 
analog and digital circuit respectively. About 30µs later, 
bootstrap capacitor voltage is charged above UVLO 
threshold. Then SS output starts to rise at the rate set 
by C5. 
The device is disabled when any of invalid EN voltage, 
VIN UVLO and thermal shutdown events occurs. Once 
the device is disabled, the high-side switch is turned off 
immediately to avoid any other fault triggering. 
Soft-Start and Ramp 
Every time the device is enabled (after power-up, 
pulling EN high or a fault recovery), the output voltage 
is gradually increased to its regulation value with a 
ramp (after a brief 50µs hold). Soft-start is needed to 
prevent triggering of current limit or short-circuit 
protections or to avoid output overshooting during 
startup. Without a soft-start, the inrush currents of the 
output capacitors or the load can cause over-current 
and the protection procedure results in non-monotonic 
startup or even instability. Overshooting may also occur 
during startup after short-circuit recovery. The internal 
soft-start voltage (VSS) is almost 0.2V higher than FB 
voltage (VFB). The VSS and reference (VREF) are both 
sent to the error amplifier and the lower value of them is 
the actual reference that is compared with the feedback 
voltage (VFB). 
A 4.9μA pull-up current source is internally connected 
to the SS pin. The soft-start time (tSS) is the time 
interval that the external soft-start capacitor (C5) 
voltage increases by 0.8V. Therefore, the soft-start time 
can be calculated from:

Figure 3. Recommended SS Time vs. SS Capacitance 
 
Figure 3 shows the soft-start time with a wide range of 
external soft-start capacitance values. The recommended 
soft-start capacitance range is from 5.6nF to 220nF. 
PWM Operation Mode 
In the moderate to heavy load conditions, the 
SGM6061 runs at fixed frequency with peak current 
control mode. The high-side MOSFET is turned on at 
the leading edge of internal clock until the sensing 
current ramp signal reaches the COMP voltage. If the 
switch current does not reach the reference value 
(conversion from VC) in a cycle, the switch will also be 
turned off for tOFF_MIN (100ns, TYP) before the next 
clock. 
PFM Mode 
In the light load condition, the frequency is reduced 
depending on the load to minimize the switching and 
gate driving losses and keep the efficiency high. 
PWM Comparator and Current Limit 
For peak current mode, a signal represent of high-side 
current is used as the input of PWM comparator, which 
is accurately sampled by internal sensing circuit. After 
100ns typical blanking time, the signal is compared with 
COMP to determine switching state of high-side 
MOSFET. The cycle-by-cycle current limit threshold is 
approximately 2.55A. 
Note that the measured peak current limits in the 
closed-loop and open-loop test conditions are slightly 
different, mainly caused by the propagation delay.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Bootstrap Floating MOSFET Driver 
The power of the high-side MOSFET driver is provided 
by an external capacitor between BOOT and SW pins. 
An internal bootstrap regulator keeps the bootstrap 
capacitor charged and regulated to approximately 4.5V. 
The bootstrap voltage is detected by internal BOOT 
UVLO circuit with 2.4V rising threshold and 250mV 
hysteresis. If the bootstrap voltage falls below its UVLO 
threshold, the power MOSFET is turned off immediately. 
An internal transistor is used to pull down the SW node 
to make sure BOOT capacitor is charged sufficiently. 
This design can obviously reduce the output voltage 
ripple at small input/output voltage difference and no 
load. When the bootstrap voltage is charged above 
threshold, the pull-down transistor is turned off and 
high-side MOSFET is able to be turned on again. 
Except for BOOT UVLO condition, the external circuit 
connected to the SW serves as the return path to GND 
for the charge current. Enough voltage headroom 
should be left to facilitate the charging. When the 
external freewheeling diode is on, bootstrap charging 
starts until the regulated voltage. 
The converter operates in PFM Mode at no load or light 
load, to minimize switching losses and keep the output 
regulated. In this mode, the available time for 
refreshing the BOOT voltage is reduced, bootstrap 
voltage will drop below the regulated voltage (4.5V). 
The maximum charged voltage is equal to VIN - VOUT. If 
the difference of VIN - VOUT is too small, BOOT UVLO 
can be triggered. The internal charging circuit charges 
the bootstrap capacitor by the set frequency, until 
BOOT UVLO is released. 
The designer should make sure that the SW node 
bleeding current is higher than the quiescent current of 
the floating driver (approximately 20µA). Usually the 
feedback resistors (R1 and R2) are selected such that 
the R1 + R2 value is small enough to provide that 
current:

External Bootstrap Diode 
To improve the efficiency, using an external boot diode 
supplied from a 5V rail (in Figure 4) is recommended in 
the following cases: 
 A 5V rail is available. 
 VIN is less than 5V. 
 VOUT is between 3.3V and 5V. 
 High duty cycle applications (VOUT/VIN > 65%). 
A low-cost diode like IN4148 or BAT54 can be used.

For Example, to get 500kHz switching frequency, the 
required R4 resistor is 180kΩ. 
An internal frequency foldback technique is designed 
by monitoring the FB voltage. It can effectively avoid 
the inductor current runaway during startup or 
restarting in certain situation. 
Error Amplifier (EA) 
The output voltage is sensed by a resistor divider 
through the FB pin and is compared with the internal 
reference. The EA generates an output current that is 
proportional to the voltage difference (error). This 
current is fed into the external compensation network to 
generate the VC voltage on the COMP pin, which sets 
the reference value for the peak current that controls 
the on time of the power MOSFET. 
The operating voltage range of COMP (VC) is between 
0.75V and 2.0V in normal conditions. COMP is pulled 
down to the ground when the device shuts down. The 
COMP voltage must not be pulled higher than 2.6V. 
Thermal Shutdown 
To protect the device from damage due to overheating, 
a thermal shutdown feature is implemented to disable 
the device when the die temperature exceeds +155℃
(TYP). The chip is automatically enabled when the 
temperature falls below +135℃ (20℃ hysteresis, TYP).

Design Requirements 
In this example, a high frequency regulator with 
ceramic output capacitors will be designed using 
SGM6061 and the details will be reviewed. The design 
requirements are typically determined at the system 
level. The known requirements are summarized in 
Table 1.

Switching Frequency (fSW)

Operating Frequency 
Usually the first parameter to design is the switching 
frequency (fSW). Higher switching frequencies allow 
smaller solution size and smaller filter inductors and 
capacitors, and the bandwidth of the converter can be 
increased for faster response. It is also easier to filter 
noises because they also shift to higher frequencies. 
The drawbacks are increased switching and gate 
driving losses that result in lower efficiency and tighter 
thermal limits. Also the duty cycle range and step-down 
ratio will be limited due to the minimum on-time and/or 
off-time limits of the converter. In this design, fSW = 
500kHz is chosen as a tradeoff. From Equation 3, the 
nearest standard resistor for this frequency is R4 = 
180kΩ. 
Inductor Design 
Equation 4 is conventionally used to calculate the 
output inductance of a Buck converter. Generally, a 
smaller inductor is preferred to allow larger bandwidth 
and smaller size. The ratio of inductor current ripple (∆IL) 
to the maximum output current (IOUT) is represented as 
KIND factor (∆IL/IOUT). The inductor ripple current is 
bypassed and filtered by the output capacitor and the 
inductor DC current is passed to the output. Inductor 
ripple is selected based on a few considerations. The 
peak inductor current (IOUT + ∆IL/2) must have a safe 
margin from the saturation current of the inductor in the 
worst-case conditions especially if a hard-saturation 
core type inductor (such as ferrite) is chosen. During 
power-up with large output capacitor, over-current, 
output shorted or load transient conditions, the actual 
peak current of inductor can be greater than ILPEAK 
calculated in equation 7. For peak current mode 
converter, selecting an inductor with saturation current 
above the switch current limit is sufficient. Typically, a 
20% to 40% ripple is selected (KIND = 0.2 ~ 0.4). 
Choosing a higher KIND value reduces the selected 
inductance.

APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued) 
In this example, KIND = 0.4 is chosen and the 
inductance is calculated to be 10.4μH. In this example, 
the nearest standard value 10μH is selected. The ripple, 
RMS and peak inductors current calculations are 
summarized in Equations 5, 6 and 7 respectively.

The ripple, RMS, and peak inductor currents are 
calculated as 0.62A, 1.51A and 1.81A respectively. A 
10μH inductor from Sunlord SWPA8040S100MT with 
4.1A saturation and 3.3A RMS current ratings is selected. 
External Diode (D) 
The SGM6061 adopts non-synchronous architecture. 
Therefore an external diode is required to place 
between SW and GND pins. A Schottky diode is 
recommended due to the characteristics of fast 
recovery and small forward conduction voltage drop, 
which can help improve the efficiency and reduce the 
rising edge ring of SW node. 
For main parameters of diode, the maximum reverse 
voltage rating of the selected diode must be greater 
than the maximum applicable input voltage. The peak 
current rating must be greater than the current limit, 
and the average forward current should be greater than 
typical load current with enough margin. 
In this example, a B380-13-F from Diodes Inc. with 80V 
reverse voltage and 3A forward current is selected. 
Output Capacitor Design 
Three primary criteria must be considered for design of 
the output capacitor (COUT): (1) the converter pole 
location, (2) the output voltage ripple, (3) the transient 
response to a large change in load current. The 
selected value must satisfy all of them. The desired 
transient response is usually expressed as maximum 
overshoot, maximum undershoot, or maximum recovery 
time of VOUT in response to a large load step. Transient 
response is usually the more stringent criteria in low 
output voltage applications. The output capacitor must 
provide the increased load current or absorb the 
excess inductor current (when the load current steps 
down) until the control loop can re-adjust the current of 
the inductor to the new load level. Typically, it requires 
two or more cycles for the loop to detect the output 
change and respond (change the duty cycle). It may 
also be expressed as the maximum output voltage drop 
or rise when the full load is connected or disconnected 
(100% load step). Equation 8 can be used to calculate 
the minimum output capacitance that is needed to 
supply or absorb a current step (ΔIOUT) for at least 2 
cycles until the control loop responds to the load 
change with a maximum allowed output transient of 
ΔVOUT (overshoot or undershoot).

For example, if the acceptable transient to a 0.75A load 
step is 7%, by inserting ΔVOUT = 0.07 × 3.3V = 0.231V 
and ΔIOUT = 0.75A, the minimum required capacitance 
will be 13μF. Generally, the ESR of ceramic capacitors 
is small enough. The impact of output capacitor ESR on 
the transient is not taken into account in Equation 8. 
Equation 9 can be used for the output ripple criteria and 
finding the minimum output capacitance needed. 
VORIPPLE is the maximum acceptable ripple. In this 
example, the allowed ripple is 33mV that results in 
minimum capacitance of 4.7μF.

Note that the impact of output capacitor ESR on the

In this example, the ESR must be less than

Higher nominal capacitance value must be chosen due 
to aging, temperature, and DC bias derating of the

capacitor with X7R dielectric and 3mΩ ESR is selected. 
There is a limit to the amount of ripple current that a 
capacitor can handle without damage or overheating. 
The inductor ripple is bypassed through the output 
capacitor. Equation 11 calculates the RMS current that 
the output capacitor must support. In this example, it is 
179mA.

APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued) 
Input Capacitor Design 
A high-quality ceramic capacitor (X5R or X7R or better 
dielectric grade) must be used for input decoupling of 
the SGM6061. If input power is far away from 
SGM6061, additional bulk capacitor is recommended in 
parallel to stabilize input voltage. The RMS value of 
input capacitor can be calculated from Equation 12 and 
the maximum ICIRMS occurs at 50% duty cycle. For this 
example, the maximum input RMS current is 0.75A. 
The ripple current rating of input capacitor should be 
greater than ICIRMS.

where D is the duty cycle. 
In this example, the voltage rating of capacitor should 
have a safe margin from maximum input voltage. 
Therefore, two 2.2μF/100V ceramic capacitors are 
selected for VIN to cover all DC bias, thermal and aging 
deratings, and a 0.1μF/100V capacitor is selected for 
further decoupling of high frequency noise. The small 
capacitor should be connected between VIN and GND 
pins as close as possible. 
The input voltage ripple can be calculated from 
Equation 13, and the maximum ripple occurs at 50% 
duty cycle.

Soft-Start Capacitor 
The soft-start capacitor programs the ramp-up time of 
the output voltage during power-up. The ramp is 
needed in many applications due to limited voltage 
slew rate required by the load or limited available input 
current to avoid input voltage sag during startup (UVLO) 
or to avoid over-current protection that can occur during 
output capacitor charging. Soft-start will solve all these 
issues by limiting the output voltage slew rate.  
In this example, the output capacitor value is relatively 
small and the soft-start time is not critical because it 
does not require too much charge for 3.3V output 
voltage. However, it is better to set a small arbitrary 
value, like C5 = 10nF that results in 1.6ms startup time. 
Bootstrap Capacitor Selection 
A 0.1μF ceramic capacitor with 10V or higher voltage 
rating must be connected between the BOOT and SW 
pin. X5R or better dielectric types are recommended. 
UVLO Setting 
The under-voltage lockout (UVLO) can be programmed 
by an external voltage divider network. In this design, 
the turn-on (enable to start switching) occurs when VIN 
rises above 7.9V (VSATRTUP). When the regulator is in 
operation, it will not stop switching (disabled) until the 
input falls below 5.6V (VSHUTDOWN). Use Equations 13 to 
calculate the resistors value. In this example, choose 
R5 = 100kΩ and R6 = 24.9kΩ.

The nearest 1% resistor for the calculated value (32kΩ) 
is 32.4kΩ. For higher output accuracy, choose resistors 
with better tolerance (0.5% or better).

Loop Compensation Design 
Several techniques are used by engineers to 
compensate a DC/DC regulator. In this simplified 
method, the effects of the slope compensation are 
ignored. Because of this approximation, the actual 
cross over frequency is usually lower than the 
calculated value. 
First, the converter pole (fP), and ESR zero (fZ) are 
calculated from Equations 15 and 16. For COUT, the 
worst derated value of 20μF should be used. Equations 
17 and 18 can be used to find an estimation for 
closed-loop crossover frequency (fCO) as a starting 
point (choose the lower value).

For this design, fP = 3.62kHz and fZ = 2.65MHz. 
Equation 17 yields 98kHz for crossover frequency and 
Equation 18 gives 30kHz. As the influence of slope 
compensation in the actual circuit, a slightly higher 
frequency of 33kHz is selected.

Layout Considerations 
PCB layout is critical for stable and high-performance 
converter operation. The recommend layout is shown in 
Figure 6. 
 Place the nearest input high frequency decoupling 
capacitor (0.1μF) between VIN and GND pins as 
close as possible. 
 Place the larger input ceramic capacitor and 
Schottky diode close to relevant pins for minimizing 
the influence of ground bounce. 
 Use short and wide trace to connect SW node to the 
inductor. Minimize the area of switching loop. 
Otherwise, large voltage spikes on the SW node and 
poor EMI performance are inevitable. 
 Sensitive signal like FB, COMP, EN traces must be 
placed away from high dv/dt nodes (such as SW) 
and not inside any high di/dt loop (like capacitor or 
switch loops). The ground of these signals should be 
connected to GND pin and separated with power 
ground. 
 To improve the thermal relief, use a group of thermal 
vias under the exposed pad to transfer the heat to 
the ground planes in the opposite side of the PCB. 
Use small vias (approximately 15mil) such that they 
can be filled up during the reflow soldering process to 
provide a good metallic heat conduction path from 
the IC exposed pad to the other PCB side. 
 Connect VIN, GND and exposed pad pins to large 
copper areas to increase heat dissipation and 
long-term reliability. Keep SW area small to avoid 
emission issue.
