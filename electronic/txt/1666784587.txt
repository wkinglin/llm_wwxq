GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM7226 is a DPDT (double-pole/double-throw) 
analog switch. It operates from a 1.8V to 5.5V single 
power supply and can be powered directly by VBUS. 
Each switch of the SGM7226 is bidirectional, which can 
ensure that the high speed signals have little or no 
attenuation at the outputs. 
The SGM7226 features high speed, low power and 
wide bandwidth. The high performances make it very 
suitable for multiple applications, such as cellular 
phones and computer peripherals, etc. 
The SGM7226 has a power-off protection. It can 
prevent accidental signal leakage and ensure system 
reliability 
under 
power-down 
and 
over-voltage 
conditions. In addition, the device is capable of 
withstanding a VBUS short to D+ or D- when the device 
is either powered on or powered off due to the special 
circuitry on the D+/D- pins. 
The SGM7226 is available in a Green TQFN-2.6×1.8-16L 
package. It operates over an ambient temperature 
range of -40℃ to +85℃.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
Power-Off Protection 
When D+ or D- is shorted to VBUS, there is a special 
protection circuit inside the SGM7226, so that the 
device will not be damaged within 24 hours. In case of 
power-down or over-voltage event, the protection 
circuit can prevent the leakage signal on D+/D- pins to 
ensure the reliability of the system. 
 
Power-On Protection 
The USB 2.0 specification requires USB device to 
ensure that the device will not be damaged even if VBUS 
short-circuit occurs during data transmission. Therefore, 
under over-voltage conditions, the SGM7226 will limit 
the current flowing back to the VCC track, and the 
current will not exceed the safe operating range. 
 
Application Circuit 
The application circuit is shown in Figure 1. If 
SGM7226 is powered from VBUS, a 5.1V Zener diode is 
recommended to be used to suppress the voltage spike 
in VBUS power line generated by USB interface 
hot-insertion.
