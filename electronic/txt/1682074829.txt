NOVEMBER2020–REV.A.1
 
GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM3714 is a high voltage, dual SPST 
(single-pole/single-throw) analog switch. It operates 
from a 2.7V to 9V single power supply and allows 
rail-to-rail negative signal passing with low distortion. 
In addition, the SGM3714 can be used as audio R&L 
signals or one differential signal switch and power 
switches because it has two single-pole/single-throw 
switches. 
The SGM3714 features low on-resistance, soft switch 
turn-on and turn-off to eliminate click-pop noise, high 
off-Isolation and fast switching times. The high 
performances make it very suitable for multiple 
applications. 
The SGM3714 is available in Green TQFN-3×3-16L 
and WLCSP-1.62×1.23-12B packages. It operates over 
an operating temperature range of -40℃ to +85℃. 
FEATURES 
● Single Supply Voltage Range: 2.7V to 9V 
● Ultra-Low On-Resistance: 0.18Ω (TYP) 
● -VCC to +VCC Rail-to-Rail Low Distortion 
Positive and Negative Signal Passing 
● Soft Switch Turn-On and Turn-Off 
● Adjustable Turn-On and Turn-Off Times: 
 tON = 210ms (VCC = 5V, CTC = 0.1μF) 
 tOFF = 720ms (VCC = 5V, CTC = 0.1μF) 
● High Off-Isolation: -125dB at 20kHz 
● Low Crosstalk: -110dB at 20kHz 
● Low Input Leakage Current 
● Rail-to-Rail Input and Output Operation 
● 1.8V Logic Compatible Control Pin 
● -40℃ to +85℃ Operating Temperature Range 
● Available in Green TQFN-3×3-16L and 
WLCSP-1.62×1.23-12B Packages

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
The combination of Speaker and Receiver is always 
used in portable devices, and high voltage class D 
speaker driver (smart audio PA) is used to drive 
speaker in order to provide high audio volume. But the 
high output voltage of class D speaker driver (10.5V) 
will damage the receiver driver because receiver driver 
is designed using low voltage technology. The 
SGM3714 can solve this design issue by providing the 
safe isolation between receiver driver and high voltage 
class D speaker driver. The SGM3714 provides low 
RON channels to pass the positive and negative signals 
from capless receiver driver and eliminates click-pop 
noise. The circuit is shown in Figure 1.

APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued) 
In order to improve audio performance of portable 
devices, external speaker power amplifier is always 
selected to replace the internal integrated speaker 
power amplifier. Because the audio signal quality of 
audio line-out or headset driver is better than that of the 
integrated speaker power amplifier, the audio signal of 
line-out or headset driver which is selected as the high 
performance audio signal source for external speaker 
power amplifier. High performance SGM3714 is used 
as the 1-to-2 HiFi signal switch in this application. The 
circuit is shown in Figure 2, and a stable 3.3V power 
supply is required in this circuit.
