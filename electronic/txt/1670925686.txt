GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM2037S is a low noise, low dropout voltage 
linear regulator which is designed using CMOS 
technology. It provides 600mA output current capability. 
The operating input voltage range is from 0.9V to 5.5V 
and bias supply voltage range is from 2.5V to 5.5V. The 
fixed output voltage is 0.9V. 
Other features include logic-controlled shutdown mode, 
short-circuit current limit and thermal shutdown 
protection. The SGM2037S has automatic discharge 
function to quickly discharge VOUT in the disabled status. 
The SGM2037S is suitable for applications which need 
low noise, fast transient response and low IQ 
consumption, such as battery-powered equipment and 
smartphones, etc. 
The SGM2037S is available in a Green UTDFN-1.2×1.2-6L 
package. It operates over an ambient temperature range 
of -40℃ to +125℃.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. It recommends that all integrated 
circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. Failure to 
observe proper handling and installation procedures can 
cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
We reserve the right to make any change in circuit design, or 
specifications without prior notice.

PIN DESCRIPTION 
PIN 
NAME 
FUNCTION 
1 
OUT 
Regulated Output Voltage Pin. It is recommended to use output capacitor with effective 
capacitance in the range of 1μF to 10μF. 
2 
NC 
No Connection. 
3 
EN 
Enable Pin. Driving EN high to turn on the regulator. Driving EN low to turn off the regulator. 
The EN pin has an internal pull-down resistance which ensures that the device is turned off 
when the EN pin is floated. 
4 
BIAS 
Bias Voltage Supply for Internal Control Circuits. This pin is monitored by internal 
under-voltage lockout circuit. 
5 
GND 
Ground. 
6 
IN 
Input Voltage Supply Pin. 
Exposed Pad 
‒ 
Exposed Pad. Exposed pad is internally connected to GND. Connect it to a large ground plane 
to maximize thermal performance; not intended as an electrical connection point.
