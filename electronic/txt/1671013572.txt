GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM4588 is an 8-channel single-ended CMOS 
analog multiplexer. The SGM4589 is a dual 4-channel 
differential CMOS analog multiplexer. The SGM4588 
has eight input terminals and a common output terminal, 
which is determined by the 3-bit binary address (A0, A1, 
A2). The SGM4589 has four differential input terminals 
and a common output terminal, which is determined by 
its 2-bit binary address (A0, A1). 
The SGM4588 and SGM4589 can be enabled/disabled 
by controlling the EN pin. Besides, all control terminals 
support 1.8V input logic over the full temperature range. 
Other key features include low on-resistance, low power 
consumption and low charge injection. When multiple 
devices are stacked, the presence of the EN function 
allows resetting the multiplexer/demultiplexer to a state 
where all switches are off. Each channel blocks the 
voltage to the power track in the off state. 
The high performances of SGM4588 and SGM4589 
make them ideal for applications such as single/dual 
signal power supply systems, ATE systems, high-speed 
data acquisition systems and medical equipment. 
The SGM4588 and SGM4589 are available in Green 
SOIC-16 and TSSOP-16 packages. It is specified -40℃ 
to +85℃ temperature range. 
FEATURES 
● ±4.5V to ±20V Dual Supply Operation 
● 4.5V to 40V Single Supply Operation 
● Low On-Resistance: 23Ω (TYP) 
● Low Charge Injection: 18pC 
● Fast Transition Time: 180ns 
● 1.8V Control Logic 
● Reduced Switching Errors 
● Reduced Glitching 
● Improved Data Throughput 
● Reduced Power Consumption 
● Increased Ruggedness 
● -40℃ to +85℃ Operating Temperature Range 
● Available in Green SOIC-16 and TSSOP-16

NOTE: 
1. Internal diodes will clamp any signals on Sx, Dx, or INx that 
exceed VCC or VEE. Limit the current through the forward 
diode to the maximum ratings. 
 
RECOMMENDED OPERATING CONDITIONS 
Operating Temperature Range ....................... 
-40℃ to +85℃ 
OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.
