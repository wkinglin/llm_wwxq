GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM8249-4 is a quad, high voltage, low noise and 
high precision operational amplifier which can operate 
from 4.5V to 36V single supply or from ±2.25V to ±18V 
dual supplies. The device provides rail-to-rail output 
operation. 
The SGM8249-4 offers a low offset voltage less than 
12μV and a low bias current. The combination of 
characteristics makes the SGM8249-4 a good choice 
for temperature measurements, pressure and position 
sensors, 
strain 
gauge 
amplifiers 
and 
medical 
instrumentation, or any other 4.5V to 36V applications 
requiring precision and long-term stability. 
The SGM8249-4 is available in Green SOIC-14 and 
TSSOP-14 packages. It is specified over the extended 
-40℃ to +125℃ temperature range.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
Rail-to-Rail Output 
The SGM8249-4 supports rail-to-rail output operation. 
In single power supply application, for example, when 
+VS = 36V, -VS = GND, 10kΩ load resistor is tied from 
OUT pin to ground, the typical output swing range is 
from 0.185V to 35.815V. 
 
Driving Capacitive Loads 
The SGM8249-4 is unity-gain stable with heavy capacitive 
load. If greater capacitive load must be driven in 
application, the circuit in Figure 1 can be used. In this 
circuit, the IR drop voltage generated by RISO is 
compensated by feedback loop. 
 
 
 
Figure 1. Circuit to Drive Heavy Capacitive Load 
 
Power Supply Decoupling and Layout 
A clean and low noise power supply is very important in 
amplifier circuit design, besides of input signal noise, 
the power supply is one of important source of noise to 
the amplifier through +VS and -VS pins. Power supply 
bypassing is an effective method to clear up the noise 
at power supply, and the low impedance path to ground 
of decoupling capacitor will bypass the noise to GND. 
In application, 10μF ceramic capacitor paralleled with 
0.1μF or 0.01μF ceramic capacitor is used in Figure 2. 
The ceramic capacitors should be placed as close as 
possible to +VS and -VS power supply pins.  
 
 
 
Figure 2. Amplifier Power Supply Bypassing 
 
Grounding 
In low speed application, one node grounding technique 
is the simplest and most effective method to eliminate 
the noise generated by grounding. In high speed 
application, the general method to eliminate noise is to 
use a complete ground plane technique, and the whole 
ground plane will help distribute heat and reduce EMI 
noise pickup. 
 
Reduce Input-to-Output Coupling 
To reduce the input-to-output coupling, the input traces 
must be placed as far away from the power supply or 
output traces as possible. The sensitive trace must not 
be placed in parallel with the noisy trace in same layer. 
They must be placed perpendicularly in different layers 
to reduce the crosstalk. These PCB layout techniques 
will help to reduce unwanted positive feedback and 
noise.

Typical Application Circuits 
Difference Amplifier 
The circuit in Figure 3 is a design example of classical 
difference amplifier. If R4/R3 = R2/R1, then VOUT = (VP - 
VN) × R2/R1 + VREF. 
 
 
 
Figure 3. Difference Amplifier 
 
High Input Impedance Difference Amplifier 
The circuit in Figure 4 is a design example of high input 
impedance difference amplifier, the added amplifiers at 
the input are used to increase the input impedance and 
eliminate drawback of low input impedance in Figure 3. 
 
 
 
Figure 4. High Input Impedance Difference Amplifier 
 
Active Low-Pass Filter 
The circuit in Figure 5 is a design example of active 
low-pass filter, the DC gain is equal to -R2/R1 and the 
-3dB corner frequency is equal to 1/2πR2C. In this 
design, the filter bandwidth must be less than the 
bandwidth of the amplifier, the resistor values must be 
selected as low as possible to reduce ringing or 
oscillation generated by the parasitic parameters in 
PCB layout.
