NOVEMBER 2023–REV.A 
 
GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM90509 features 8 input/output (I/O) pins, 
which can be independently configured as voltage 
digital-to-analog converter (DAC) outputs, analog-to- 
digital converter (ADC) inputs, digital outputs, or digital 
inputs. When an I/O pin is configured as a DAC output, 
it is from a 12-bit DAC output. The output range of the 
DAC can be configured to 0V to VREF or 0V to 2 × VREF 
by software. When an I/O pin is configured as an ADC 
input, its input goes to a 12-bit ADC through the 
multiplexer. The ADC input range can be configured to 
VREF or 2 × VREF by software. The I/O pins can also be 
configured as digital general-purpose input or output 
(GPIO) pins. 
The SGM90509 is operated by a serial peripheral 
interface (SPI). 
The SGM90509 contains an integrated 2.5V, 10ppm/℃
(TYP) reference, and an on-chip temperature sensor, 
which gives an estimation of the die temperature.  
The SGM90509 is available in Green TSSOP-16, 
TQFN-3×3-16BL and WLCSP-2.05×2.05-16B packages. 
It operates over an ambient temperature range of -40℃ 
to +125℃.

RECOMMENDED OPERATING CONDITIONS

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.

NOTES:  
1. Guaranteed by design and characterization. Not production tested. 
2. All specifications are tested with an input signal at 0.5dB below full-scale, unless otherwise noted. All available input ranges 
are described in full-scale input range (FSR), but not performance guaranteed. 
3. DC specifications are tested when the output is floating, unless otherwise noted. The linearity is calculated with the code range 
of 64 to 4032. 
4. When drawing a load current at either power rail, there will be a voltage dropping respect to the power rail as there is a 57Ω 
typical output impedance of the chip output channel. For example, when sourcing 1mA, the minimum output voltage dropping = 
57Ω × 1mA = 57mV.

NOTES: 
1. Guaranteed by design and characterization. Not production tested.  
2. For high-speed applications, the SGM90509 supports the minimum t4 value of 30ns. In this case, the ADC maximum 
throughput rate can be up to 400kSPS, and the typical SNR is 60dB. The 400kSPS throughput rate and 60dB SNR are 
guaranteed only by the characteristic test results with limited samples. For the best ADC performance, t4 > 1.7µs and t8 > 500ns 
are required. Otherwise, t4 > 30ns and t8 > 500ns are required for reading ADC, t4 > 30ns and t8 > 60ns are required for reading 
registers, and t4 > 30ns and t8 > 30ns are required for writing registers.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
DAC Section 
The SGM90509 has eight 12-bit DACs. The DAC output 
range can be set to 0V to VREF or 0V to 2 × VREF. And the 
output range configuration is shared by all channels. The 
input code to the DAC is straight binary, so the ideal output 
voltage can be calculated based on the following equation: 
 


×
×



IN
OUT
REF
N
D
V
 = G
V
2
 
(1) 
Where: 
G = 1 for an output range of 0V to VREF or G = 2 for an output 
range of 0V to 2 × VREF. 
VREF = Voltage on the VREF pin. 
DIN = Decimal equivalent of the binary code, which is loaded 
to the DAC register. It can range from 0 to 4095. 
N = 12.  
 
ADC Section 
The ADC is a fast, 12-bit, single-supply ADC. Each 
conversion takes 2μs. The ADC input range can be 
configured as 0V to VREF or 0V to 2 × VREF. All ADC channels 
share the same input range. The ADC output code is straight 
binary format. It is possible to set an I/Ox pin as both a DAC 
and an ADC. In this case, the I/O is a DAC output, and at the 
same time, the DAC voltage can be read back by an ADC 
conversion and read sequence. The ADC conversion result is 
in 16-bit format, please refer to Table 1. 
 
GPIO Section 
Each I/Ox pins can be used as a GPIO pin. An output can be 
set by write data register. An input can be read by 
configuration register. When an I/Ox pin is set as an output, it 
is possible to read its status by also setting it as an input pin 
at the same time. 
 
Internal Reference 
The SGM90509 has an on-chip 2.5V reference. The internal 
reference is powered off by default. To enable the internal 
reference, the bit D9 is set in the power-down and reference 
control register (refer to Table 18). 
 
Temperature Sensor 
The SGM90509 has an integrated temperature sensor that 
can be used to estimate the temperature of die. The 
temperature conversion time is 3μs, whether the ADC buffer 
is enabled or not. To enable the temperature sampling, set 
the bit D8 in the ADC sequence register (refer to Table 10). 
Calculation of the temperature is shown below:  
When ADC gain = 1: 
 
×
×
REF
REF
(ADC Code - (0.56/V
) 
 4095)
Temperature(
) = 25 + 
(3.015 
 (2.5/V
℃
))
(2)
 
When ADC gain = 2: 
×
×
×
REF
REF
(ADC Code - (0.56/(2 
 V
)) 
 4095)
Temperature(
) = 25 + 
(1.508 
 (2.5/V
℃
))
(3)
 
The codes range returned by the ADC is approximately 721 to 
1219, and its temperature range is from -40℃ to +125℃.  
 
Serial Interface 
The SGM90509 has an SPI-compatible interface. Please 
refer to Table 2 for the input shift register in 16-bit format. The 
control register maps are shown in Table 3.

Power-Up Time 
When the system is power-on or there is a reset operation, it 
will take SGM90509 250μs to power up, it is not suggested to 
do any operation during this time. 
 
Write Mode 
Figure 1 shows the read and write timing for the SGM90509. 
A falling edge of nSYNC starts a write frame. Data is locked 
on the falling edge of SCLK. After 16 falling edges of SCLK, 
all 16-bit data is shifted in. Then nSYNC can be pulled high. 
Read Mode 
The SGM90509 supports data readback from the ADCs and 
control registers. ADC conversion result will be shifted out 
automatically when there is an operation on the chip. To read 
out a register, it is necessary to issue a write to the Readback 
and LDAC Mode register firstly to select which register to 
read back. Then the selected register content will be read out 
on the next nSYNC frame with 16 clocks falling edge.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Configuring the SGM90509 
In order for the SGM90509 to work in the target state, a series 
of configuration registers need to be set. After power-up, the 
SGM90509 I/O pins are configured as 85kΩ resistors 
connected to GND by default. The I/O pins can be software 
re-configured as DAC outputs, ADC inputs, digital outputs, 
digital inputs, three-state, or connected to GND with 85kΩ 
pull-down resistors. The configuration operating can be 
issued at any time, when there is no any ADC conversion is 
on-going or a register is being read back. The lock 
configuration bit must also be 0 before a configuration is 
issued.

Power-Down and Reference Control 
The SGM90509 has a power-down and reference control register, and it can power down the internal reference and DACs (see 
Table 18). There is no dedicated power-down function for the ADC, but the ADC is automatically powered down if there is no an 
ADC operation.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Reset Function 
The SGM90509 can be reset by setting the reset register (pointer byte = 0b00001111). This operation resets all registers to their 
default values.

Readback and LDAC Mode Register 
The input register of each DAC can be read back via the SPI interface. The data can be read back from a DAC only when there is 
no ADC conversion sequence.

LDAC Mode[1:0] 
Determines how data written to an input register of a DAC is handled. 
00 = Data written to an input register is immediately copied to a DAC register, and the 
DAC output updates (default) 
01 = Data written to an input register is not copied to a DAC register. The DAC output is 
not updated 
10 = Data in the input registers is copied to the corresponding DAC registers. When the 
data has been transferred, the DAC outputs are updated simultaneously
