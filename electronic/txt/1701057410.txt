OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
The SGM2217Q is a low noise, high current and low 
dropout LDO and provides 1.5A output current. These 
features make the device a reliable solution to solve 
many challenging problems in the generation of clean 
and accurate power supply. The high performance also 
makes the SGM2217Q useful in a variety of 
applications. The SGM2217Q provides protection 
functions for output overload, output short-circuit 
condition and overheating. 
 
Input Capacitor Selection (CIN) 
The input decoupling capacitor should be placed as 
close as possible to the IN pin for ensuring the device 
stability. 10μF or larger X7R or X5R ceramic capacitor 
is selected to get good dynamic performance. 
When VIN is required to provide large current 
instantaneously, a large effective input capacitor is 
required. Multiple input capacitors can limit the input 
tracking inductance. Adding more input capacitors is 
available to restrict the ringing and to keep it below the 
device absolute maximum ratings. 
 
Output Capacitor Selection (COUT) 
The output decoupling capacitor should be placed as 
close as possible to the OUT pin. It is recommended to 
use output capacitor with effective capacitance in the 
range of 2.3μF to 100μF with an ESR of 8Ω or less. For 
ceramic capacitor, temperature, DC bias and package 
size will change the effective capacitance, so enough 
margin of COUT must be considered in design. 
Additionally, COUT with larger capacitance and lower 
ESR will help increase the high frequency PSRR and 
improve the load transient response. 
 
Output Current Limit and Short-Circuit 
Protection 
The current limiting circuit reduces the output current 
as the input-to-output differential increases after 2ms of 
power-on. The current limit is reduced from 2.9A to 0.26A 
when the VIN - VOUT voltage is greater than about 20V. 
 
Adjustable Regulator 
The output voltage of the SGM2217Q can be adjusted 
from 1.25V to 26V. The ADJ pin will be connected to two 
external resistors as shown in Figure 3. 
The PSRR and noise of adjustable LDO circuit can be 
modified slightly to levels close to that of the unity-gain 
LDO. The adjustment terminal can be bypassed to 
ground with a capacitor (CADJ). The impedance of the 
CADJ should be equal to or less than R2 at the desired 
frequency.

Thermal Shutdown 
When the die temperature exceeds the threshold value 
of thermal shutdown, the SGM2217Q will be in 
shutdown state and it will remain in this state until the 
die temperature decreases to +160℃. 
 
Power Dissipation (PD) 
Power dissipation (PD) of the SGM2217Q can be 
calculated by the equation PD = (VIN - VOUT) × IOUT. The 
maximum allowable power dissipation (PD(MAX)) of the 
SGM2217Q is affected by many factors, including the 
difference between junction temperature and ambient 
temperature (TJ(MAX) - TA), package thermal resistance 
from the junction to the ambient environment (θJA), the 
rate of ambient airflow and PCB layout. PD(MAX) can be 
approximated by the following equation:  
PD(MAX) = (TJ(MAX) - TA)/θJA               (1)
