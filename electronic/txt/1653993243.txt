DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
Operation 
The SGM6607 is a non-synchronous Boost converter 
with integrated low-side power FET, capable of 
delivering up to 38V DC output. The SGM6607 adopts 
the peak current mode control architecture with fixed 
1.2MHz switching frequency. A slope ramp is added to 
the sensed peak current ramp to avoid sub-harmonic 
oscillation at operation duty cycle higher than 40%. The 
error amplifier compares the FB pin voltage with an 
internal reference signal to provide an error signal for 
the PWM comparator to adjust the duty cycle which 
ultimately regulates the output voltage to the desired 
voltage. At the beginning of each clock cycle, the PWM 
comparator turns on the low-side (LS) FET to ramp up 
the inductor current. As the inductor current reaches 
the level set by the error amplifier’s output, the LS FET 
turns off, which causes the external Schottky diode to 
be forward biased to ramp down the inductor current 
which delivers the energy to the load as well as 
replenishes the output capacitor. 
 
Soft-Start 
The SGM6607 implements the internal soft-start 
feature to reduce the inrush current drawn during 
start-up. When the voltage applied on VIN pin is higher 
than 3V and a logic high is applied on the EN pin, the 
SGM6607 starts operation and ramps up the reference 
voltage to 1.211V in 2ms. The 2ms soft-start time 
ensures the output voltage to ramp slowly, which 
effectively reduces the inrush current during start-up. 
 
Over-Current Protection 
The peak current mode control of SGM6607 provides 
inherent over-current protection. The LS FET is turned 
off when the peak current reaches the current limit 
threshold of 1.1A (TYP), and the LS FET is not turned 
on again until the next clock cycle.  
 
Under-Voltage Lockout (UVLO) 
The SGM6607 implements input under-voltage lockout 
feature. When the input voltage falls below the falling 
threshold of 2.2V (TYP), the SGM6607 stops switching 
and turns off the internal FET.  
 
Over-Voltage Protection (OVP) 
Over-voltage protection circuitry prevents IC damage 
due to output resistor divider disconnection. The 
SGM6607 monitors the voltage at the SW pin during 
each switching cycle. The circuitry turns off the switch 
FET and shuts down the IC when the following 
condition persists for 8 switching clock cycles: the SW 
voltage exceeds the VOVP threshold. As a result, the 
output voltage falls to the level of the input supply. The 
device remains in shutdown mode until it is enabled by 
toggling the EN pin logic or its power input falls below 
UVLO. The VOVP threshold of SGM6607 is set at 41V. 
It might cause false over-voltage protection if the load 
voltage stays high when the device is enabled while the 
VIN is close to UVLO, in which the internal reference for 
the OVP comparator ramps more slowly and stays too 
low after an OVP blanking time of around 100μs. If the 
false protection happens, the SGM6607 stops. Enable 
this device when VIN > 3V or after the load voltage 
discharges to avoid false protection. 
 
Thermal Shutdown 
A thermal shutdown function is implemented to prevent 
damage caused by excessive heat and power 
dissipation. Once a junction temperature of +150℃
(TYP) is exceeded, the device is shut down. The device 
is released from shutdown automatically when the 
junction temperature decreases by 15℃. 
 
Enable and Shutdown 
The SGM6607 implements the EN function to turn 
on/off the device. A logic signal higher than 1.5V turns 
on the device, and logic signal lower than 0.4V turns off 
the device. The EN pin integrates an internal 500kΩ 
(TYP) pull-down resistor to prevent the device from 
false turn-on when the EN pin is left floating.

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
Program Output Voltage 
The output voltage of SGM6607 is configured via a 
resistive divider connected to the FB pin. Use Equation 
1 to program the output voltage. R1 is the top feedback 
resistor and R2 is the bottom feedback resistor.

        (1) 
Due to the leakage current of the resistor divider, the 
resistance of R2 should be no less than 10kΩ. 
 
Switch Duty Cycle 
The Boost converter’s duty cycle determines the Boost 
ratio 
available 
for 
the 
device. 
The 
SGM6607 
implements maximum switch duty cycle (D) of 94% 
(TYP), the duty cycle and input/output voltage 
relationship is shown in Equation 2. Care should be 
taken to ensure that the maximum duty cycle limit is not 
reached.

The SGM6607 also implements minimum on-time of 
80ns (TYP), which is related to minimum duty cycle. In 
light 
load 
condition, 
the 
SGM6607 
enters 
pulse-skipping mode, and the device operates with 
minimum duty cycle in this mode. 
 
Inductor Selection 
Inductor is an essential element for current DC/DC 
switch mode power supplies regardless of topology. 
Inductor serves as the energy storage element for 
power conversion. Inductance and saturation current of 
inductor are two most important criterions for inductor 
selection. For general design guidance, the selected 
inductance should provide a peak to peak ripple current 
that is around 30% of the average inductor current at 
full load and nominal input voltage. The average 
inductor current for a Boost converter is the input 
current. Equation 3 shows the calculation of inductance 
selection, where fSW is the switching frequency and ΔIL 
is the inductor ripple current.

The selected inductor should have a saturation current 
rating higher than the 1.1A (TYP) current limit of 
SGM6607. 
The inductor also affects the close loop response of the 
DC/DC converter. The recommended inductor ranges 
from 6.8µH to 22µH. Since the SGM6607 implements 
built-in slope compensation to prevent sub-harmonic 
oscillation, inductance lower than 6.8µH might results 
in insufficient slope compensation, which ultimately 
results in unstable operation. 
 
Compensation Capacitor Selection 
The control loop’s compensation is done externally on 
SGM6607, which provides design flexibility for various 
input and output voltage combinations. A series RC 
connected on the COMP pin forms a pole and zero, in 
addition to the inherent pole of current mode control, 
set the close loop frequency response of SGM6607. 
Equations 
4 
to 
8 
indicate 
the 
calculation 
of 
corresponding poles and zeros of Boost frequency 
response. Equation 4 presents the dominant pole 
formed with CCOMP. Equation 5 presents the output load 
pole, where ROUT is the equivalent load resistance. 
Equation 6 presents the right half plane zero, the 
designed loop response cross over frequency should 
be less than 1/5th of the right half plane zero frequency 
to ensure enough phase margin at cross over 
frequency. Equation 7 presents the phase Boost zero. 
Lastly, Equation 8 presents the DC gain of the system, 
where GEA can be found in the Electrical Characteristics 
table, RSENSE is 200mΩ.

Schottky Diode Selection 
The external rectification diode selection is critical to 
ensure device performance. A high speed and low 
forward voltage drop diode is recommended to improve 
efficiency. The average current rating of the diode 
should be higher than the peak load. The breakdown 
voltage of the selected diode should be higher than the 
programmed output voltage with margin, for example, a 
12V output application requires a minimal of 20V 
breakdown voltage.  
 
Input and Output Capacitor Selection 
The output capacitors of Boost converter dictate the 
output voltage ripple and load transient response. 
Equation 9 is used to estimate the necessary 
capacitance to achieve desired output voltage ripple, 
where ΔV is the maximum allowed ripple.

The recommended output capacitor ranges from 1µF to 
10µF. Due to the DC bias nature of ceramic capacitors, 
care should be taken by verifying manufacture’s 
datasheet to ensure enough effective capacitance at 
desired output voltage. 
Boost converter’s input capacitor has continuous 
current throughout the entire switching cycle, a 4.7µF 
ceramic capacitor is recommended to place as close as 
possible between the VIN pin and GND pin of the 
device. For applications where the SGM6607 is located 
far away from the input source, a 47µF or higher 
capacitance capacitor is recommended to damp the 
wiring harness inductance.
