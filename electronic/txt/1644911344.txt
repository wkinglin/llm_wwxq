GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM5349-16 is a 16-bit, 8 channels, voltage- 
output digital-to-analog converter (DAC). The chips are 
guaranteed monotonic by design. 
The chips have a power-on control circuit, which can 
make sure DAC has a fixed output when system is 
powered on. The SGM5349A-16 outputs 0V when 
system powers up. The SGM5349M-16 outputs 
midscale when system powers up. 
The chips have an nLDAC pin which can let DAC 
update outputs simultaneously.  
The chips have an nCLR pin which can let DAC update 
to a configurable state, zero-code, midscale, or 
full-scale. 
The SGM5349-16 uses a 3-wire SPI-compatible 
interface, and its operation data rate is up to 50MHz. 
The SGM5349-16 is available in Green TSSOP-16 and 
TQFN-4×4-16L packages. 
FEATURES 
● Power Supply Range: 2.7V to 5.5V 
● Power Down to 1μA at 5.5V 
● Monotonicity Guaranteed by Design 
● Power-On Reset to Zero-Scale or Midscale 
● 3 Power-Down Modes 
● Hardware nLDAC Function 
● nCLR Function to Programmable Code 
● Rail-to-Rail Buffered Voltage-Output Operation 
● Available in Green TSSOP-16 and TQFN-4×4-16L

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.

Where:  
D = Equal decimal value is 0 to 65535.  
N = 16. 
 
Internal Reference 
The chip has no internal reference. 
 
Output Amplifier 
The output buffer amplifier is rail-to-rail output. 
 
Serial Interface 
The SGM5349-16 has a 3-wire SPI-compatible interface. 
For detail operation timing sequence, please see Figure 1. To 
prepare a new write sequence, nSYNC must be brought high 
for a minimum of 15ns before the new write sequence so that 
a falling edge of nSYNC can initiate the new write sequence.  
 
Input Shift Register 
The input shift register is a 32-bit data. The first 4-bit 
DB[31:28] is don’t care. The second 4-bit DB[27:24] is 
command bit C3 to C0 (see Table 1). The meaning of left bits 
is different with commands. 
If C3 to C0 are DAC output data updating associated, the 
third 4-bit DB[23:20] is DAC address bit A3 to A0 (see Table 
2). And the following 16-bit DB[19:4] is the DAC data bit. The 
final 4-bit DB[3:0] is not used data bit (See Figure 4). 
If C3 to C0 are power-down/power-up associated, please 
refer to Table 4. 
If C3 to C0 are clear function code, please refer to Table 6. 
If C3 to C0 are load DAC function, please refer to Table 8. 
All 32-bit data are locked into the input register on the 32nd 
falling edge of SCLK.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
nSYNC Interrupt 
In a normal write sequence, the nSYNC line must be kept low 
for at least 32 falling edges of SCLK and the DAC is updated 
on the 32nd falling edge. However, if nSYNC goes high before 
the 32nd falling edge, this write operation is invalid and 
ignored. An example is shown in Figure 5. 
 
Power-On Reset 
The SGM5349A-16 resets to 0V output when chip powers up. 
The SGM5349M-16 resets to midscale output when chip 
powers up. 
There is a software reset which can perform same DAC reset 
function. And during reset, any nLDAC and nCLR operation is 
invalid. 
 
Power-Down Modes 
The SGM5349-16 has 3 power-down modes. 
Table 3 shows these power-down modes configurations. And 
the operation data format is shown in Table 4. In Table 4, 
some or all DACs can be powered down to selected modes 
by setting according bits to ‘1’. 
To exit power-down, configure target DAC channels to normal 
operation mode.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Clear Code Register 
The nCLR pin can be used to set the DAC register and output 
asynchronously. The nCLR status is set in clear code register 
(See Table 5). 
To set clear register, please refer to command format in Table 
6. 
A full valid writes operation can call the chip exiting clear code 
mode.

nLDAC Function 
There are two ways of updating DAC output by using 
hardware nLDAC pin.  
The first way is that we can tie nLDAC pin low or keep it low 
for a while (specified in Figure 1), and after a full write 
command performing, the DAC is updated at the falling edge 
of the 32nd SCLK. 
The second way is that keep nLDAC high during the 32-bit 
writing sequence, then a pulse of nLDAC is given (See Figure 
1), DAC output is updated asynchronously. 
There are also software ways to control DAC update, which 
are equal to nLDAC pin operation. Please refer to Table 7 and 
Table 8.  
In Table 8, when the according DAC channel bit is set to '1', 
DAC output load mode is determined by nLDAC pin operation. 
When according DAC channel bit is set to '0', it is equal to 
nLDAC connected to low, and DAC updated at the falling 
edge of the 32nd SCLK.
