GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM7229X is a DPDT (double-pole/double-throw) 
analog switch. It operates from a 1.8V to 5.5V single 
power supply. Each switch of the SGM7229X is 
bidirectional, which can ensure that the high speed 
signals have little or no attenuation at the outputs. 
Other features include high speed, low bit-to-bit skew 
and wide bandwidth. These high performances make it 
very suitable for multiple applications, such as cellular 
phones and computer peripherals, etc. 
The 
SGM7229X 
has 
power-off 
and 
power-on 
protections. Because of the special circuitry on the 
D+/D- pins, the device will not be damaged even if VBUS 
short-circuit occurs during data transmission. In 
addition, it can prevent accidental from leaking and 
ensure system reliability under power-down and 
over-voltage conditions. 
The SGM7229X is available in Green MSOP-10 and 
UTQFN-1.8×1.4-10L packages. It operates over an 
ambient temperature range of -40℃ to +125℃. 
FEATURES 
● Single Supply Voltage Range: 1.8V to 5.5V 
● On-Resistance: 6Ω (TYP) at 3V 
● High Off-Isolation: -26dB (RL = 50Ω, f = 250MHz) 
● Low Crosstalk: -20dB (RL = 50Ω, f = 250MHz) 
● -3dB Bandwidth: 850MHz 
● Fast Switching Times at VCC = 3.3V: 
tON = 30ns 
tOFF = 18ns 
● Break-Before-Make Switching 
● Rail-to-Rail Input and Output Operation 
● Power-Off and Power-On Protections 
● -40℃ to +125℃ Operating Temperature Range 
● Available in Green UTQFN-1.8×1.4-10L and 
MSOP-10 Packages

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.
