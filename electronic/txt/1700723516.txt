GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The 74HC541 is an octal buffer/line driver with 3-state 
outputs, which can accept supply voltage range from 
2.0V to 5.5V. 
The 3-state control gate is a two-input AND gate with 
active low inputs. OE

ത2 are two output enable 
inputs. When OE
ത

ത2 is 
high, all outputs are in high-impedance state. 
The74HC541 is available in a Green TSSOP-20 package. 
It operates over an ambient temperature range of -40℃ 
to +125℃.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
1. Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may 
affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
2. The input and output negative voltage ratings may be 
exceeded if the input and output clamp current ratings are 
observed. 
3. The performance capability of a high-performance integrated 
circuit in conjunction with its thermal environment can create 
junction temperatures which are detrimental to reliability. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.
