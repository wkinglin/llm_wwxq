DECEMBER2022–REV.A.1 
 
GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The Micro-Point-of-Load (µPOL) SGM61013 is a family 
of high-efficient and high-frequency Buck DC/DC 
converter. Operating with a switching frequency up to 
10MHz, it allows the use of small external components 
in both value and footprint. Different versions are 
available with fixed output voltages of 1.2V, 1.8V and 
3.3V, delivered from an input voltage supply of 2.3V to 
5.5V. A low quiescent current of only 20µA (TYP) 
enables high efficiency even with very light loads. 
At light current load condition, the converter will 
automatically enter pulse frequency modulation (PFM) 
mode for best possible efficiency over the entire range 
of load currents. If PFM mode is not desired, the MODE 
pin can be set high to forced pulse width modulation 
(FPWM) operation. 
The 
SGM61013 
is 
available 
in 
a 
Green 
WLCSP-0.9×1.2-6B package.

NOTE: 
1. VIN above 5.5V over extended periods may affect device 
reliability. 
OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
The SGM61013 family is synchronous Buck DC/DC 
converters with switching frequency up to 10MHz. 
Operating from an input voltage between 2.3V and 5.5V, 
the converter can deliver up to 1A load current at a 
fixed output voltage. 
Under-Voltage Lockout (UVLO) 
The under-voltage lockout feature prevents the device 
from turning on if VIN is below the UVLO level of 2.0V. If 
the device is enabled under UVLO conditions, the 
circuitry will not turn on until the input voltage is 
increased. Once it is active, the UVLO circuit has 
150mV of hysteresis and the device will turn off if VIN 
drops below 1.85V. 
Enable 
Setting the EN voltage to logic high enables the device. 
Alternatively, the device is disabled when the EN 
voltage is set to logic low. In this state, the IC draws 
less than 1µA of current and the output is pulled down 
to ground through a resistive load (RDSON). VOUT starts 
to ramp up after 100µs delay. 
Soft-Start 
When the device is enabled, internal soft-start circuitry 
causes VOUT to ramp up over a period of 280µs to limit 
inrush current. This feature protects a high impedance 
source from being pulled to a lower voltage as the 
device turns on. 
Active Output Discharge 
When the device is disabled through the EN pin, a 
discharge path for the output capacitor is created 
between VOUT and ground through a 17Ω resistor (RDIS). 
Modes of Operation 
The MODE pin selects the device’s mode of operation. 
When connected to logic high, the converter always 
operates in pulse width modulation (PWM) mode 
regardless of load current. The PWM mode is a 
continuous switching mode where the duty cycle is 
modulated to achieve the required output power. 
When 
connected 
to 
logic 
low, 
the 
converter 
automatically switches to pulse frequency modulation 
(PFM) mode at light current loads. In PFM mode the 
frequency of pulses is varied to deliver the best 
possible efficiency. The device switches between PFM 
and PWM as the load current changes and thus 
optimizes performance. 
If the input voltage ever gets too close to the target 
output voltage, such that regulation can no longer be 
maintained, the converter will enter 100% duty cycle 
mode. In this mode the high-side switch is on, 
connecting the input and output together to deliver a 
voltage as close to the target as possible. 
Over-Current Protection 
The device has an over-current protection to prevent 
damage to the device and inductor during over-current 
conditions. 
Over-current protection occurs at 1.6A. After hitting 16 
consecutive cycles of peak current limit, the output will 
be disabled. After being disabled for 1.5ms, the device 
will be re-enabled, and a new soft-start cycle will begin. 
Thermal Shutdown 
The device thermal shutdown protection is enabled if 
the chip temperature exceeds +135 ℃. Once the 
temperature drops below +120℃, the device will be 
re-enabled, and a new soft-start cycle will begin.

Layout Guidelines and Example 
A well-designed and manufactured PCB is important for 
all switching power supplies, especially for those 
operate at high switching frequency. 
Poor layout could result in system instability, EMI failure, 
and device damage. Hence, care must be taken in 
board layout to achieve the specified performance. 
Please use the following guidelines when designing 
PCBs: 
● Keep components placement as compact as 
possible. 
● Place a low-ESR input capacitor as close to VIN and 
GND as possible. 
● Minimize the area between SW pin trace and inductor 
to limit high frequency radiation. 
● Keep FB trace away from noisy components and 
traces (e.g. SW and inductor). 
● Use wide and short traces for the main current paths. 
● Ground pins of converter must be strongly 
connected to PCB ground with low inductance and 
impedance. 
● Place common and unbroken ground for CIN and 
COUT. 
● Reduce excessive thermal relief vias and keep them 
away from SW and inductor.
