GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM2041 is an ultra-low noise and low dropout 
voltage linear regulator. It is capable of supplying 
300mA output current with typical dropout voltage of 
only 50mV. The operating input voltage range is from 
1.6V to 5.5V and output voltage range is from 0.75V to 
4.35V. 
Other features include logic-controlled shutdown mode, 
short-circuit current limit and thermal shutdown 
protection. The SGM2041 has automatic discharge 
function to quickly discharge VOUT in the disabled status. 
The SGM2041 is suitable for applications which need 
low noise and fast transient response power supply, 
such as power supply of camera module in smart 
phone, etc. 
The SGM2041 is available in an ultra-thin Green 
WLCSP-0.64×0.64-4B-A package. It operates over an 
operating temperature range of -40℃ to +125℃.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.

PIN DESCRIPTION 
PIN 
NAME 
FUNCTION 
A1 
IN 
Input Supply Voltage Pin. It is recommended to use a 1μF or larger ceramic capacitor from 
IN pin to ground to get good power supply decoupling. This ceramic capacitor should be 
placed as close as possible to IN pin. 
A2 
OUT 
Regulator Output Pin. It is recommended to use a ceramic capacitor with effective 
capacitance in the range of 0.5μF to 10μF to ensure stability. This ceramic capacitor should 
be placed as close as possible to OUT pin. 
B1 
EN 
Enable Pin. Drive EN high to turn on the regulator. Drive EN low to turn off the regulator. 
The EN pin has an internal 0.2μA pull-down current source which ensures that the device is 
turned off when the EN pin is floated. 
B2 
GND 
Ground.

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
The SGM2041 is an ultra-low noise and low dropout 
LDO and provides 300mA output current. These 
features make the device a reliable solution to solve 
many challenging problems in the generation of clean 
and accurate power supply. The high performance also 
makes the SGM2041 useful in a variety of applications. 
The SGM2041 provides the protection functions for 
output overload, output short-circuit condition and 
overheating. 
The SGM2041 provides an EN pin as an external chip 
enable control to enable/disable the device. When the 
regulator is in shutdown state, the shutdown current 
consumes as low as 0.03μA (TYP). 
 
Input Capacitor Selection (CIN) 
The input decoupling capacitor should be placed as 
close as possible to the IN pin for ensuring the device 
stability. 1μF or larger X7R or X5R ceramic capacitor is 
selected to get good dynamic performance. 
When VIN is required to provide large current 
instantaneously, a large effective input capacitor is 
required. Multiple input capacitors can limit the input 
tracking inductance. Adding more input capacitors is 
available to restrict the ringing and to keep it below the 
device absolute maximum ratings. 
 
Output Capacitor Selection (COUT) 
The output capacitor should be placed as close as 
possible to the OUT pin. 1μF or larger X7R or X5R 
ceramic capacitor is selected to get good dynamic 
performance. The minimum effective capacitance of 
COUT that SGM2041 can remain stable is 0.5μF. For 
ceramic capacitor, temperature, DC bias and package 
size will change the effective capacitance, so enough 
margin of COUT must be considered in design. 
Additionally, COUT with larger capacitance and lower 
ESR will help increase the high frequency PSRR and 
improve the load transient response. 
 
Enable Operation 
The EN pin of the SGM2041 is used to enable/disable 
its device and to deactivate/activate the output 
automatic discharge function. 
When the EN pin voltage is lower than 0.6V, the device 
is in shutdown state, there is no current flowing from IN 
to OUT pins. In this state, the automatic discharge 
transistor is active to discharge the output voltage 
through a 255Ω (TYP) resistor. 
When the EN pin voltage is higher than 1V, the device 
is in active state, the output voltage is regulated to 
expected value and the automatic discharge transistor 
is turned off. 
The EN pin is pulled down by internal 0.03μA (TYP) 
current source when the EN pin is floated. This current 
source will ensure the SGM2041 in shutdown state and 
reduce the power dissipation in system. 
 
Reverse Current Protection 
The PMOS power transistor has an inherent body 
diode. This body diode will be forward biased when 
VOUT > VIN. When VOUT > VIN, the reverse current 
flowing from the OUT pin to the IN pin will damage the 
SGM2041V. If VOUT > VIN event would happen in 
system, one external diode will be added between OUT 
pin and IN pin in circuit design to protect the 
SGM2041V.

Negatively Biased Output 
When the output voltage is negative, the chip may not 
start up due to parasitic effects. Ensure that the output 
is greater than -0.3V under all conditions. If negatively 
biased output is excessive and expected in the 
application, a Schottky diode can be added between 
the OUT pin and GND pin.

APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued) 
Output Current Limit and Short-Circuit 
Protection 
When overload events happen, the output current is 
internally limited to 580mA (TYP). When the OUT pin is 
shorted to ground, the short-circuit protection will limit 
the output current to 360mA (TYP). 
 
Thermal Shutdown 
The SGM2041 can detect the temperature of die. When 
the die temperature exceeds the threshold value of 
thermal shutdown, the SGM2041 will be in shutdown 
state and it will remain in this state until the die 
temperature decreases to +140℃. 
 
Power Dissipation (PD) 
Thermal protection limits power dissipation in the 
SGM2041. When power dissipation on pass element 
(PD = (VIN - VOUT) × IOUT) is too much and the operating 
junction temperature exceeds +160℃, the OTP circuit 
starts the thermal shutdown function and turns the pass 
element off. 
Therefore, thermal analysis for the chosen application is 
important to guarantee reliable performance over all 
conditions. To guarantee reliable operation, the junction 
temperature of the SGM2041 must not exceed +125℃. 
The maximum allowable power dissipation depends on 
the thermal resistance of the IC package, the PCB 
layout, the rate of surrounding airflow, and the 
difference between the junction temperature and 
ambient temperature. The maximum power dissipation 
can be approximated using the following equation: 
PD(MAX) = (TJ(MAX) - TA)/θJA             (1) 
where TJ(MAX) is the maximum junction temperature, TA 
is 
the 
ambient 
temperature, 
and 
θJA 
is 
the 
junction-to-ambient thermal resistance.
