GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM61184 is an efficient 18V, 8A synchronous 
Buck DC/DC converter with integrated power MOSFETs 
and a wide 4.5V to 18V input range. This current mode 
control device is optimized for high density applications 
with minimal number of external components. High 
switching frequency, up to 1600kHz, can be chosen to 
lessen the solution size by smaller inductor and 
capacitors. 
The peak current mode control with fast transient 
response makes the loop compensation simple. The 
high-side MOSFET current and low-side MOSFET 
sourcing current are cycle-by-cycle limited for overload 
protection. The hiccup mode limits MOSFET power 
dissipation if short-circuit or overload keeps appearing. 
A power good supervisor circuit monitors the regulator 
output. When the output voltage is in regulation, the PG 
open-drain output pin will be in high-impedance state. 
An internal deglitch time prevents this pin from pulling 
low unless a fault has occurred. The EN pin can be 
used to adjust the input UVLO and hysteresis by a 
resistor divider. The soft-start and tracking pin (SS/TRK) 
can control the output voltage start-up ramp, which 
makes the device work as a standalone power supply 
or work in tracking situations.  
The SGM61184 is available in a Green TQFN-3.5×3.5- 
18AL package.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
Overview 
The SGM61184 is a 4.5V to 18V, 8A, synchronous 
Buck converter with integrated high-side and low-side 
MOSFETs. The minimum achievable output voltage of 
this converter is 0.6V, which is equal to the device 
internal reference voltage (VREF). 
As a constant frequency, peak current mode control 
device, SGM61184 can provide fast transient response 
with a simple compensation circuit. The wide switching 
frequency is adjustable from 200kHz to 1600kHz to 
allow optimizing of the efficiency and size of the 
converter. 
For 
adjusting 
the 
internal 
switching 
frequency, an external resistor RRT is connected 
between the RT/CLK pin and GND. The device also 
accepts an external clock source on this pin to 
synchronize the oscillator using the internal phase 
locked loop (PLL).  
This device can have a safe and monotonic start-up in 
output pre-biased conditions. The VIN must exceed the 
under-voltage lockout threshold (UVLO, 4.05V TYP) for 
device power-up. The UVLO thresholds can be 
adjusted (increased) by connecting the EN pin to the 
tap point of a resistor divider between the VIN pin and 
GND. The EN internal pull-up current source and the 
resistor divider determine the UVLO thresholds. When 
the EN is floated or is pulled high, the device is enabled 
and the total device current (no switching) is near 
950μA. Pulling the EN pin low will shut down the device 
with 3.5μA (TYP) supply current. 
The integrated MOSFETs are optimized for higher 
efficiency at lower duty cycles. They can efficiently 
provide up to 8A continuous output current. The 
integrated bootstrap circuit along with the external boot 
capacitor provides the bias voltage for the high-side 
MOSFET driver. The voltage of the bootstrap capacitor 
that is placed between the BOOT and SW pins is 
continuously monitored for bootstrap UVLO (BOOT-SW 
UVLO) detection. If the boot capacitor voltage drops 
below the bootstrap UVLO, the SW pin will be pulled 
low to recharge the boot capacitor. 100% duty cycle 
operation is possible as long as the boot capacitor 
voltage is higher than the 2.5V (TYP) threshold (preset 
UVLO level). 
The device contains a power good (PG) pin which 
indicates the status of the output voltage by comparing 
the FB voltage and the internal reference voltage. PG 
pin is connected to the drain of internal MOSFET. The 
PG signal is high when VOUT is between 91% and 106% 
of its nominal (set) value and goes low if VOUT drops 
below 89% or rises above 108% of its nominal value. 
The SS/TRK (soft-start/tracking) pin can be used to 
minimize the inrush currents (soft-start function) with a 
small value capacitor, or for power supply sequencing 
during power-up with a resistor divider from preceding 
voltage rail. It is the input pin for the voltage that is 
followed by the output when the power supply is used 
in the tracking mode. 
The SGM61184 is protected from output over-voltage, 
over-current and over-heating damage. The output 
over-voltage transients are effectively minimized by the 
over-voltage comparator of the power good circuit. 
When an over-voltage occurs, the high-side switch is 
forced off and allowed to turn on again if the VOUT drops 
below 106% of its nominal value. 
High-side MOSFET is naturally protected from sourcing 
over-current by peak current mode control. The 
low-side MOSFET is also protected bidirectionally 
against over-current. This feature helps the control of 
the inductor current to avoid current run away. 
If a die temperature is too high (TJ > TSD), the device 
will stop switching and go into shutdown state. It will 
automatically recover with a soft-start when the junction 
temperature drops 15℃ (TYP) below the shutdown 
temperature. 
Note that a continued overload condition may cause a 
cycling thermal shutdown and recovery. It will depend 
on the temperature and the ventilation conditions of the 
system.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Power Input Pins 
The VIN pin supplies the internal circuits of the device 
as well as it also provides the supply voltage for the 
power switches. The VIN operates between 4.5V and 
18V, and a voltage divider connected to the EN pin from 
either VIN pin can be used to adjust the power supply 
UVLO.  
 
EN Pin and UVLO Programming 
The EN pin is used to turn the device on and off. The 
device starts operation when the EN voltage rises 
above the enable rising threshold. Pulling the EN 
voltage below the enable falling threshold stops 
switching and reduces the device current to the very 
low quiescent shutdown level. Floating the EN pin will 
enable the device due to its internal pull-up current 
source. This current source is used for programming 
the UVLO threshold. An open-drain or open-collector 
output connected to the EN pin can be used to control 
the device. An internal UVLO circuit is implemented on 
the VIN pin to disable the device and prevent 
malfunction when the supply voltage is too low. The 
internal VIN_UVLO hysteresis is 200mV. To program a 
higher UVLO threshold for the VIN, the EN pin can be 
configured to one of the configurations shown in Figure 
3. Without external components, the internal pull-up 
current (IP) sets the EN pin default state to enable. 
When the device is enabled, the second current source 
(IH) is activated. IP and IH are used to set the UVLO.

thresholds.

Soft-Start (SS/TRK) 
The lower voltage between the internal VREF and the 
SS/TRK pins is used as the reference to regulate the 
output. The soft-start capacitor is connected to the 
SS/TRK pin and is charged by a 4.7μA internal current 
source to set the soft-start time (tSS).

Start-Up with Pre-Biased Output 
The low-side switch is prohibited from turning on and 
discharging the output if a pre-biased voltage is sensed 
on the output before start-up. As long as the SS/TRK 
pin voltage is below VFB, the low-side switch is not 
allowed to sink current to have a monotonic start-up 
with pre-biased output. 
 
Reference Voltage (VREF) 
A precise 0.6V reference is internally implemented by 
scaling the output of a temperature-stable band-gap 
circuit. The reference voltage tolerance over the whole 
temperature range is ±1.2%. The actual reference 
voltage for output setting is changed during start-up or 
tracking. 
 
Output Voltage Setting 
The output voltage of the device can be adjusted by 
resistors RFB1 and RFB2 which are connected to the FB 
pin. Use resistors with 1% tolerance or better for good 
output accuracy. Equation 4 can be used to calculate 
the RFB1 and RFB2 (upper and lower resistors) values 
based on the desired output voltage (VOUT) and VREF.

where: 
VREF = 0.6V. 
 
For example, a 10kΩ resistor can be chosen for RFB2 
and then RFB1 is calculated. Do not choose so large 
resistors that may cause output errors due to the FB 
bias current or make the regulator susceptible to the 
noises coupled to the FB input. 
The minimal output voltage is determined by the 
minimum on-time of the high-side switch. The maximal 
output voltage is constrained by the bootstrap voltage. 
 
Power Good (PG) 
The PG is an open-drain output. It is released if there is 
no fault and the FB pin voltage is in regulation. The PG 
is pulled low if the FB voltage is lower than 89% or 
above 108% of the reference voltage. When the device 
is disabled by EN pin or the voltage of SS/TRK pin is 
under 1.5V, or if a fault such as UVLO or thermal 
shutdown occurs, PG is also pulled low. 
A 10kΩ to 100kΩ pull-up resistor connected to a 
voltage rail less than 5.5V is recommended for PG. An 
option is using the output voltage for PG pull-up. The 
state of PG is valid only if the VIN > 1.7V. The current 
sinking capability of PG is limited until VIN exceeds the 
4.5V at which the full sinking capacity is available. 
 
Frequency and Synchronization (RT/CLK) 
The device can operate in two modes to adjust 
switching frequency.  
In the RT mode, a resistor (RRT) is placed between the 
RT/CLK and GND pins to set the free running switching 
frequency of the PLL. 
In the CLK mode, an external clock drives the RT/CLK 
pin and the internal switching clock oscillator is 
synchronized to CLK by the PLL. The CLK mode 
overrides the RT mode. The device automatically 
detects the input clock and switches to the CLK mode. 
 
Constant Frequency PWM 
The SGM61184 operates at fixed frequency that can be 
set by an external resistor or synchronized by external 
clock. 
It is based on peak current control mode architecture. 
The high-side MOSFET is turned on until the sensing 
current ramp signal reaches the COMP voltage 
determined by the EA. If the switch current does not 
reach the reference value that generates from the 
COMP voltage at the end of a cycle, the high-side 
switch remains on for the next cycle until the current 
meets the reference value. 
 
Continuous Current Mode (CCM) 
In most load conditions, the device operates in 
continuous conduction mode (CCM) (forced PWM). For 
light loads, the inductor current can be negative when 
the low-side switch is on. However, if the current 
reaches the low-side sinking current limit, the low-side 
switch will be forced off. 
It is based on peak current control mode architecture. 
The high-side MOSFET is turned on until the sensing 
current ramp signal reaches the COMP voltage 
determined by the EA. If the switch current does not 
reach the reference value that generates from the 
COMP voltage at the end of a cycle, the high-side 
switch remains on for the next cycle until the current 
meets the reference value. 
 
Error Amplifier 
The output voltage is sensed by a resistor divider 
through the FB pin and is compared with the internal 
reference. The error amplifier generates an output 
current that is proportional to the voltage difference 
(error), and the transconductance is 1160μA/V. The 
generated current is then fed into the external 
compensation network to generate the voltage on the 
COMP pin, which sets the reference value for the peak 
current that controls the on-time of the power MOSFET. 
COMP is pulled down to the ground when the device 
shuts down.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Slope Compensation 
To avoid sub-harmonic oscillations that result in 
unstable 
PWM 
pulses, 
a 
small 
negative-slope 
compensating ramp is added to the measured switch 
current before it is used to generate the PWM signal. 
The slope compensation has no influence on the peak 
current limit which is maintained over full range of duty 
cycle. 
 
Input Over-Voltage Protection 
The SGM61184 is designed with an input over-voltage 
protection circuit. During normal operation of the chip, 
once the input voltage VIN exceeds about 24.2V, the IC 
stops switching. The high-side and low-side MOSFETs 
both turn off, and the soft-start capacitor discharges. 
Until the input voltage VIN is lower than about 23.8V, the 
OVP state will be released and the device will operate 
again. 
 
Output Over-Voltage Protection (OVP) 
The device contains an over-voltage protection circuit 
to avoid high overshoots of the output voltage during 
operation. Usually an OVP occurs after removal of an 
overload condition. When the output voltage is dropped 
due to a persisting overload, the error amplifier output 
reaches to its maximum and forces the converter to 
provide the maximum output current. Upon removal of 
the overload condition, the regulator output rises 
quickly because the high inductor current charges the 
output capacitor rapidly, especially when COUT is small. 
The error amplifier will respond and re-adjust itself but 
not as fast as the output filter and an overshoot occurs. 
To minimize the overshoots, the device monitors the FB 
pin voltage and compares it to the internal OVP 
threshold. If the threshold is exceeded, the high-side 
MOSFET is turned off to stop feeding current to the 
output, and the low-side MOSFET turns on and rapidly 
discharges the output voltage. When the FB voltage 
drops below the OVP threshold, the high-side MOSFET 
can turn on again in the next cycle. 
 
Over-Current Protection 
Both high-side and low-side switches are protected 
from over-current with cycle-by-cycle current limiting as 
explained in the next two sections. 
 
High-side Switch Over-Current Protection 
Using current mode control, the pulse width (from the 
beginning of the cycle until high-side turn-off) is 
determined by the compensator output voltage (VCOMP 
at COMP pin) in a cycle-by-cycle basis. In each cycle 
the high-side switch current is continuously compared 
with the current set point determined by compensator 
output (VCOMP) and when the high-side current reaches 
to that reference (peak current), the high-side switch is 
turned off. 
 
Low-side MOSFET Over-Current Protection 
The current of the low-side switch is continuously 
monitored while it is turned on. Normally, the low-side 
switch sources current from ground to the load through 
the inductor. Before the beginning of a new cycle, the 
low-side current is compared to its current limit which is 
normally lower than the high-side current limit. Only 
when the low-side source current drops below its 
current limit, the high-side MOSFET will turn on again 
for the new cycle. 
In some operating conditions, the low-side switch sinks 
current from the load to the ground. If the low-side 
sinking current exceeds the typical limit of -3.4A, the 
low-side switch will immediately turn off and both 
switches will not turn on until the end of the cycle. 
 
Thermal shutdown 
To protect the device from damage due to overheating, 
the thermal shutdown feature is implemented to disable 
the device when the die temperature exceeds +175℃ 
(TYP). 
A new power-up sequence is 
initiated 
automatically once the temperature falls below +160℃ 
(15℃ hysteresis, TYP). 
 
Device Functional Modes 
Switching Frequency Setting (RT Mode) 
Selection of the switching frequency is generally a 
tradeoff between the solution size, efficiency, and the 
minimum controllable on-time. The RT resistance can 
be designed from Equation 5.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Synchronization (CLK Mode) 
The device uses an internal phase locked loop (PLL) to 
set or synchronize to an external clock signal with the 
200kHz to 1600kHz range. Mode change from RT 
mode to CLK mode is allowed. 
For stable synchronization, a square wave clock with 
20% to 80% duty cycle must be applied to the RT/CLK 
pin. The logic low and high levels of the clock must be 
below 0.8V and above 2.0V respectively. The switching 
cycle starts with the falling edge of the RT/CLK signal. 
If both RT and CLK modes are needed in an application, 
configuration shown in Figure 5 can be used. The RT 
mode can be overridden by CLK mode when both RRT 
and clock are present. Mode switch occurs when the 
RT/CLK is pulled above 2.0V for the first time. Once 
CLK mode is selected, the PLL is locked to external 
CLK and the RT/CLK pin shifts to a high-impedance 
state. Going back from CLK mode to RT mode is not 
recommended, because by removing clock, the 
switching frequency drops to around 100kHz first 
(waiting for synchronize clock) before recovery to the 
free running frequency that is set by RT resistor. Figure 
6 and Figure 7 show the typical performance for the 
transition from RT mode to CLK mode then back to RT 
mode.

Bootstrap Voltage (BOOT) and Operation with Low 
Dropout (100% Duty Cycle) 
An integrated bootstrap regulator is used for powering 
the high-side MOSFET gate driver. A small 0.1μF 
ceramic capacitor (X5R or X7R grade) with at least 10V 
rating is required between the BOOT and SW pins to 
supply the gate driver. It is recharged from VIN source 
through an internal switch every time the SW goes low. 
Recharge happens when the BOOT pin voltage is less 
than VIN and the BOOT-SW voltage is below the 
required regulation for the high-side gate voltage. The 
SGM61184 has no minimum off-time. It can operate at 
100% duty cycle as long as the BOOT-SW voltage is 
higher than its UVLO threshold (2.5V, TYP). If the 
BOOT-SW voltage drops below its UVLO threshold, the 
high-side switch turns off and the low-side switch turns 
on to recharge the boot capacitor.

Start-Up Sequencing (SS/TRK) 
The SS/TRK, EN and PG pins allow the implementation 
of common power supply sequencing methods. A 
simple sequencing approach is shown in Figure 8 in 
which the right side of SGM61184 device is powered up 
after the left one. The PG of the left device is coupled to 
the EN pin of the right. The right side power supply is 
enabled after the primary supply reaches regulation.

In this example, the second power supply output (VOUT2) 
tracks VOUT1 (the output of the first power supply). By 
proper selection of RSS1 and RSS2, VOUT2 can ramp up 
and reach regulation with the same rate, or a little bit 
faster or slower than VOUT1. Note that VOUT2 is tracking 
VOUT1 and reaches regulation first. Equations 7 and 8 
can be used to calculate the tracking resistors. ∆V is 
the desired VOUT1 - VOUT2 difference when VOUT2 
reaches regulation. ∆V will be positive when VOUT1 
change rate is higher than VOUT2 start-up rate. It will be 
negative if VOUT2 rate is faster. With simultaneous 
sequencing, ∆V is zero. To assure the proper device 
operation, make sure that the selected RSS1 is larger 
than the value given in Equation 9.

Design Requirements 
In this example, a high frequency regulator with 
ceramic output capacitors will be designed using 
SGM61184 and the details will be reviewed. The design 
requirements are typically determined at the system 
level. In this example, the known parameters are 
summarized in Table 1.

Operating Frequency 
Usually the first parameter to design is the switching 
frequency (fSW). Higher switching frequencies allow 
smaller solution size and smaller filter inductors and 
capacitors, and the bandwidth of the converter can be 
increased for faster response. It is also easier to filter 
noises because they also shift to higher frequencies. 
The drawbacks are increased switching and gate 
driving losses that result in lower efficiency and tighter 
thermal limits. Also the duty cycle range and Buck ratio 
will be limited due to the minimum on-time and/or 
off-time limits of the converter. In this design, fSW = 
700kHz is chosen as a tradeoff. From Equation 10, the 
nearest standard resistor for this frequency is R7 = 
69.8kΩ.

Inductor Design 
Equation 11 is conventionally used to calculate the 
output inductance of a Buck converter. Generally, a 
smaller inductor is preferred to allow larger bandwidth 
and smaller size. The ratio of inductor current ripple (∆IL) 
to the maximum output current (IOUT) is represented as 
KIND factor (∆IL/IOUT). The inductor ripple current is 
bypassed and filtered by the output capacitor and the 
inductor DC current is passed to the output. Inductor 
ripple is selected based on a few considerations. The 
peak inductor current (IOUT + ∆IL/2) must have a safe 
margin from the saturation current of the inductor in the 
worst-case conditions especially if a hard-saturation 
core type inductor (such as ferrite) is chosen. During 
power-up with large output capacitor, over-current, 
output shorted or load transient conditions, the actual 
peak current of inductor can be greater than IL_PEAK 
calculated in Equation 14. For peak current mode 
converter, selecting an inductor with saturation current 
above the switch current limit is sufficient. The ripple 
current also affects the output capacitor selection. COUT 
RMS current rating must be higher than the inductor 
RMS ripple. Typically, a 20% to 40% ripple is selected 
(KIND = 0.2 ~ 0.4). Choosing a higher KIND value 
reduces the selected inductance.

For this example, the ripple, RMS, and peak inductor

respectively. 
 
Output Capacitor Design 
Three primary criteria must be considered for design of 
the output capacitor (COUT): (1) the converter pole 
location, (2) the output voltage ripple, (3) the transient 
response to a large change in load current. The 
selected value must satisfy all of them. The desired 
transient response is usually expressed as maximum 
overshoot, 
maximum 
undershoot, 
or 
maximum 
recovery time of VOUT in response to a large load step. 
Transient response is usually the more stringent criteria 
in low output voltage applications. The output capacitor 
must provide the increased load current or absorb the 
excess inductor current (when the load current steps 
down) until the control loop can re-adjust the current of 
the inductor to the new load level. Typically, it requires 
two or more cycles for the loop to detect the output 
change and respond (change the duty cycle). It may 
also be expressed as the maximum output voltage drop 
or rise when the full load is connected or disconnected 
(100% load step). The minimum output capacitance 
can be given by Equation 15, which represents that the 
ΔVOUT (overshoot or undershoot) is approximately 
equal to the ΔIOUT (load current step) multiplied by the 
output impedance at crossover frequency. The target 
crossover frequency is 1/10th of the switching 
frequency.

where: 
• ΔIOUT is the change in output current. 
• fSW is the regulator's switching frequency. 
• ΔVOUT is the allowable change in the output voltage. 
For example, if the acceptable transient to a 4A load 
step is 4%, by inserting ΔVOUT = 72mV and ΔIOUT = 4A, 
the minimum required capacitance will be 126μF. 
Generally, the ESR of ceramic capacitors is small 
enough. The impact of output capacitor ESR on the 
transient is not taken into account in Equation 15. 
 
Equation 16 can be used for the output ripple criteria 
and finding the minimum output capacitance needed. In 
this example, the allowed ripple is 9mV that results in 
minimum capacitance of 45µF.

Note that the impact of output capacitor ESR on the

output capacitor to meet the output voltage ripple 
requirement. In this example, the ESR must be less 
than 4mΩ.

to aging, temperature, and DC bias derating of the 
output capacitors. In this example, a 4 × 47μF/6.3V 
1206 X5R ceramic capacitor with 3mΩ of ESR is used. 
The amount of ripple current that a capacitor can 
handle without damage or overheating is limited. The 
inductor ripple is bypassed through the output capacitor.

capacitor must support. In this example, it is 653mA.

Input Capacitor Design 
A high-quality ceramic capacitor (X5R or X7R or better 
dielectric grade) must be used for input decoupling of 
the SGM61184. At least 4.7μF of effective capacitance 
(after deratings) is needed on the VIN input. If input 
power is far away from the device, additional bulk 
capacitor is recommended in parallel to stabilize input 
voltage. The RMS value of input capacitor can be 
calculated from Equation 26 and the maximum ICIRMS 
occurs at 50% duty cycle. For this example, the 
maximum input RMS current is 3.9A with the 4.5V 
minimum input. The ripple current rating of input 
capacitor should be greater than ICIRMS.

In this example, the voltage rating of capacitor should 
have a safe margin from maximum input voltage. 
Therefore, select two 10µF, 1206X7R, 25V and two 
0.1μF, 0603X7R, 25V capacitors in parallel and put on 
both sides of the device near both VIN pins to PGND 
pins. The total input capacitance derates to 7.6μF at 
the normal input voltage of 12V. They are placed in 
parallel because the two VIN inputs are tied together to 
operate from a single supply in this design.  
The input voltage ripple can be calculated from 
Equation 20, the maximum ripple occurs at 50% duty 
cycle. In this example, the input voltage ripple is 192mV 
at the 12V normal input.

Soft-Start Capacitor 
The soft-start capacitor programs the ramp-up time of 
the output voltage during power-up. The ramp is 
needed in many applications due to limited voltage 
slew rate required by the load or limited available input 
current to avoid input voltage sag during start-up 
(UVLO) or to avoid over-current protection that can 
occur during output capacitor charging. Soft-start will 
solve all these issues by limiting the output voltage slew 
rate.  
Equation 21 (with ISS = 4.7μA and VREF = 0.6V) can be 
used to calculate the soft-start capacitor for a required 
soft-start time (tSS). In this example, the output 
capacitor value is relatively small (47μF×4) and the 
soft-start time is not critical because it does not require 
too much charge for 1.8V output voltage. However, it is 
better to set a small arbitrary value, like CSS = 8.2nF 
that results in 1ms start-up time.

Bootstrap Capacitor Selection 
A 0.1μF ceramic capacitor with 10V or higher voltage 
rating must be connected between the BOOT-SW pin. 
X5R or better dielectric types are recommended.  
 
UVLO Setting 
The under-voltage lockout (UVLO) can be programmed 
from VIN pins by an external voltage divider network. In 
this design, the turn-on (enable to start switching) 
occurs when VIN rises above 4.5V. When the regulator 
is working, it will not stop switching (disabled) until the 
input falls below 4V. Equations 1 and 2 are provided to 
calculate the resistors. For this example, the nearest 
standard resistor values are R1 = 76.8kΩ and R2 = 
27.4kΩ. 
 
Feedback Resistors 
A resistor divider created by an upper resistor (R4) and 
a lower resistor (R5) can set the output voltage. 
Equation 22 calculates the resistors. When R5 is 
selected as 6.04kΩ, the nearest 1% resistor for the 
calculated R4 value (12.08kΩ) is 12.1kΩ. For higher 
output accuracy, choose resistors with better tolerance 
(0.5% or better).

APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued) 
Minimum Output Voltage 
There is a minimum output voltage limit for any given 
input voltage due to the limited minimum switching 
on-time of the device. Above the 0.6V minimum 
possible output, the lowest achievable voltage is given 
by Equation 23. 
VOUTMIN = tONMIN × fSWMAX (VINMAX + IOUTMIN (RDSON_HMIN - 
RDSON_LMIN)) - IOUTMIN (RL + RDSON_HMIN)   (23) 
where: 
• VOUTMIN = Minimum achievable output voltage. 
• tONMIN = Minimum controllable on-time (150ns MAX). 
• fSWMAX = Maximum fSW (including tolerance). 
• VINMAX = Maximum input voltage. 
• IOUTMIN = Minimum load current. 
• RDSON_HMIN = Minimum high-side switch RDSON (8.6mΩ 
to 10mΩ, TYP). 
• RDSON_LMIN = Minimum low-side switch RDSON (4.5mΩ 
to 4.7mΩ, TYP). 
• RL = Output Inductor series resistance. 
 
Loop Compensation Design 
Several techniques are used by engineers to 
compensate a DC/DC regulator. The recommended 
calculation method here is quite simple and yields 
results with high phase margins. In this method, the 
effects of the slope compensation are ignored. 
Because of this approximation, the actual cross over 
frequency is usually lower than the calculated value. 
For this design, the target cross frequency fC = fSW/10 = 
70kHz. For COUT, the derated value of 126.8μF and 
RESR of 1mΩ are used. Having the crossover frequency, 
the compensation network (R6 and C12) can be 
calculated. R6 programs the gain of the compensated 
network at the crossover frequency and can be 
calculated by Equation 24.

The initial compensation based on these calculations is 
R6 = 10kΩ, C12 = 3.3nF, and C11 = 24pF. These values 
yield a stable design, but it is at a critical point that 
meets the dynamic response requirements. Type III 
compensation can be used to improve bandwidth and 
phase margin. It is used by adding the feed forward 
capacitor C13 in parallel with the upper feedback 
resistor. The feed forward capacitor generates a not 
independent zero pole pair. The position of the zero 
point is calculated by Equation 27.The position of the 
pole point is calculated by Equation 28. For this design, 
C13 = 180pF and R11 = 390Ω are selected to obtain a 
better bandwidth and phase margin. For the typeIII 
compensation, R11 is necessary, which can help to 
adjust the position of zero and pole pairs more flexibly 
and reduce the switching noise of FB node.

APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued) 
Layout Guidelines 
 PCB 
layout 
is 
critical 
for 
stable 
and 
high-performance converter operation. 
 Place the nearest input high frequency decoupling 
capacitor between VIN and AGND pins as close as 
possible. 
 Place a larger input ceramic capacitor close to VIN 
and GND pins for minimizing the influence of ground 
bounce. 
 Use short and wide trace to connect SW node to the 
inductor. Minimize the area of switching loop. 
Otherwise, large voltage spikes on the SW node and 
poor EMI performance are inevitable. 
 Sensitive signals like FB, COMP, EN, RT/CLK traces 
must be placed away from high dv/dt nodes (such as 
SW) and not inside any high di/dt loop (like capacitor 
or switch loops). The ground of these signals should 
be connected to GND pin and separated with power 
ground. 
 To 
improve 
the 
thermal 
performance, 
it 
is 
recommended to use 4-layers PCB with large ground 
planes. Using a group of small thermal vias near the 
power traces as well as near the input and output 
capacitors can provide a good heat conduction path 
from the device to the PCB board. 
 Connect VIN, GND pins to large copper areas to 
increase heat dissipation and long-term reliability. 
Keep SW area small to avoid emission issue.
