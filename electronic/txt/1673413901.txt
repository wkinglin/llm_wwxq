GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The 
SGM61430 
and 
SGM61431 
are 
internally 
compensated, synchronous Buck converters with a 
wide 4.5V to 36V input voltage range and 3A output 
current capability. These devices can be easily used in 
various industrial applications powered from unregulated 
sources. Easy compensation and cycle-by-cycle current 
limit are obtained by peak current mode control. With 
64μA (TYP
, SGM61430) quiescent current and ultra-low 
0.6μA (TYP) shutdown current, they are well suited for 
battery powered systems to prolong battery life. Internal 
compensation allows quick and low component count 
design. 
Both SGM61430 and SGM61431 can operate at fixed 
frequency with moderate or heavy load condition. In light 
load condition, the SGM61430 enters in the pulse 
frequency modulation (PFM) mode to improve high 
efficiency, while the SGM61431 works in the forced 
pulse width modulation (FPWM) mode to achieve low 
output ripple and good regulation. 
The EN/SYNC employs an enable divider to establish a 
precision threshold that simplifies UVLO adjustment, 
device on/off control and power sequencing. Thermal 
shutdown and output short-circuit protection (hiccup 
mode) are also provided. 
The SGM61430 and SGM61431 are both available in a 
Green SOIC-8 (Exposed Pad) package and can operate 
over -40℃ to +125℃ ambient temperature range.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
Overview 
The SGM61430 and SGM61431 are 3A output 
synchronous Buck converters with internal compensation 
and peak current mode control. They can operate from 
an input voltage range of 4.5V to 36V. These devices 
need a few external components and provide an easy 
and small size power supply solution for industrial 
applications with good thermal performance. With 64μA 
(TYP, SGM61430) quiescent current and 0.6μA (TYP) 
shutdown current, they are also well suited for battery 
powered applications. 
Both devices normally operate at fixed 390kHz frequency. 
At light load condition, the SGM61430 enters PFM mode 
to keep high efficiency, and the SGM61431 maintains 
FPWM mode to keep low output ripple and tight voltage 
regulation at light loads. The normal frequency can be 
synchronized to an external clock between 200kHz and 
2.2MHz. 
Accurate EN input threshold and internal soft-start time 
(1.5ms TYP) add more design flexibility to these devices. 
Additional features such as thermal shutdown, input 
under-voltage lockout, cycle-by-cycle current limit, and 
short-circuit protection (hiccup mode) are also provided. 
Switching Frequency and Current Mode 
Control 
The Functional Block Diagram and basic waveforms of 
these Buck synchronous converters are shown in 
Figure 2 and Figure 3. The N-MOSFETs are used for 
high-side (HS) and low-side (LS) (synchronous rectifier) 
switches. The HS duty cycle (D = tON/tSW) is controlled 
in closed loop to regulate and maintain the output 
voltage at a constant level. The switching period is tSW 
= 1/fSW, and the HS on-time is tON. When HS is turned 
on, the SW node voltage sharply rises towards VIN, and 
the inductor current (IL) starts ramping up with (VIN - 
VOUT)/L slope. When HS is turned off, the LS is turned 
on after a very short dead time to avoid shoot-through, 
and IL ramps down with -VOUT/L slope. When the 
inductor current is continuous (either due to sufficient 
load or FPWM), the output voltage is proportional to the 
input voltage and duty cycle (VOUT = D × VIN) if 
component parasitics are ignored. 
The output voltage is sensed by a resistor divider 
through FB pin and is regulated by feedback loop. This 
voltage is compared to an accurate reference and the 
voltage error signal is used as set point for an inner 
current loop that adjusts the peak inductor current. The 
input to the current loop is clamped to a fixed level to 
limit the maximum peak current and is compared to the 
actual peak current, sensed by the voltage drop across 
the HS switch to control the HS switch on-time. The 
loop internal compensation allows easy and stable 
design of the power supply with a few external 
elements for almost any output capacitor arrangement.

Output Voltage Setting 
The output voltage can be stepped down to as low as 
the 0.804V reference voltage (VREF). An external 
feedback resistor divider along with the internal 
reference is used to set the output voltage (VOUT) as 
shown in Figure 4. The VREF is compared to the VFB 
voltage and the control loop adjusts the duty cycle to 
null the VREF - VFB.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Use 1% or higher quality resistors with low thermal 
tolerance for an accurate and thermally stable output 
voltage. The low-side resistor RFBB is selected based on 
the desired current in the divider. Typically, a 10kΩ to 
100kΩ resistor is selected for RFBB. 
Lower RFBB values increase loss and reduce light load 
efficiency, however, improve VOUT accuracy in PFM. 
Large RFBT values (>1MΩ) are not recommended 
because the feedback path impedance will be too high 
and more noise sensitive. If a large RFBT value is 
necessary, the PCB layout design will be more critical 
because the feedback path must be short and away 
from noise sources such as SW node or inductor body. 
EN/SYNC Input 
The EN/SYNC pin is an input and must not be left open. 
The simplest way to enable the device is to connect this 
pin to VIN pin via a resistor. This allows for self-startup 
of the SGM61430/1 when VIN > VIN_UVLO. This pin can 
also be used to turn the device on or off with logic or 
analog signals. If VEN < 1.07V (TYP), the device will 
shut down. Only if VEN > 1.50V (TYP) the device will start 
operation. 
The system UVLO level can be increased accurately 
with a resistor divider (see Figure 5). This feature can 
be used for power supply sequencing which is required 
for proper power up of the system voltage rails. It can 
also be used as protection, such as preventing supply 
battery from depletion. Control of the enable input by 
logic signals may also be used for sequencing or 
protection. 
The EN/SYNC pin can also be used to synchronize the 
internal oscillator to an AC coupled external clock (see 
Figure 6). The SW cycles synchronize to the rising 
edges of the clock. Synchronization range is from 
200kHz to 2.2MHz. The clock signal peak-to-peak 
voltage must exceed 2.8V to override the internal 
oscillator but must be kept below 5.5V. Also the on and 
off pulse widths of the clock must be at least 100ns 
(TYP). 3.3V clock amplitude and CSYNC = 1nF (coupling 
capacitor) should be sufficient for most designs. Keep 
the RENT||RENB near 100kΩ range for stable syncing. 
The RENT is necessary for external syncing but the RENB 
is only needed for UVLO adjustment.  
The SGM61430/1 switching action can be synchronized to 
an external clock from 200kHz to 2.2MHz. Figure 6 
shows the device synchronized to an external system 
clock.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
BOOT (Bootstrap Voltage) 
The gate driver of the HS N-MOSFET switch requires a 
voltage higher than VIN that is present on its drain. A 
bootstrap voltage regulator is integrated to provide this 
voltage which is powered by bootstrapping through a 
small ceramic capacitor placed between the BOOT and 
SW pins. CBOOT is charged in each cycle when the LS 
switch is turned on (VSW ≈ 0V) and discharges to the 
boot regulator when the HS switch is turned on (VSW ≈ 
VIN). A 0.47μF ceramic capacitor with 16V or higher 
rated voltage is recommended. 
VCC Decoupling 
The VCC pin is connected to the output of an LDO that 
is integrated in the device and provides a 5V supply 
(nominal) for the internal circuitry and MOSFET drivers. 
It is intended for bypassing LDO output to ground and 
should not be loaded. A 2.2µF to 10µF stable ceramic 
capacitor rated for 16VDC or higher must be placed as 
close as possible to VCC pin and grounded to the 
exposed pad and ground pins. The device may be 
damaged if VCC pin is shorted to ground during 
operation. 
Minimum On-Time and Off-Time 
The shortest duration for the HS switch on-time (tON_MIN) 
is 110ns (TYP). For the off-time (tOFF_MIN) the minimum 
value is 80ns (TYP). The duty cycle (or equivalently the 
VOUT/VIN ratio) range in CCM operation is limited by 
tON_MIN and tOFF_MIN depending on the switching 
frequency. The minimum and maximum allowed duty 
cycles are given by Equations 2 and 3: 
DMIN = tON_MIN × fSW 
 
 
 
 
(2) 
and 
DMAX = 1 - tOFF_MIN × fSW  
 
 
(3) 
Note that the duty cycle has a more limited range at 
higher frequencies. DMAX limits the lowest VIN voltage 
for a given VOUT. 
For any given output voltage, the switching frequency is 
an important factor to maximize efficiency and input 
voltage range and minimize solution size. The highest 
input voltage can be calculated from:

Compensation and Feed-Forward

The 
SGM61430 
and 
SGM61431 
are 
internally 
compensated (see Figure 2) and are stable over the 
entire fSW and VOUT operating range. However, the 
phase margin can be low for some ranges of VOUT when 
low ESR ceramic capacitors are used in the output. In 
such cases, it is recommended to use a feed-forward 
capacitor (CFF) in parallel with the RFBT to improve the 
transient response as shown in Figure 8.

Refer to Table 1 for a list of suitable COUT, CFF and RFBT 
combinations. If for similar COUT values, other RFBT 
values are used, adjust the CFF such that (CFF × RFBT) is 
unchanged. CFF must also be modified if COUT is 
changed. For COUT capacitors with lower ESR, larger 
CFF values are needed. For example, with electrolytic 
capacitors (large ESR), the location of ESR zero, 
(Equation 7), is typically low enough for phase boost at 
crossover and CFF is not needed.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued)
Note that CFF increases the feedback of the output 
ripple and the coupled noise to the FB node. A large 
CFF value can deteriorate the VOUT regulation. If 
significant derating for the CFF value at cold operating 
temperatures is expected, it is better to use larger COUT 
capacitance rather than increasing the nominal CFF 
value. 
Thermal Shutdown (TSD) 
If the junction temperature exceeds +175℃ (TYP), the 
device will shut down. It will recover automatically with 
a normal power up sequence and soft-start when the 
temperature falls below +155℃ (TYP). 
Functional Modes 
Shutdown Mode 
The EN input controls the device on/off condition. If VEN 
< 1.07V (TYP), the device will shut down. The device 
will also turn off if either VIN or VCC falls below its UVLO 
threshold. 
Active Mode 
If VEN is above its precision threshold, and VIN and VCC 
are above their UVLO levels, the device will be 
activated. EN pin can be connected to VIN to allow 
self-startup when VIN voltage is in the 4.5V to 36V 
operating range. VCC, UVLO and EN/SYNC settings in 
active mode are explained in the previous sections. 
These operating modes are possible depending on the 
load current: (∆IL = inductor peak-to-peak current ripple) 
1. CCM: Fixed frequency continuous conduction mode: 
both SGM61430 and SGM61431 can operate in CCM 
when IOUT > ∆IL/2. 
2. DCM: Fixed frequency discontinuous conduction mode: 
only for SGM61430 (PFM). 
3. PFM: Pulse frequency modulation (SGM61430 only): 
the switching frequency reduces at very light load 
operation, when HS switch reaches its minimum 
on-time or IPEAK_MIN falls below 300mA (TYP). 
4. FPWM: Forced pulse width modulation mode for 
SGM61431 only: it operates with fixed frequency at 
light load operation. 
Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM) 
In CCM, the frequency is fixed and the output voltage 
ripple will be minimal. The maximum output current of 
3A is supplied in CCM. 
Light Load Operation with PFM (SGM61430) 
If the output current of the SGM61430 falls below ∆IL/2, 
its operating mode changes to DCM (also called diode 
emulation mode or DEM). In DCM, the LS switch is 
turned off when its current reverses direction and drops 
to IL_ZC (IL_ZC = -40mA TYP). Switching and conduction 
losses in DCM are lower than FPWM operation at light 
load condition, even before entering PFM. 
At light load condition, the device enters PFM to keep 
its high efficiency. PFM is activated when the HS switch 
reaches its minimum on-time (tON_MIN) or minimum peak 
current (inductor IPEAK_MIN = 300mA TYP). In PFM, fSW is 
reduced to maintain regulation. With reduced frequency, 
the switching losses are also dropped and efficiency is 
improved. There is no synchronization to the external 
clock in PFM mode. 
Light Load Operation with FPWM (SGM61431) 
For FPWM option, SGM61431 is locked in PWM mode 
from full load to no load. Negative inductor currents are 
allowed at light load to continue PWM operation. It is a 
tradeoff that sacrifices light load efficiency for lower 
output ripple, better output regulation and keeping 
switching frequency fixed. To avoid fatal negative 
current in the LS switch, this current is limited at IL_NEG. 
Synchronization is available over the full load range in 
the FPWM mode.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Over-Current Protection (OCP) and 
Short-Circuit Protection (SCP) 
Cycle-by-cycle current limit for both peak and valley 
currents (upper and lower switches peak currents) are 
included in the SGM61430/1. If the OCP or SCP 
persists, it will enter hiccup mode to avoid thermal 
shutdown. 
The HS switch over-current protection is natural in peak 
current mode control. In each cycle the HS current 
sensing starts a short time (blanking time) after it is 
turned on. The slope compensation ramp is deducted 
from the EA (Error Amplifier) output to avoid sub 
harmonic oscillations and the result is compared to the 
HS current to determine the HS turn-off time (on-time). 
See Figure 2 for details. Before comparison, the EA 
output is clamped to a fixed maximum threshold 
(IHS_LIMIT) to limit the current. So, the peak current limit 
of the high-side switch is not affected by the slope 
compensation and remains constant over the full duty 
cycle range. 
When the LS switch turns on the inductor current starts 
falling. The LS current is sensed while it is on and the 
switch will not turn off at the end of cycle if this current 
is still higher than its limit (ILS_LIMIT) and keeps 
conducting until the current falls below ILS_LIMIT. During 
OCP or SCP, the LS current limit is not effective until 
the HS current limit is triggered. 
A short dead time is considered after the LS switch is 
turned off, in which both switches are kept off and then 
a new cycle starts by turning the HS switch on. 
If the LS switch over-current detection continues for 
128 successive cycles, hiccup current protection will be 
started in which the regulator remains off for 30ms 
(TYP) before restarting the converter. If OCP or SCP is 
still detected after this restart, a new hiccup cycle will 
be repeated. Hiccup mode is considered to protect the 
device from overheating and damage in severe 
over-current conditions. 
In the SGM61431 (FPWM option), the inductor current 
can go negative at light load or during transients. For 
this device, the LS switch current is limited by negative 
current (IL_NEG) and if the magnitude of the negative 
current exceeds this limit, the LS switch will turn off until 
the next cycle to protect the switch from large currents.

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
The design method and component selection for the 
SGM61430/1 Buck converters are explained in this 
section. Schematic of a basic design is shown in Figure 
9. Only a few external components are needed to 
provide a constant output voltage from a wide input 
voltage range. 
The external components are designed based on the 
application requirements and device stability. Some 
suitable output filters (L and COUT) along with CFF and 
RFBT values are provided in Table 1 to simplify 
component selection. Consider the following notes 
when using this table. 
1. Choose the inductance for VIN = 36V. 
2. COUT values in the table are actual derated values. 
Use higher nominal values for ceramic capacitors. 
3. Use RFBT = 0Ω to set VOUT = 0.804V. Use RFBB = 
14.3kΩ for any other VOUT setting. 
4. If any other RFBT value is designed, resize CFF to 
keep (CFF × RFBT) unchanged. 
5. If the selected output capacitance has high ESR, the 
CFF is not necessary for extra phase boost.

APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued) 
Input Capacitor 
High frequency decoupling on the input supply pins is 
necessary for the device. A bulk capacitor may also be 
needed in some applications. Typically, 10μF to 22μF 
high quality ceramic capacitor (X5R, X7R or better) with 
voltage rating twice the maximum input voltage is 
recommended for decoupling capacitor. If the source is 
away from the device (> 5cm) some bulk capacitance is 
also needed to damp the voltage spikes caused by the 
wiring or PCB trace parasitic inductances. In this 
example, 2×10μF/50V/X7R capacitors and a 0.1μF 
ceramic capacitor placed right beside the device VIN 
and GND pins for very high-frequency filtering are 
used. 
Output Capacitor 
The main factors for designing COUT are output voltage 
ripple, control loop stability and the magnitude of output 
voltage overshoot/undershoot after a load transients. 
The output voltage ripple has two main components. 
One is due to the ac current (ΔIL) going through the 
capacitor ESR:

These AC components are not in phase and the total 
peak-to-peak ripple is less than ∆VOUT_ESR + ∆VOUT_C. 
In many applications, tight regulation in response to 
large and fast load transients is required. This can be a 
more severe condition on designing COUT value. 
Typically the control loop recovers the output voltage 
after four or five cycles and COUT should be large 
enough to provide the difference between current 
received from inductor and the current delivered to the 
load during this period. The minimum capacitance 
needed to limit the undershoot to VUS when the load 
steps up from IOL to IOH is given in Equation 10. Similarly, 
when the load steps from IOH down to IOL, COUT should 
be large enough to absorb the extra energy coming 
from the inductor without a large voltage overshoot (VOS) 
as calculated in Equation 11:

In this example, maximum acceptable ripple is 50mV. 
Assuming ΔVOUT_ESR = ΔVOUT_C = 50mV and KIND = 0.4. 
Equation 8 results in ESR < 41.7mΩ and Equation 9 
leads to COUT > 7.5μF. If the overshoot/undershoot 
transient requirement is 5% then VUS = VOS = 5% × VOUT 
= 250mV. Equations 10 and 11, IOH = 2.5A, IOL = 0.2A, 
lead to COUT > 94μF and COUT > 24μF respectively. Now 
considering all conditions and including voltage 
derating of the ceramic capacitors, COUT is composed of 
a 47μF/16V ceramic capacitor parallel 
with 
a 
100μF/10V capacitor with 5mΩ ESR. 
Output Voltage Setting 
An external resistor divider is used to set the output 
voltage as shown in Figure 8. Use Equation 12 to set

where VREF = 0.804V is the internal reference. For 
example, by choosing RFBB = 14.3kΩ, the RFBT value for 
5V output will be calculated as 75kΩ. 
Switching Frequency 
The SGM61430/1 switching frequency is 390kHz (TYP). 
However, it can be modified by synchronizing to an 
external clock in the 200kHz to 2.2MHz range. It may 
also drop due to PFM operation. 
Inductor 
Three main inductor parameters that need to be 
designed are inductance, saturation current and rated 
current. The DCR is also an important factor for 
efficiency. Physical dimensions, form factor and 
shielded or non-shielded structure are other important 
factors that are selected based on the application. The 
inductance is designed by selecting the peak-to-peak 
current ripple (ΔIL) that is given by Equation 13. ΔIL is 
increase at higher input voltages, so VIN_MAX is used in 
the equation. The minimum required inductance (LMIN) 
is calculated from Equation 14. KIND represents the ratio 
of inductor ripple current to the maximum output current

During a short or over current, either RMS or peak 
inductor current can increase significantly. The inductor 
rated RMS and saturation current ratings should be 
higher than those peaks respectively. It is generally 
desired to choose an smaller inductance value to have 
faster transient response, smaller size, and lower DCR. 
However, reducing the inductance increases the 
current ripple that may result in over current detection 
and triggering OCP before reaching full load current. 
Moreover, higher current ripple increases core, 
conduction, and capacitor losses. Output voltage ripple 
will also be higher with the same output capacitance. In 
general, choosing a too small inductance is not 
recommended for peak current mode control. On the 
other hand, too large inductance is also not 
recommended, because the reduced current ripple 
degrades the comparator signal to noise ratio. 
Selecting KIND = 0.4 results in LMIN = 8.78µH. A 10μH 
ferrite inductor with 5A RMS rating and 7.6A saturation 
current is selected as the closest standard value. 
Designing Feed-Forward Capacitor 
Even 
though 
the 
SGM61430/1 
are 
internally 
compensated, with low ESR ceramic capacitors, the 
phase margin can be low depending on the VOUT and 
fSW values. By adding an external feed-forward 
capacitor (CFF) in parallel with the RFBT, the phase 
margin can be improved (phase boost around 
crossover frequency). Without CFF, and if ESR is very 
small, the crossover frequency (fX) can be estimated 
from Equation 15, in which COUT is the actual derated 
value:

(16) 
For slightly larger ESR values, choose a CFF value that 
is less than Equation 16 estimate. For larger ESR values, 
CFF is not needed. Table 1 gives a quick starting point. 
In this example, a 56pF/50V/COG is selected for CFF. 
Bootstrap Capacitor 
The bootstrap capacitor powers the floating power 
MOSFET 
driver. 
It 
is 
recommended 
to 
use 
0.47μF/16V/X5R ceramic capacitor.  
The value of BST resistor generally is recommended to 
be in the range from 0 to 10Ω. BST resistor determines 
the turning on speed of the high side MOSFET. For the 
design where the critical path layout could not be 
optimized and follow the recommended layout, the 10Ω 
BST resistor is recommended to be used to in series 
with the Bootstrap capacitor. 
VCC Decoupling Capacitor (LDO Output) 
Use a 2.2μF/16V/X7R capacitor for decoupling VCC to 
assure stability of the device. It must be placed with 
minimum distance between VCC and GND pins. 
VIN UVLO Adjustment 
The system UVLO threshold can be increase using two 
external resistors RENT and RENB (see Figure 5) to form 
a voltage divider between VIN and EN pins. The UVLO 
comparator provides a rising threshold (power-up) and 
a falling threshold (power-down) for VIN. Use Equation 
17 to set the UVLO rising threshold.

in RENT = 853kΩ and a UVLO falling threshold of 4.29V.

Layout 
Consider the following layout design guidelines for a 
high-quality power supply with good thermal and EMI 
performances. 
1. Place CINx as close as possible to the VIN and PGND 
pins. CINx and COUTx returns should be close together 
and connected on the top layer PGND pin/plane and 
PAD. 
2. Place CVCC bypass capacitor right beside the VCC 
and ground pins on the top layer. 
3. Minimize FB trace length and keep both feedback 
resistors close to the FB pin. Bring the VOUT sense trace 
from the point where VOUT accuracy is important and 
keep it away from the noisy nodes (SW), preferably 
through another layer that is on the other side of a 
shield layer. Place CFF right beside RFBT. 
4. Use one of the mid-layers as ground plane for noise 
shielding and extra path for heat dissipation. 
5. Connect the ground layer to only one ground point 
on the top layer. The feedback and enable circuit 
returns must be routed separately through the ground 
plane to avoid large load currents or high di/dt switching 
currents to flow in these sensitive analog ground traces. 
Bad grounding results in poor regulation and erratic 
output ripple. 
6. Choose wide traces for VIN, VOUT and ground to 
minimize voltage drops and maximize efficiency. 
7. Use an array of thermal vias (e.g., 8 filled vias) under 
the exposed pad and connect them to the ground 
planes on mid-layers and the bottom layer. Maximize 
the heat sinking copper areas and solidify them with 
metal coatings such that the die temperature remains 
below +125℃ in all operating conditions.
