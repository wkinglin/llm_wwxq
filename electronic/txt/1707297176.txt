OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.

TH 
I 
Track or Hold Input. Input high for tracking (when THXOR is logic low, check THXOR 
description for more detail), where the VMON follows the current output of the APD pin 
simultaneously. Input low for holding where the VMON outputs a snapshot of APD current 
captured right after the following edge of the signal applied on the TH pin, in which the APD

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
The SGM41282C is a non-synchronous Boost converter 
using the constant frequency peak current mode 
control scheme for high-output voltage application such 
as APD high voltage biasing. 
The SGM41282C operates in discontinuous mode 
(DCM) to maintain the system stability for high 
conversion ratio for low input voltage to high output 
voltage. For DCM, it can eliminate the effect of 
right-hand zero of Boost converter. Inductor current 
rises from zero each cycle, there is no accumulation of 
inductor current when duty cycle is higher than 50%, so 
it can simplify the need for compensation circuit. 
The SGM41282C integrates APD biasing current mirror 
and trans-impedance amplifier (TIA) function. The TIA 
converts the mirror current to voltage signal and sends 
to VMON pin. 1× or 8× current mirror gain can be set 
by GAIN pin. Track and hold function can be set by 
XOR logic of THXOR and TH pin. 
 
Enable and Disable 
When the EN pin is pulled to high voltage, the 
SGM41282C is enabled. When the EN pin is pulled to 
low voltage, the SGM41282C goes into shutdown 
mode. Less than 1μA input current is consumed in 
shutdown mode.

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
Extending the Monitoring Range 
The GAIN pin input is for selecting 1×/8× gains for 
proper output levels, extending the appreciated 
monitoring range by 8 times. The gain could be 
changed during tracking or holding, with less 
interference injection. As the fiber receiver monitors 
signal in very high dynamic range but less resolution, 
this circuit brings out a unique tradeoff between the 
resolution and dynamic range. 
 
Programming the Current Limit Level 
Connect a resistor from RLIM pin to AGND to program 
the current-limit threshold. The RLIM for setting the 
current limit level is calculated with the following 
equation, and please refer to the Figure 3 for the typical 
ILIM to RLIM plot.

Ripple Filtering 
A simple RC filtering circuit could help in suppression of 
ripple applied at MB input, which then improving the 
modulation effect to the signal picked-up in the optical 
channel, which helps in getting better eye diagram 
opening. Refer to the Figure 4, the resistance of the R 
inserts drop to be compensated.

Backward Scattering 
Careful layout of the circuit optimization is desired for 
assuring fast transient measurement to APD current. 
Illustrative circuit is showed in the Figure 6, which 
shows necessary layout considerations. The CB is low 
loss capacitor installed in the TO-can in a BOSA, which 
holds the potential applied on the APD, and the CB 
should be evaluated on the final PCB, or，it will slow 
down the settling time of the monitoring output at the 
VMON besides the intrinsic propagation and settling of 
the SGM41282C.

The d and the c placed close to the ADC input are for 
ringing dump, which occurs when the ADC input switch 
cuts for holding. These two components do not affect 
the 
transient, 
but 
induce 
interference 
to 
the

External Components Selection 
As the Boost circuit works at about 850kHz, capacitors 
with good high frequency performance are needed for 
the application circuit. As the storage capacitor (the 
COUT in the Figure 1 or the Figure 2) works under high 
bias voltage, please refer to the capacitor’s datasheet 
to assure its effective capacitance is more than 0.1μF 
at the output voltage.
