GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM832A is a 16 bits ultra-precision I2C and 
SMBus compatible interface current, voltage, power 
monitor with alert function. It operates in a wide 
common-mode voltage range from 0V to 36V and a 
single 2.7V to 5.5V power supply. 
The device has three operating modes: continuous, 
triggered and power-down modes that can reduce 
quiescent current. Programmable averaging and 
conversion times allow for more flexibly to fit the timing 
requirements in a variety of applications. It also 
integrates alert functions with configured priority. 
The SGM832A is available in Green MSOP-10 and 
TDFN-3×3-10L packages. It is specified over the 
operating temperature range of -40℃ to +125℃.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
Overview 
The SGM832A is a 16 bits ultra-precision I2C and 
SMBus compatible interface current, voltage, power 
monitor. The device senses both shunt and bus 
voltages, and provides digital voltages, current and 
power readings in the data registers. In addition, it 
provides programmable registers to flexibly configure 
the device such as operating modes, conversion time, 
averaging times and alert functions. 
 
Basic ADC Functions 
The SGM832A measures two voltages at the input 
terminals, namely the voltage between the IN+ and IN- 
pins, and the voltage between VBUS and GND pins. In 
typical applications, a current sense resistor (shunt 
resistor) is connected to the IN+ and IN- pins. When 
load current flows through the resistor, the shunt 
voltage developed is measured. The bus voltage with 
respect to the ground is measured by connecting to the 
VBUS pin. 
The power supply voltage of the device ranges from 
2.7V to 5.5V. The voltage monitored on the VBUS pin 
(typically the bus voltage) ranges from 0V to 36V. The 
fixed LSB of the bus voltage measurement is 1.25mV, 
and therefore the full-scale range of SGM832A is 
40.96V. Please note that the voltage applied on the 
VBUS pin should not exceed 36V. 
Since the power supply of the device is independent of 
the input voltage, the power-up sequence does not 
need special attention. Therefore, the bus and shunt 
voltages can be applied on the input pins when the 
device is power-off. 
The SGM832A measures two voltages, shunt voltage 
and bus voltage. The measured shunt voltage is 
converted 
to 
current 
according 
to 
the 
value 
programmed into the Calibration Register (05h). Then, 
the power is calculated based on the calculated current 
and the measured bus voltage. 
Continuous mode and triggered mode are two 
operating modes of the device. For the continuous 
mode (default, set MODE[2:0] bits of the Configuration 
Register (00h) to ‘111’), the device continuously 
measures and converts the shunt voltage followed by 
the bus voltage. The current can be calculated after 
shunt voltage conversion. Then, the calculated current 
value along with the converted bus voltage value are 
used to calculate the power. See Programming the 
Calibration Register section for more detailes. The 
values of shunt voltage, bus voltage, current and power 
are subsequently stored in an internal accumulator, and 
then repeat the above steps until the repeat times 
reach the average value set in the Configuration 
Register. Following each sequence, the measured and 
calculated values are added to the previously 
accumulated values. When the number of sequence 
reaches the averages, the average calculations are 
performed on all the accumulated values, and the final 
average value of shunt voltage, bus voltage, current 
and power are updated in the corresponding data 
registers which can be read. These values in the data 
registers remain readable until the next fully conversion 
cycle is completed. The ongoing conversion is not 
affected by the data registers reading. 
Besides converting both the shunt voltage and bus 
voltage, the device can also be configured to convert 
only the shunt voltage or the bus voltage by setting the 
mode control bits in the Configuration Register. This 
design provides more application flexibility to the users. 
Please note that all the current and power calculations 
are performed in the background and they do not take 
up the conversion time. 
For the triggered mode, the device is triggered to 
perform a single-shot measurement/conversion by 
writing any of the triggered control modes to the 
Configuration Register (set the MODE[2:0] bits to ‘001’, 
‘010’ or ‘011’). This action controls the device to 
perform a single measurement/conversion. Therefore, 
to trigger another single conversion, the Configuration 
Register must be written again, even though the 
operation mode does not change. 
Besides the continuous and triggered modes, the 
power-down mode of the device can decrease the 
quiescent current and block current into the inputs. In 
this mode, the registers of the device can still be written 
and read. Until one of the active modes is written into 
the Configuration Register, the device stays in 
power-down mode.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (Continued) 
The device provides a conversion ready flag bit 
(Mask/Enable Register, CVRF bit) to help coordinate 
one-shot or trigger conversions. The CVRF bit is set 
after all the conversions, multiplication and averaging 
are completed. 
The CVRF bit clears under the conditions of writing to 
the Configuration Register (the MODE[2:0] bits is not in 
power-down mode), and reading the Mask/Enable 
Register (06h). 
 
Power Calculation 
Following each shunt voltage and bus voltage 
measurement, the current and power are calculated, as 
shown in Figure 4. Following a shunt voltage 
measurement, the current is calculated according to the 
value set in the Calibration Register. If no value is 
written to the Calibration Register, the current value in 
the output register (Current Register, 04h) is ‘0’. 
Following a bus voltage measurement, the power is 
calculated based on the measured bus voltage and the 
calculated current value. Also, if no value is written to 
the Calibration Resister, the power value in the register 
(Power Register, 03h) is ‘0’. The current and power 
values are regarded as intermediate results (unless the 
average time is set to ‘1’), and are stored in an 
accumulator rather than the output data registers. 
Following each conversion sequence, the calculated 
current and power values are added to the previously 
accumulated values until the number of sequence 
reaches the average times. After that, the accumulated 
values are averaged, and the final current and power 
values are updated in the corresponding registers. 
Similar to the current and power values, the shunt and 
bus voltage values are also collected and accumulated 
following each measurement sequence. After the 
number of sequence reaches the averages, the 
accumulated values are averaged and the final shunt 
and 
bus 
voltage 
values 
are 
updated 
in 
the 
corresponding registers. 
 
Alert Pin 
The SGM832A provides an Alert pin to respond to one 
of the five available alert functions or to a conversion 
ready event. They are shunt voltage over-limit (SOL), 
shunt voltage under-limit (SUL), bus voltage over-limit 
(BOL), bus voltage under-limit (BUL) and power 
over-limit (POL). The alert functions and the conversion 
ready event can be enabled through the Mask/Enable 
Register. The device provides an Alert Limit Register 
(07h) to set limit value for comparison. By writing a 
value into the Alert Limit Register and enable the alert 
function through the Mask/Enable Register, the Alert 
pin is asserted when the alert event occurs.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (Continued) 
The Alert pin is an open-drain structure. It will be 
asserted if the alert function selected in the 
Mask/Enable Register is above the alert limit value set 
in the Alert Limit Register. 
Correspondingly, the alert function flag (AFF bit, 4-bit) 
in the Mask/Enable Register is set when the selected 
alert event occurs. Among the five available alert 
functions, only one can be enabled. If multiple alert 
function bits in the Mask/Enable Register are selected, 
only the alert function with the highest significant bit will 
be successfully enabled and monitored. For example, if 
both the shunt voltage over-limit (SOL bit, 15-bit) and 
the shunt voltage under-limit (SUL bit, 14-bit) functions 
are selected, only the shunt voltage over-limit function 
will be successfully enabled, and the Alert pin is 
asserted when the value in the Shunt Voltage Register 
exceeds the value in the Alert Limit Register. 
The Alert pin can also be configured to monitor the 
conversion ready state through setting the CNVR bit 
(10-bit) of the Mask/Enable Register. The Alert pin is 
asserted when the device has finished the previous 
conversions and the conversion ready flag (CVRF bit, 
3-bit) is set. The conversion ready is monitored at the 
Alert pin with one of the five alert functions. If both the 
conversion ready and an alert function are enabled to 
be monitored at the Alert pin, when the Alert pin is 
enabled, the Mask/Enable Register must be read to 
determine which source asserts the Alert pin. Since the 
CVRF bit is set when the conversion ready event 
occurs, and the alert function flag (AFF bit, 4-bit) is set 
when the selected alert event occurs, by reading the 
CVRF and AFF bits in the Mask/Enable Register, the 
event that asserts the Alert pin can be determined. If 
the conversion ready is not desired to be monitored at 
the Alert pin, by clearing the CNVR bit, the Alert pin 
would only respond to the selected alert function. 
Leave the Alert pin floating if not use it to monitor the 
conversion ready state or any alert function. 
Figure 4 shows the relative timing of the conversion 
and alert detection. Take the SOL function as an 
example, following each shunt voltage conversion, the 
shunt voltage value is compared with the limit value 
programmed into the Alert Limit Register to determine 
whether the selected alert event occurs. The AFF bit of 
the Mask/Enable Register is asserted (set to high) 
when the converted value exceeds the limit value. 
When the AFF bit is asserted, the Alert pin is asserted 
and its polarity is decided by the alert polarity bit (APOL 
bit, 1-bit) of the Mask/Enable Register. If the Alert pin is 
latched by asserting the alert latch enable bit (LEN bit, 
0-bit), the AFF bit along with the Alert pin remain 
asserted until writing to the Configuration Register or 
reading the Mask/Enable Register. 
The BOL converted bus voltage value with the limit 
value following each bus voltage conversion and 
asserts the AFF bit and Alert pin once the converted 
value exceeds the limit value. 
The POL alert function compares the calculated power 
value with the limit value following each bus voltage 
conversion and asserts the AFF bit and Alert pin once 
the converted value exceeds the limit value. 
 
Device Functional Modes 
Averaging and Conversion Times Considerations 
The averaging and conversion times are programmed 
by 
the Configuration 
Register. 
Eight levels 
of 
conversion time from 150μs to 7.736ms are available. 
The programmable conversion and average times 
allow the device to match different time requirements in 
real applications. For example, if a system requires 
reading the shunt voltage and bus voltage every 10ms, 
the conversion time for shunt and bus voltage 
measurement can be set to 1.036ms, with the average 
time set to 4. With this configuration, the shunt and 
voltage values are updated approximately every 
8.288ms. Also, the conversion time for shunt and 
voltage measurement can be different, which allows the 
device to focus on one of the two voltages. Suppose 
the system desires more conversion time for shunt 
voltage, a 7.736ms conversion time can be set for 
shunt voltage, with 1.036ms of conversion time for bus 
voltage and single conversion (average time set to ‘1’). 
With this configuration, the shunt and bus voltage 
values are updated approximately every 8.772ms. 
There are trade-offs between the conversion and 
average times used. The averaging can filter the input 
signal, thus effectively improving the measurement 
accuracy. With more average times, the device would 
reduce the noise of the input signal more effectively.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (Continued) 
Similarly, the conversion time also affects the 
measurement accuracy. A longer conversion time 
results in better measurement accuracy. Therefore, to 
achieve the highest measurement accuracy, use the 
longest conversion time with the most average times, 
provided that the time requirements of the system are 
met.

Figure 5. Noise vs. Conversion Time 
 
Filtering and Input Considerations 
In real applications, the current measurement usually 
introduces undesirable noise. The SGM832A provides 
different noise filtering capabilities by configuring the 
conversion and average times independently in the 
Configuration Register. The conversion time for shunt 
and bus voltage can be set independently, while the 
average times are the same. 
The ADC of SGM832A is a delta-sigma (Δ-Σ) structure 
with a 530kHz typical sampling rate. The delta-sigma 
structure has good noise suppression capability. 
However, if there are transients at or near the sampling 
frequency (greater than 1.06MHz), it will affect the 
measurement accuracy which needs to be handled. By 
placing low-value resistors in series with a ceramic 
capacitor at the IN+ and IN- pins, this high frequency 
signals can be effectively filtered. Figure 6 shows the 
filter setup, where the recommended resistor value is 
less than 10Ω and the recommended capacitor value is 
between 0.1μF and 1μF. Both resistor values should be 
consistent to avoid offset due to IBIAS. 
Besides the transients, the input overload conditions 
should also be well addressed. The inputs of the device 
can tolerate 40V voltage. During a load short-circuit, 
the load current flows the shunt resistor increases 
sharply. When the short-circuit fault is removed, the 
parasitic inductance in the power loop could induce 
kickback voltages on the inputs which may exceed the 
voltage ratings. Such kickback voltages can be well 
suppressed using zener-type devices.  
In some applications, an over-stress condition may 
occur as a result of an excessive dV/dt caused by event 
such as input hard short. The over-stress occurs due to 
the activation of the internal ESD protection with large 
available currents. The test results show that adding 
the 10Ω resistors at the inputs can sufficiently protect 
the devices from dV/dt induced fault event.

PROGRAMMING 
The SGM832A does not need to measure current and 
power directly, it realizes the calculation of current and 
power by measuring the differential voltage between 
IN+ and IN- pins and the voltage on VBUS pin. To 
obtain the correct current and power values, users 
need to program the resolution of the Current Register 
(Current_LSB) and the value of the sampling resistor 
applied between the IN+ and IN- pins. The resolution of 
the Power Register is set to be 25 times the 
programmed Current_LSB internally. The Calibration 
Register is used to calculate the corresponding current 
and power through the values of measured shunt and 
bus voltages. The determination of the Calibration 
Register value requires the value of Current_LSB and 
the sampling resistor. 
As shown in Equation 1, the value of Calibration 
Register is determined by Current_LSB and the 
sampling resistor (RSHUNT). Users can convert the value 
in Current Register to the actual current value in 
amperes through Current_LSB. According to Equation 
2, the minimum Current_LSB can be obtained to realize 
the highest resolution of the Current Register, which 
needs to determine an estimated maximum current first. 
In order to simplify the calculation process of converting 
the Current Register and Power Register into the 
corresponding amperes and watts, the smallest 
Current_LSB is generally rounded up to an integer.

After setting the value of Calibration Register, the 
Current Register and Power Register will be calculated 
and updated according to the measured shunt and bus 
voltages. 
Before 
the 
Calibration 
Register 
is 
programmed, both registers stay at 0. 
Programming the Calibration Register 
As shown in Figure 11, a nominal 10A load will result in 
a 20mV differential voltage across the 2mΩ shunt 
resistor. The VBUS pin of the SGM832A is used to 
measure the bus voltage, while in this example, it 
measures the voltage on the load by connecting to the 
IN- pin. And due to the 20mV drop across RSHUNT, the 
voltage on the IN- and the VBUS pin is 11.98V. 
For this example, assuming that the maximum 
expected current is 15A, the value of the Current_LSB 
can be calculated according to Equation 2 to be 
457.8µA/bit. In order to simplify the calculation process 
of converting the Current Register and the Power 
Register into the corresponding amperes and watts, 
choose the value of Current_LSB as 500μA/bit or 
1mA/bit. A value of 1mA/bit is chosen as Current_LSB, 
which is a trade-off between resolution and ease of 
conversion process for the user. After the above 
parameters are selected, the value of Calibration 
Register can be calculated according to Equation 1 to 
be 2560, or A00h. 
The value in the Current Register is then obtained by 
multiplying the decimal value in the Calibration Register 
by the decimal value in the Shunt Voltage Register 
(01h), and then dividing by 2048, as shown in Equation 
3. In this example, 8000 is obtained from the Shunt 
Voltage Register, which means the shunt voltage is 
20mV, and the decimal value in the Current Register is 
10000 or 2710h through Equation 3. Multiply this value 
by 1mA/bit to get a load current of 10A through RSHUNT.

The LSB of the Bus Voltage Register (02h) is fixed at 
1.25mV/bit, so 11.98V at the VBUS pin has a value of 
9584 or 2570h in the register. Since the VBUS cannot 
measure negative voltages, the MSB of the Bus 
Voltage Register is always 0.

Multiply the decimal value of the Current Register, 
10000 and the decimal value of the Bus Voltage 
Register, 9584 together, and then divide by 20000 to 
calculate the decimal value of the Power Register using 
Equation 4.

For this example, the Power Register calculates to 
4792, or 12B8h. Multiply this value by the power LSB to 
yield a power of 119.8W. As mentioned earlier, there is 
a ratio of 25 between the LSB of the power and the 
Current_LSB, which ensures that the calculated power 
is within an acceptable range. By manually calculating 
the power of the load, the bus voltage of 11.98V is 
multiplied by the load current of 10A, and the result is 
119.8W. 
The MSB of the Power Register is always 0, even if the 
current is negative, and the final calculated power is 
also positive. 
Table 1 shows the steps to configure registers, 
measure shunt and bus voltages, and calculate current 
and power for this device under the conditions of load = 
10A, VCM = 12V, RSHUNT = 2mΩ and VVBUS = 11.98V. 
 
Programming the Power Measurement 
Engine 
Calibration Register and Scaling 
The Calibration Register allows the user to set the 
range of the Current Register and Power Register 
within the most appropriate range for a specific 
application scenario. For example, set the value of the 
Calibration Register so that the value in the Current 
Register and Power Register is as close as possible to 
the full-scale point under the maximum current or 
power condition, so as to improve the current and 
power 
resolution. 
After 
Calibration 
Register 
is 
configured, the Current Register and Power Register 
will 
generate 
corresponding 
values. 
Users 
can 
calculate the actual current and power values 
equivalently by multiplying these values of registers by 
the corresponding LSB. In addition, in order to avoid 
other errors in the system, system-level calibration can 
be realized through an external ammeter and 
SGM832A. The specific principle is shown in Equation 
5. The value inside the Calibration Register is adjusted 
by the current value measured by the external ammeter 
and the measured value of SGM832A.

Simple Current Shunt Detection 
Application (No Programming Necessary) 
If the device only needs to read the shunt and bus 
voltage under the POR default configuration, where the 
conversion of shunt and bus voltages is continuous, the 
chip does not need other redundant programming. 
Without programming the Calibration Register of the 
device, the device will not provide current and power 
values (both remain at 0). 
 
Default Settings 
The default values of the registers after power-on are 
shown in the Register Maps section. These registers 
are volatile, so if the values in the registers are 
programmed to non-default values, the registers will 
need to be reprogrammed each time power is cycled. 
Specific information for programming the calibration 
register is given in the programming section, and the 
calculation process is based on Equation 1.

PROGRAMMING (continued) 
Bus Overview 
The SGM832A provides compatibility with I2C and 
SMBus interfaces. I2C and SMBus are essentially 
compatible. In this manual, the I2C interface is used as 
an example, and the SMBus interface will only be 
mentioned unless there is a difference between the 
SMBus interface and the I2C interface. SCL and SDA 
connect the device to the bus, and they are both 
open-drain connections. 
The device which can send the command to the target 
register is called master and the device which can be 
controlled by the master is called slave. The master 
device can generate the clock signal to the slave in 
order to control it with SCL and SDA lines. 
Send a specific address to start the slave, the SDA 
signal will be pulled from high to low while SCL is still in 
high state. For the slaves connected to the bus, at the 
CLK rising edge, the slaves start to be addressed by 
the master, and followed by a READ or WRITE bit. For 
the ninth bit of the transmission signal, if SDA is pulled 
low, the slave acknowledges the transmission, in which 
case the slave is being addressed. 
In one word, for the data transfer process, the initial 
signal will indicate a start state, and then followed by 
eight clock pulsed and an acknowledge signal. 
However, the stability of SDA signal should be 
guaranteed when SCL is high, otherwise it will be 
mistaken for START or STOP mode. After the 
transmission completes, the signal of SDA will change 
from low to high when SCL is high. The device provides 
a 28ms timeout action logic on its interface to avoid the 
bus being locked up. 
 
Serial Bus Address 
For the definition of I2C communication, before sending 
data, the master device should address the specified 
slave device. There are seven bits for the address of 
the slave device and another one bit is for the 
command of reading or writing. 
A0 and A1 are used to determine the address of the 
device. As shown in Table 2, if these two pins are at 
different logic levels, the device will have different 
addresses. The device will sample the state of A0 and 
A1 pins before each communication, so it is necessary 
to ensure the stability of the states of A0 and A1 pins 
before any actions taken on the interface. 
 
Serial Interface 
On the I2C bus or SMBus, the SGM832A can be 
operated as a slave device, which is controlled by the 
master. When connecting to the bus, both SDA and 
SCL pins are connected through the topology of 
open-drain. In addition, in order to improve the 
performance of slave devices under the condition of 
input spikes and noise bus, filter and Schmitt flip-flop 
are adopted. Although the device has integrated tip 
suppression in the digital I/O lines, it is recommended 
that proper layout be used to minimize coupling in the 
communication lines. Noise in communication lines 
mainly comes from two sources: capacitive coupling 
generated 
at 
the 
signal 
edges 
between 
two 
communication lines, or switching noise generated by 
other parts of the system. Keeping lines parallel to 
ground when routing can reduce coupling effects 
between communication lines. In addition, shielded 
signal lines reduce the possibility of unintended noise 
coupling 
into 
digital 
I/O 
lines 
that 
could 
be 
misinterpreted as a START or STOP command. 
There are two modes of transmission protocol: fast 
mode (1kHz to 400kHz) and high-speed mode (1kHz to 
2.94MHz). MSB is the first bit to be transferred when 
transmitting a byte.

PROGRAMMING (continued) 
Writing and Reading Operation 
In order to access the specified pointer register of 
SGM832A, it is necessary to send the values of the 
desired pointer register after addressing the slave 
device. As already illustrated in Figure 7, the values of 
pointer register are required after each write command. 
The first byte written to a register is the address of the 
slave device, and R/W
ഥ bit is low, then the device 
acknowledges receipt of a valid address. The second 
byte sent by the host is the address of the register to be 
written, which updates the register pointer to the 
desired register. The following two bytes are written to 
the register addressed by the register pointer, and the 
device then acknowledges receipt of each byte. Finally, 
the master generates a START or STOP condition to 
terminate data transfer (Figure 8). 
If the master device desires to read the information of 
the specified register, a write command must be send 
by the master at first to indicate which pointer register is 
needed. First, the slave address should be sent with 
the low state of R/W
ഥ, followed by the address of the 
pointer address (Figure 7). Second, the START 
command should be sent by the master, the slave 
address of the specified SGM832A, and then followed 
with the high state of R/W
ഥ to indicate a read command 
(Figure 9). The slave transmits the next byte, which is 
the most significant byte of the register indicated by the 
register pointer. For the condition of repeated reading, it 
is not required for sending the bytes of pointer register 
again, unless the device is reset or the address of 
pointer register is altered by the write command. 
 
High-Speed (HS) I2C Mode 
The SGM832A also supports high-speed (HS) I2C 
mode whose data rate speeds up to 2.94MHz. To 
enable this mode, the master device sends a START 
condition. After the START, a master code is 
transmitted ‘00001XXX’, followed by a mandatory Not 
Acknowledge (NACK) condition. Note that the master 
code is sent in Fast-mode or Standard-mode, which is 
at most 400kHz. 
The three lowest bits of the master code are used to 
identify different I2C masters on the same bus. The user 
should guarantee that each master device has its 
unique identifier. 
After the NACK condition, the high-speed transfer 
begins. At the master device side, the master device 
sends a REPEATED START condition followed by the 
slave address and the remaining data, the same as the 
frame in Fast-mode or Standard mode, just higher 
speed. At the slave device side, the SGM832A switches 
the internal circuit to support HS mode. To keep the bus 
in HS mode, the user should avoid using the STOP 
condition and use the REPEATED START condition 
instead. A STOP condition make the SGM832A switch 
back to support Fast-mode or Standard-mode. 
 
SMBus Alert Response 
The SGM832A has the ability to respond to the SMBus 
alert response that has the ability to identify a quick 
fault for simple slaves. The master broadcasts the alert 
response slave address (0001100) and the R/W
ഥ bit is 
high. The slave that generates the ALERT signal will 
send its own address through the bus after recognizing 
the alert response. The host can identify the slave that 
generates the alert after receiving the slave address 
(Figure 10). 
The alert response is similar to the I2C broadcast call, 
which may cause multiple slave devices to respond at 
the same time, and the bus arbitration rules is applied 
at this time. The losing device will not generate an 
Acknowledge but continue to pull the Alert line low until 
it is the device's turn to complete the Acknowledge. 
Cleared Alert pin asserts again until alert event 
removes.

Configuration Register (Address = 00h) 
The Configuration Register is used to configure the operating mode of the device. This register can not only control 
the conversion time and averaging mode of both shunt and bus voltages, but also control what signals are selected 
to be measured. 
The Configuration Register can be read without affecting device configuration and ongoing conversion. Writing to 
the Configuration Register suspends ongoing conversion until the write process is completed, and then the device 
will begin a new conversion process with the new configuration. The purpose is to avoid any uncertainty about the 
conditions under which a new conversion process will be started.

Shunt Voltage Register (Address = 01h) 
The Shunt Voltage Register is used to store the shunt voltage reading, VSHUNT. Positive numbers are directly 
displayed in binary format, while negative numbers are displayed in two's complement format. The two's 
complement of the negative number can be obtained by taking the binary complement of the absolute value of the 
negative number and adding one. An MSB = ‘1’ indicates it is a negative number. 
For example: assuming VSHUNT = -80mV: 
Convert the absolute value (80mV) to a decimal integer in LSBs (80mV/2.5µV) = 32000 
Convert this number to binary = 0111110100000000 
Complement this binary = 1000001011111111 
Add ‘1’ to the complement to get the two's complement = 1000001100000000 = 8300h. 
The register will display the averaged value if averaging enabled. 
Full-scale range of shunt voltage = 81.9175mV (decimal = 7FFF). LSB: 2.5μV.

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
The SGM832A is a current and power monitor with an 
I2C and SMBus compatible interface. Since the device 
can monitor the shunt and bus voltages, the current in 
amperes and power in watts readings can be directly 
obtained through the internal multiplier by setting the 
correct calibration value, conversion time and average 
mode.

Design Requirements 
The SGM832A characterizes current by the voltage 
drop across the shunt resistor. The device can also 
measure the bus voltage, and then calculate the 
corresponding power by programming the Calibration 
Register. It has a programmable alert function, which 
can respond to user-defined fault or conversion 
completion events. In addition, users can also 
customize the specific threshold that triggers alert. 
 
Detailed Design Procedure 
The Configuration Register is set according to the 
required conversion time and averaging mode. There 
are five alert response logics in the Mask/Enable 
Register, and the user selects the required alert 
function. The Alert pin should be pulled up to VVS via 
the pull-up resistor. With the comparison threshold set 
in the Alert Limit Register, the device determines 
whether the alert pin responds to the selected alert 
function. 
Figure 12 shows that the alert pin responds to the shunt 
voltage over-limit when the threshold is set to 80mV, 
the conversion time (tCT) is 1.036ms and averaging is 
set to 1. Figure 13 shows the response of reducing the 
conversion time from 1.036ms to 150µs under the 
same conditions.

Power Supply Recommendations 
The device can accurately measure the common-mode 
voltages applied to power supply terminals, which may 
be beyond its supply voltage VVS. For example, the 
device power supply voltage VVS is 5V, but the 
monitored load voltage can be as high as 36V. 
Regardless of whether the device is powered or not, 
the input terminal of the device can withstand a voltage 
of 0V to 36V. 
The bypass capacitors should be placed as close to 
input and GND pins of the device as possible to ensure 
the stability of the power supply. A bypass capacitor of 
0.1µF is recommended. For noisy or high-impedance 
power 
supplies, 
the 
device 
requires 
additional 
decoupling capacitors to filter power supply noise. 
 
Layout Guidelines 
A Kelvin connection or a 4-wire connection is 
recommended to be made between the input pins (IN+ 
and IN-) and the sensing resistor. These connection 
techniques avoid introducing additional impedance 
between the input pins. Considering that the resistance 
of the sensing resistor is very small, the additional high 
current-carrying impedance will result in considerable 
measurement errors.
