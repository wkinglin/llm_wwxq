 
SGM3124 
PWM Dimming, Charge Pump White LED 
Driver with Low Dropout Current Source 
 
 
JANUARY2013–REV. A.1
SG Micro Corp 
www.sg-micro.com 
GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM3124 is a current-regulated white LED driver 
with integrated low dropout current sources and a high 
efficiency charge pump. The charge pump has 1×/1.5× 
fractional operation mode. The SGM3124 is designed 
for LCD display backlight applications. 
The supply voltage operates from 2.7V to 5.5V and is 
well suited for various applications powered by a 1-cell 
Li-Ion battery, as well as 3-cell or 4-cell NiCd, NiMH or 
Alkaline batteries. 
The ISET reference current is set through an external 
resistor on the ISET pin. The SGM3124 supports up to 
3 LED strings for total maximum 120mA current. In 
addition, the charge pump with current control reduces 
input current ripple and ensures low EMI. Low 
capacitance makes the SGM3124 ideal for small 
battery-powered applications. 
The SGM3124 is available in a Green TQFN-3×3-16L 
package. It operates over an ambient temperature 
range of -40℃ to +85℃.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.
