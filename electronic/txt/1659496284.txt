GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM8198 series is a high-side, unipolar, current 
shunt monitor that operates from 2.7V to 36V single 
supply, consuming only 65µA quiescent current. The 
device also features a wide input common mode 
voltage range from 2.7V to 36V. Therefore, either side 
of the shunt current can be connected to the power 
supply, and the error is minimized. 
The SGM8198 is designed to set any gain from 1 to 
100 or more with one external resistor. Differential input 
voltage can be converted into output current, and the 
output current is converted back to voltage through load 
resistance. In addition to current shunt measurement, 
the device is also very suitable for measurement and 
level shifting. 
The SGM8198 is available in a Green SOT-23-5 
package. It is specified for the -40 ℃ to +125 ℃ 
temperature range.

FEATURE DESCRIPTION 
Overview 
The features of the SGM8198 are high voltage, 
precision measurement, precision resistors trimmed for 
meeting the absolute tolerance and the ability of low 
noise. Also, the SGM8198 can be powered by a single 
power supply and the input voltage level can exceed the 
supply voltage level. In addition, the SGM8198 can 
measure the small sense voltage at a higher common 
mode voltage level. The Functional Block Diagram 
illustrates the internal structure of the SGM8198. 
 
Range of Output Voltage 
The load resistor RL is used to convert the output 
current into voltage accurately. The maximum output 
swing of the SGM8198 is limited by the supply voltage, 
the common mode voltage, and the sense voltage. 
Bandwidth 
The value of the load resistor (RL) has a significant 
effect on the measurement bandwidth. A narrower 
measurement bandwidth due to high gain is generated 
by the high RL values. Therefore, the widest possible 
bandwidth can be obtained when the capacitive load on 
the output is kept to a minimum. For details of 
bandwidth reduction due to capacitive load, please 
refer to Typical Performance Characteristics. 
As shown in Figure 5, adding a capacitor to the output 
can achieve the bandwidth limitation (filtering). And this 
operation will not cause system instability. 
 
Device Functional Modes 
The device specifications are shown in Electrical 
Characteristics. For proper operation, the following 
recommendations 
should 
be 
met 
for 
operating 
SGM8198:  
 The device should be powered within the voltage 
range from 2.7V to 36V.  
 The input common mode voltage range is from 2.7V 
to 36V.

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
Operation 
The basic structure of SGM8198 is shown in Figure 3. 
The measured load current is drawn from the supply 
voltage of the SGM8198. The internal amplifier forces 
the current to flow into the drain of the MOSFET (M1). 
The load resistor RL is used to convert the output 
current into output voltage.

For accuracy measurement, the maximum sense 
voltage is limited to 0.5V, which can produce 500μA 
output current for the load. The maximum sense 
voltage that will not cause damage is 2V. For normal 
operation, the voltage applied to pin 3 should be 
greater than pin 4. If the applied voltage at pin 3 is 
smaller than that of pin 4, the SGM8198 will not be 
damaged and the output current is equal to 0μA.

Design Requirements 
Digitize the output of the SGM8198 device using a 
1MSPS Analog-to-Digital converter (ADC). 
 
Detailed Design Procedure 
Selecting RS and RL 
The choice of RS is related to the accuracy of the small 
input signal and the maximum allowable voltage drop 
across RS of the measured line. For measuring low 
current, a larger RS can be taken into account to 
minimize the effect of the offset voltage and then 
enhance the accuracy. Lower RS can reduce the 
voltage loss dramatically in supply line. The best 
performance of the SGM8198 for the sense voltage 
should be in the range of 50mV to 100mV, and the 
maximum allowable sense voltage for accurate 
measurement is 500mV, which can handle most of the 
applications.  
The desired output voltage for the SGM8198 is 
determined by the value of RL. Because of the high 
impedance structure of the SGM8198, the device 
allows the maximum resistance of RL to be 100kΩ. For 
enhancing the accuracy of the measurement, the input 
impedance of the external circuitry which is connected to 
the output of the SGM8198 should be much larger than 
100kΩ. 
The Analog-to-Digital converters (ADC) may have the 
input impedance that will affect the gain of the 
SGM8198 since it can be paralleled with RL. 
Alternatively, the buffer should be placed between the 
ADC and SGM8198. The output impedance of the 
SGM8198 is significant larger as it is a current source. 
The load resistor RL is used to convert the load current 
to the specific desired voltage. The ratio of the value of 
the load resistor to the internal resistor RG determines 
the voltage gain of the device. 
For most of the applications which need to digitize the 
output of the SGM8198, an ADC is required for 
completing this requirement. However, for the analog 
input stage of ADC, there is a dynamic input impedance 
which can be paralleled with RL and affect the voltage 
gain of SGM8198. Also, the accuracy of the SGM8198 
cannot be guaranteed for this situation. To avoid any 
external impedance which is paralleled with RL, a buffer 
should be placed between the output of SGM8198 and 
the analog input of ADC. The SGM8955 is a good 
choice for the buffer. 
Figure 4 shows how to digitize the output of SGM8198 
with an addition buffer. Between the output of the buffer 
and the input of the ADC, an RC filter can be added.  
The capacitor should provide any instantaneous 
current demand for the input stage of ADC. The resistor 
should be considered to isolate the buffer output from 
the load capacitor to enhance the stability. The values 
of the resistor and the capacitor for the filter should be 
varied for different selections of buffer and ADC.

Detailed Design Procedure 
Placing a capacitor which is paralleled with the load 
resistor RL can form an RC filter. First, select a suitable 
value of RL to achieve the desired voltage gain. Second, 
select a suitable value of CL to achieve the desired 
cutoff frequency with the equation shown in Figure 5.

gain settings with RL.

Offsetting the Output Voltage 
If the customers need to offset the output voltage away 
from GND when there is no load current flowing 
through RS for single power supply, SGMICRO 
recommends the following two methods, as shown in 
Figure 7. The voltage divider method is shown in the 
left hand side. This method can locate the level of 
output voltage at the center of VR when there is no 
current flowing through RS. With this method, the gain 
of the SGM8198 is determined by the parallel 
combination of R1 and R2 and the offset level is 
determined by the voltage divider of them. If the 
customers need a fixed offset level which is not related 
with its supply voltage, a constant current source can 
be taken into account. With this method, the gain is 
determined by RL and the offset voltage is determined 
by the multiplication product of constant current which 
is provided by the current source and the load resistor 
RL.

TYPICAL APPLICATIONS (Continued) 
Bipolar Current Measurement 
The following circuitry can be taken into account for the 
applications which needs to measure positive and 
negative current flowing through the RSH. The two 
inputs of each SGM8198 are connected at the two 
sides of RSH together. The comparator can indicate if 
the current flowing is positive or negative. The 
magnitude of the output voltage is determined by the 
resistor which is located between the labeled output 
and the GND. In this application, the 20V/V gain is 
generated by the 20kΩ resistor. The two 10kΩ resistors 
provide a voltage input for the SGM8740. In this 
example, there is only one SGM8198 can operate at a 
time as the two SGM8198 measures positive and 
negative current respectively, so two diodes should be 
placed at the output of them to prevent the current 
flowing into the output.

Bipolar Current Measurement Using a Differential Input of the A/D Converter 
The SGM8198 can be used with a programmable ADC and the input of the ADC is differential. The application is 
used to measure the positive and negative current flowing from VCC. The output voltage depends on the polarity of 
the measured current flowing, one of the outputs of SGM8198 must have a corresponding value and the other one is 
0V. In this method, the ADC can illustrate the polarity of the current without addition circuitry.

TYPICAL APPLICATIONS (Continued) 
Multiplexed Measurement Using Logic Signal for Power 
The following application is used to measure the multiples loads. The VCC pin of each SGM8198 is powered by the 
I/O pins of SGM58200, so as to control on or off for multiplexing.

Power Supply Recommendations 
The two input pins can measure the differential voltage accurately though their input common mode voltage which is 
higher than the supply voltage of the SGM8198. For instance, the two input pins can measure the current from a 
36V system with 5V power supply voltage. A 0.1μF bypass capacitor should be placed as close as possible to the 
supply pin. For noisy power supply applications, an additional capacitor will be required.

Layout 
Layout Guidelines 
The recommendation of PCB layout for SGM8198 is 
shown in Figure 11. The input pins of SGM8198 should 
be placed closely to the measured load current to 
minimize the resistance which is in series with the 
shunt resistor RS. The output resistor RL is connected 
between OUT and GND pins. For enhancing the 
accuracy of the measurement, the operator should 
measure the voltage at the RL directly. In some 
high-current systems, the high-current can flow into the 
ground connections, which may cause inaccuracy. 
The SGM8198 does not need any bypass capacitors 
for its stability. However, for noisy power supply, the 
capacitors are needed and should be placed as close 
as possible to the power supply pin for rejecting any 
noise from the power supply.
