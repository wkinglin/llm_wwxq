GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM41563 is a linear charger for single-cell Li+/ 
polymer battery plus an ultra-low standby current boost 
operation for generating a 5V output from the battery 
power. Its wide input range allows charging with loose 
regulated power like conducting coil, solar cells or 
thermal coupling piles. The boost quiescent current

standby application. 
The SGM41563 is available in a Green SOIC-8 (Exposed 
Pad) package.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
The SGM41563 has a linear battery charger block with 
low IQ boost operation which is biased from the BAT pin. It 
only consumes ultra-low quiescent current less than 1μA, 
which is designed for the always-on standby applications. 
The Linear Charger 
The charger block uses a CC/CV charge profile, plus 
the following added features for improving safety, 
suitability and availability: 
System Load Pre-charge: When power up in the 
situation that the battery terminal voltage is below the 
pre-condition voltage threshold, the output with 
maximum current limit for tSYS_PRE to provide enough 
current for the system to start up with no battery or with 
a battery in under-voltage protection state. 
Wide Available Input Range: Charging is kept when 
the input voltage is high or when the supply could not 
maintain enough voltage and current. The charge 
current is regulated for no over-heating the device or 
maintains minimum drop-out for no reverse leakage, 
even the current could not be maintained continuously. 
Voltage Fold-Back Power Retaining: When EOC 
condition is qualified, lower the output to a safe voltage 
while release the current limit to the maximum, retain 
powering the load system. The fold-back does not sink 
charge back out of the battery and avoids discharging 
and recharging cycling in continuous plugged-in 
situation. 
Floating Charge Time-Out: When charging with high 
system load that sinks more than the end of charge 
residual current, charging stops when the battery 
voltage stays higher than floating charge voltage for 
over tFLTING and turns in the end of charge fold-back 
power retaining. 
Over-Temperature Charge Regulation: The device 
senses temperature with its on-die sensing circuit. 
When the die temperature reaches TCUT, the charge 
current is reduced for maintaining the temperature. 
Path Resistive Loss Compensation and Charge 
Termination Current: Once the end of charge condition 
is detected the first time, the charge is turned to output 
VFB while the VBAT is checked; a drop is seen as the 
current in the charge path falls. If the drop is significant, 
more than VDCC, the output voltage is then increased to 
VRDC to compensate as the excessive loss drop 
detected. This allows using relative high residual 
current level for charge termination detection while the 
bigger portion of charge current goes into load instead 
of into current. 
Charging Procedure, Start, End of Charge, Power 
Retaining and Restart: There are two kinds of charge 
procedure, charging a battery cell without any battery 
protector and with a battery protector. The devices' 
native charging procedure is recorded with a battery 
without any protector, in which the system pre-charge, 
battery pre-charge, floating, end of charge and safe 
fold-back power retaining are included. When charging 
a battery with a protector, the start-end curve is affected 
by the protector's behavior and the residual battery 
voltage is kept by the protector, in which the BAT 
voltage raises too fast that no much difference to 
chargers with a battery FET. 
The charge procedure is provided as a constant current 
and constant voltage, with a system pre-charge at 
power up and a pre-condition charging if the battery 
voltage is lower than the fast charging threshold. The 
end of charge is qualified when the charge current falls 
to the termination current in the floating charge period 
or floating timer runs out of time, once or after the path 
resistive 
loss 
compensated. 
Charge 
procedure 
parameters are illustrated in Figure 3 as well, in which 
timing is not scaled for showing details in short time 
intervals. 
Charge Current Programming: The current passing 
through the VIN to BAT path is sampled and the current 
is proportional to the path current that is fed out of the 
IREF pin. The proportional current goes through the 
RIREF and makes a voltage drop over the RIREF 
proportional to the path current. The current regulation 
loop controls the path resistance to make the drop 
equal to an internal reference voltage unless the 
voltage regulation loop takes control. The current 
sample ratio, RIREF and the internal reference voltage 
decide the path current when the current loop takes 
control. The relationship between the RIREF and the 
path current is represented as: 
 
ICHG = 24000/RIREF (kΩ) for ICHG < 400mA 
 ICHG = 58(mA) + 20500/RIREF (kΩ) for ICHG > 400mA

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
The Boost Converter 
The boost block operates in peak-current PWM mode 
in normal load condition, and turns into power-saving 
skip mode in light load condition. The power input to 
load is disconnected when it is disabled by pulling EN 
low. 
In addition to the normal regulation, both the peak 
inductor current and the output voltage are monitored 
for over-current protection and short circuit protection. 
Whenever the peak current reaches ILIM, the low-side 
switch is turned off. Whenever the output voltage falls 
below 2.2V, the output is pre-charged through the 
high-side switch that has a current limit for about 
200mA. The switching operation stops whenever the 
output voltage is higher than the over-voltage 
protection threshold (VOV), or the die temperature is 
higher than the over-temperature threshold (TOT). 
Careful Handling to In-Rush and Out-Rush: In-rush 
voltage surge or out-rush voltage surge might occur 
and damage the low voltage pins BAT and VOUT 
during the battery attaching or the supply applying in 
production test in the always-on circuit showed in 
Figure 4.  
It is recommended to place TVS diodes clipping to the 
BAT pin and VOUT pin for surge absorption. However, 
if you decide not to use TVS diodes, the R1 and C6 are 
alternatives in the always-on application, which inserts 
a short delay to EN enabling after battery attaching or 
test supply contact, to avoid the boost starting during 
the voltage surge. The larger capacitances of C4 and 
C5, as shown in Figure 4, are recommended to 
lowering the out-rush voltage surge caused by load 
contact bouncing, which is usual situation in frequent 
load assertion applications like TWS case, where the 
load contact capacitance should be less than 1/10 of 
the total capacitances of the C4 and C5 practically.

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
The typical application circuit with the recommended 
component parameters is shown in Figure 1. The boost 
keeps stable if reducing the input decoupling 
capacitance and the output storage capacitance to half 
value if not care about the increasing of the output 
voltage ripple amplitude and the input current ripple 
amplitude. 
Inductor Selection: The low DCR inductor of 2.2μH 
with the saturation current and the thermal limited 
current > 1.4A is recommended. 
Layout Consideration: The inductor current alternates 
between the ground EP and the output storage 
capacitors C4 - C5, while the input decoupling 
capacitor C3 makes the return loop of the inductor 
current ripple. Refer to Figure 5; it makes the ripple 
current loop as small as possible for stable and low loss 
operation.
