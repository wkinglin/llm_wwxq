GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM2538 series of eFuses feature comprehensive 
protection functions, robust operation, accurate limit 
threshold and compact package which are very suitable 
for various system applications. 
The SGM2538 provides fixed over-voltage clamp 
(OVC), adjustable over-current protection (OCP) and 
fast short-circuit protection (SCP). The device also 
provides adjustable soft-start (SS) function to manage 
inrush current through external resistor. When the 
device junction temperature exceeds +155 ℃, the 
thermal shutdown function works and turns off the 
device. Once in thermal shutdown, the latch-off and 
auto-retry options are available. 
Besides the above features, the SGM2538 has 
additional configurable functions using the BFET pin. 
The BFET pin can be used to drive an external N-FET 
connected back to back with the internal pass FET to 
provide reverse current block (RCB) function. It can 
also be used as fault event indicator through an 
external transistor. 
The SGM2538 is available in a Green TDFN-3×3-10AL 
package.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
Overview 
The SGM2538 is intelligent eFuse with comprehensive 
built-in protection and regulation functions. The device 
is enabled and the internal pass FET is turned on when 
voltages on the both IN (VIN) and EN/UVLO (VEN/UVLO) 
pins exceed their UVLO thresholds. During the start-up 
process, the output voltage rises with the slew rate 
programmed through the external capacitor on the SS 
pin. The device is disabled and the pass FET is turned 
off when VIN or VEN/UVLO drops to their UVLO thresholds 
or other fault events occur. 
During the steady operation, the SGM2538 is 
continuously protected from various fault events. The 
over-voltage clamp (OVC) ensures the input voltage 
clamped to VOVC once voltage spikes occur. The 
over-current protection (OCP) function limits the output 
current to preset level accurately. When the current 
rises very rapidly under short-circuit condition, the 
short-circuit protection (SCP) works and turns off the 
device quickly. The above fault events may bring 
accumulated heat and cause the device temperature 
increase. To avoid over-temperature, the SGM2538 is 
integrated with thermal shutdown function. Once the 
junction temperature TJ exceeds the maximum level 
TSD (+155℃), the thermal shutdown is activated and 
the device is turned off. For SGM2538xL, the device 
remains turned-off until the power supply or EN/UVLO 
pin is reset (pulled low and then pulled up). For 
SGM2538xA, the device is designed with 170ms 
auto-retry after the TJ drops to TSD - 20 ℃. The 
auto-retry will repeat until the fault is removed. 
 
GND 
The GND pin is the common ground of the device. All 
the voltages are referenced to this pin. 
 
IN 
The IN pin is the input of the device which should be 
connected to the power source. It is recommended to 
place a ceramic bypass capacitor close to the IN pin to 
reduce bus transient. The maximum input voltage of 
SGM2538 is 20V. For SGM2538Ax, the recommended 
input voltage is 4.5V to 5.5V. For SGM2538Bx, the 
recommended range is 4.5V to 13.8V. If the input 
voltage 
exceeds 
the 
maximum 
recommended 
operating voltage, the over-voltage clamp (OVC) 
function will work and clamp the output voltage at VOVC. 
Under this condition, the device may heat up due to 
more power dissipation, which eventually activates 
thermal shutdown. 
 
SS 
The SS pin is designed to regulate the output slew rate 
during start-up process. Place a capacitor between SS 
and GND pins will set the ramp-up time according to 
the application requirements. This pin can be float, and 
the output obtains the default value (minimum tSS) 
under this condition. Equation 1 shows the calculation 
process.

Equation 2 shows how to calculate the total ramp time 
(tSS) when the output rises from 0V to VIN: 
 
tSS = 1.02 × 106 × VIN × CSS            (2) 
 
When CSS is open, there is a 70pF capacitor (CINT) 
inside. 
 
BFET 
The BFET pin features gate driver ability. When this pin 
is used to drive an external N-FET connected back to 
back with the internal pass FET, the system provides 
reverse current block (RCB) function. Both voltages on 
the IN (VIN) and EN/UVLO (VEN/UVLO) pins control the 
BFET pin. Table 1 shows the control logic where VUVR 
and VENR are the UVLO thresholds of VIN and VEN/UVLO 
respectively. The BFET pin provides 2μA charging 
current and fast discharging speed (typically < 1μs) 
through the internal 30Ω resistor. High-impedance 
probe (> 10MΩ) should be used when measuring this 
pin.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
EN/UVLO 
The EN/UVLO pin has two functions, namely enable 
and under-voltage lockout. When used as an enable 
pin, it controls the active and shutdown states of the 
internal pass FET and external blocking FET. Logic 
high (exceed VENR) enables the internal pass FET and 
controls BFET pin to charge the external N-FET. Logic 
low (below VENF) disables the internal pass FET and 
controls BFET pin to discharge the external N-MOSFET. 
The EN/UVLO levels are designed with hysteresis as 
specified in the electrical characteristic table.  
When used as a UVLO pin by connecting resistor 
divider from IN to EN/UVLO to GND, it can program 
different input voltage UVLO thresholds. 
The internal EN/UVLO falling edge de-glitch delay is 
1μs (TYP). If a higher de-glitch delay is desired, it is 
recommended to add an external bypass capacitor 
between EN/UVLO and GND pins. 
 
ILIM 
At all times, the load current is monitored by directly 
sensing the current flowing through the internal pass 
FET. The maximum power dissipation of device is 
restricted to constant 30W. During over-current event, 
the current is limited to the over-current limit (IOL) 
programmed by RILIM as shown in Equation 3. 
 
IOL = (0.92 + 2.8 × 10-5 × RILIM)           (3) 
 
Power dissipation of the internal MOSFET is calculated 
by PD = (VIN - VOUT) × IOUT. If it is set to constant 30W, 
the continue overload state will cause thermal 
shutdown. 
When a transient short-circuit is happened, due to the 
limited bandwidth of the current limit amplifier, it cannot 
respond quickly to this event, so the SGM2538 
contains a fast-trip comparator with a threshold 
(IFAST-TRIP). If IOUT > IFAST-TRIP, the comparator turns off 
the power FET and terminates the short-circuit peak 
current cross the power FET rapidly. The fast-trip 
threshold is 1.6 times of the overload current limit. The 
fast-trip comparator can terminate the transient 
short-circuit peak current, and then the current limit 
function limits the output current to IOL.

Output Discharge 
The SGM2538 provides an internal two-level output 
discharge when the device is disabled through 
EN/UVLO pin. When the initial output voltage is above 
7.5V, the output capacitor would be quickly discharged 
to 7.5V, and then slowly discharged to 0V. When the 
initial output voltage is below 7.5V, it will be slowly 
discharged to 0V.

Set Point for Under-Voltage Lockout 
Setting the external voltage divider of R1 and R2 will 
adjust the under-voltage lockout (UVLO) point of the 
device. The R1 and R2 resistors are placed among IN, 
EN/UVLO and GND pins. Equation 5 shows how to 
calculate these resistor values:

               (5)
 
When VENR exceeds the threshold (1.41V), the device is 
turned on. 
The values of R1 and R2 should be selected properly. If 
R1 and R2 are too small, it will cause considerable 
power loss from VIN. If R1 and R2 are too large, it will 
cause undesirable current leaked into the device pins. 
In this design, the default UVLO VUVR = 4.3V. Select R1 
= 1MΩ and R2 = 510kΩ. 
The falling edge of power supply is set to detect for 
power failure, and the threshold VPFAIL is usually 4% 
lower than the VUVR. Equation 6 shows the calculation. 
VPFAIL = 0.96 × VUVR           (6) 
where VUVR is 4.3V, power fail threshold is 4.13V. 
It should be noted that the EN/UVLO pin can only 
sustain voltage up to 7V. Therefore, if VIN is less than 
7V, the EN/UVLO can be connected to VIN directly. If VIN 
is greater than 7V, this pin must be connected to VIN 
and GND through the resistors divider (R1 and R2). 
 
Setting Output Ramp Time (tSS) 
The SGM2538 is designed to control the inrush current 
when the device is enabled or powered-on. The slew 
rate of the output voltage can be set by an external 
capacitor between the SS pin and GND defined at 
power-on. Calculating the CSS requires consideration of 
the two possible cases. 
Start-Up without Load: Only Charge the COUT 
Once the device starts up, the current flows through the 
device charges the output capacitor. This process 
causes the inrush current, and it can be calculated by 
Equation 7. Combining the voltage difference and the 
load current, the power is dissipated across the internal 
pass FET. Equation 8 shows how to calculate the 
average power dissipation during start-up:

Start-Up with Load: COUT and Load Draws Current 
During start-up, the load (RL(SU)) current ramps up 
proportionally with the increase of output voltage. The 
average power dissipation in the internal pass FET 
during charging time is shown in Equation 9 to Equation 
12.

where: 
PD(START_UP) is the total power dissipation during 
start-up. 
ISTART_UP is the total current during start-up. 
 
At the initial start-up stage, ISTART_UP is less than the 
overload limit level IOL. With the resistor load drawing 
more current, ISTART_UP increases continuously. Once 
ISTART_UP > IOL, the device limits the current to IOL and 
the total start-up time is determined by:

For a certain power loss during start-up, the thermal 
shutdown time must be greater than the ramp-up time 
tSS. As shown in Figure 6, when TJ = +85℃, the thermal 
shutdown time is infinite. Therefore, it is safe to use 857μs 
as start-up time without any load on output. 
Considering the start-up event with a 4Ω load, the 
additional power dissipation on the load is calculated

more than tSS. Therefore, it is still safe to use 857μs as 
start-up time with a 4Ω load.

standard value. 
 
Set Point for Under-Voltage Lockout 
The resistor divider R1 and R2 can be calculated by 
Equation 6. In this example, the UVLO set point is 
10.8V. Therefore, R1 = 1MΩ and R2 = 150kΩ can be 
selected, and the rising threshold VUV is 10.81V. 
The power failure threshold is detected on the falling 
edge of supply. This threshold voltage is 4% lower than 
VUV. For VUV = 10.81V, the power fail threshold VPFAIL is 
10.38V. 
 
Setting Output Ramp Time (tSS) 
For the design example, CSS is designed to be 22nF, 
and the parameters are calculated as follows:

Figure 12. Circuit Implementation with Quick Output Discharge Function 
For some applications, it is necessary to power down 
the load to a defined state to avoid undesirable events. 
The BFET pin of SGM2538 can be used to drive an 
external P-MOSFET to achieve quick output discharge 
function (see Figure 12). When the device is disabled, 
the BFET pin is pulled low, which turns on the Q1 to 
discharge the output voltage. The output discharge rate 
is determined by the product of the output capacitor 
and discharge resistance, namely COUT and RDCHG. 
 
Power Supply Recommendations 
The power supply range is 4.5V to 13.8V for 
SGM2538Bx. If the distance between the power supply 
and the device is more than a few inches, it is 
recommended to use a higher than 0.1μF input bypass 
capacitor. 
 
Transient Protection 
In case of turning off the internal MOSFET, such as 
VOUT hard short, thermal shutdown, etc., the current 
flow path is cut off. The energy stored in parasitic 
inductance 
generates 
voltage 
spike. 
The 
input 
inductance produces a positive voltage spike on the 
input, while the output inductance produces a negative 
voltage spike on the output. The voltage spike can 
exceed the absolute maximum ratings of the device if 
the following steps are not taken: 
 
Minimizing lead length and inductance into and 
OUT of the device, including GND connection. 
 
Schottky diode across the output to absorb 
negative spikes. 
 
A low value ceramic capacitor (CIN = 0.001μF to 
0.1μF) to absorb the energy. The approximate 
value of CIN can be calculated with Equation 23.

Figure 13. Circuit Implementation with Optional Protection Components 
 
Some applications may require the addition of a 
transient voltage suppressor (TVS) across the IN pin 
and GND to prevent transients from exceeding the 
absolute maximum ratings of the device. 
Ceramic capacitors, TVS and Schottky diodes are 
optional protection components. Optional components 
can be used to suppress transients as shown in Figure 
13. 
 
Layout Guidelines 
 
It is recommended to use a 0.01μF or larger 
ceramic decoupling capacitor between IN and 
GND pins. When the input power path inductance 
is too low to ignore in hot plug applications, the 
capacitor can be minimized. 
 
The path of high current carrying power should be 
as short as possible, which must size to withstand 
twice the load current. 
 
The GND pin must be connected to the PCB 
ground as short as possible. 
 
Connect the terminal of the RILIM, CSS and resistors 
for EN/UVLO to the GND pin with the shortest 
trace. These paths and switching signals should 
not have any coupling. 
 
The ceramic capacitors, TVS and Schottky diodes 
must be placed as close to the device as possible.
