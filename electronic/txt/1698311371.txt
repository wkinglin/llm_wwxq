GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM21102C is a single-pole/double-throw (SPDT) 
switch, which supports from 20MHz to 6.0GHz. The 
device has low insertion loss and high isolation. The 
device features make it suitable for high linearity 
applications. It also has the positive voltage operation 
with very low DC power consumption performance. 
The SGM21102C is available in a Green ULGA-1×1-6BL 
package. 
 
 
APPLICATIONS 
T/R Switch in 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac/ax WLAN and Bluetooth 
System 
Sub-1G RF System 
ISM Band Application 
 
 
 
FEATURES 
● Operating Frequency Range: 20MHz to 6.0GHz 
● GaAs pHEMT Process 
● P1dB: 33dBm (TYP) at 2.7V 
● Low Insertion Loss: 0.2dB (TYP) at 0.9GHz 
● Low DC Power Consumption 
● Available in a Green ULGA-1×1-6BL Package

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.
