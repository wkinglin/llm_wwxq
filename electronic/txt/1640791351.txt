NOVEMBER 2012 –REV. A. 2 
GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM9346 is a 6-channel, 6th-order output 
reconstruction filter which can operate from 3.3V to 
5.5V single power supply. It is designed to replace 
passive LC filters and drivers with an integrated device. 
Compared with typical passive solutions, the six 
6th-order Butterworth filters provide better image 
quality than typical passive solutions. Three channels 
are fixed Standard Definition (SD) filters while the rest 
three channels are configurable between High Definition 
(HD) or Standard Definition (SD) filters. 
The device has a 6dB gain, allowing DC- or 
AC-coupled output. SGM9346 can be DC-coupled or 
AC-coupled with input video signal to eliminate 
out-of-band noise, such as the output stage of DAC. 
Internal clamp circuitry may be used if AC-coupled 
inputs are required. 
SGM9346 is available in a Green TSSOP-20 package. 
It operates over an ambient temperature range of -40℃ 
to +85℃. 
FEATURES 
● Supply Voltage Range: 3.3V to 5.5V 
● Three Fixed 6th-Order Standard Definition Filters 
● Three Configurable 6th-Order SD/HD Filters 
● Internal Gain: 6dB 
● Clamp Mode Active with AC-Coupled Inputs 
● Clamp Mode Inactive with DC-Coupled Inputs 
● AC- or DC-Coupled Outputs 
● -40℃ to +85℃ Operating Temperature Range 
● Available in a Green TSSOP-20 Package

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.
