GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The 74AVCH2T45 is a 2-bit, dual-supply voltage level 
transceiver. The nA and nB are two data input-output 
ports, DIR is a direction control input, and VCCA and 
VCCB are dual-supply pins. The supply voltage of VCCA 
and VCCB can range from 0.8V to 3.6V, making the 
device suitable for translating among any of the 0.8V, 
1.2V, 1.5V, 1.8V, 2.5V and 3.3V voltage nodes. The nA 
and DIR signals are referenced to VCCA and nB signals 
are referenced to VCCB. 
When DIR is set high, it allows transmission from nA to 
nB. When DIR is set low, it allows transmission from nB 
to nA. In suspend mode, when either VCCA or VCCB input 
is at GND, both nA and nB are in the high-impedance 
state. 
This device is highly suitable for partial power-down 
applications using power-off leakage current (IOFF) circuit. 
When the device is powered down, the current backflow 
will be prevented from passing through the device. 
The active bus hold circuitry makes device unnecessary 
to use external pull-up/pull-down resistors by holding 
unused or floating data inputs at a valid logic level.

NOTES: 
1. For the I/O data, the input circuit is always active. 
2. The DIR pin is referenced to VCCA. 
3. If at least one of VCCA or VCCB is at GND level, the device 
enters suspend mode.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
1. Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum 
Ratings may cause permanent damage to the device. 
Exposure to absolute maximum rating conditions for extended 
periods may affect reliability. Functional operation of the 
device at any conditions beyond those indicated in the 
Recommended Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
2. The minimum input voltage ratings and output voltage 
ratings may be exceeded if the input and output current ratings 
are observed. 
3. The performance capability of a high-performance integrated 
circuit in conjunction with its thermal environment can create 
junction temperatures which are detrimental to reliability. 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.
