GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM61411 is a synchronous Buck converter with 
integrated switches. It can deliver up to 600mA to the 
output over a wide input voltage range of 5V to 42V. It 
is suitable for various industrial or automotive 
applications with high input voltage or for power 
conditioning from unregulated sources. Moreover, 
ultra-low shutdown current of only 0.6µA make it a 
suitable choice for battery-powered applications. 
SGM61411 features high efficiency over a wide load 
range. Other features include internal compensation, 
internal monotonic soft-start even with pre-biased 
output. Switching at 150kHz, the SGM61411 can 
prevent EMI noise problems, such as the ones found in 
AM radio, ADSL and PLC applications. 
Protection features include current limiting and 
short-circuit protection, thermal shutdown with auto 
recovery and output over-voltage protection. 
SGM61411 is available in a Green SOT-23-6 package.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.

PIN DESCRIPTION 
PIN 
NAME 
FUNCTION 
1 
BOOT 
Bootstrap pin is used to provide a drive voltage, higher than the input voltage, to the 
high-side power switch. Place a 0.47µF Boost capacitor (CBOOT) as close as possible to the 
IC between this pin and SW pin. 
2 
GND 
Ground pin is the reference for input and the regulated output voltages. Special layout 
considerations are required. 
3 
FB 
Feedback pin for programming the output voltage. The SGM61411 regulates the FB pin to 
0.8V. Connect the feedback resistor divider tap to this pin. If the FB voltage exceeds 111% of 
0.8V, over-voltage protection (OVP) will stop all PWM switching. 
4 
EN 
Enable pin should not be left open and it should not be driven above VIN + 0.3V. Device will 
operate when the EN pin is high and shut down when the EN pin is low. EN can be tied to 
VIN pin via a resistor if the shutdown feature is not required or to a logic input for controlling 
shutdown. 
5 
VIN 
VIN pin is connected to the input supply voltage and powers the internal control circuitry. This 
voltage is monitored by a UVLO lockout comparator. VIN is also connected to the drain of the 
converter high-side switch. Due to power switching, this pin has high di/dt transition edges 
and must be decoupled to the GND by input capacitors as close as possible to the GND pin 
to minimize the parasitic inductances. 
6 
SW 
Switching node pin is the output of the internal power converter and should be connected to 
the output inductor. Bootstrap capacitor also connects to this pin. This node should be kept 
small on the PCB to minimize capacitive coupling, noise coupling and radiation.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
Overview 
The SGM61411 is an internally compensated wide 
input range current mode controlled synchronous Buck 
converter. It is designed for high reliability and is 
particularly suitable for power conditioning from 
unregulated sources or battery-powered applications 
that need low shutdown current. It also features a 
forced PWM control mode in which the low-side 
MOSFET turns on when the high-side MOSFET is in its 
off state. If the device is disabled, the total consumption 
is typically 0.6μA. 
Figure 2 shows the simplified block diagram of the 
SGM61411. The two integrated MOSFET switches of 
the power stage are both over-current protected and can 
provide up to 600mA of continuous current for the load. 
Current limiting of the switches also prevents inductor 
current runaway. The converter switches are optimized 
for high efficiency at low duty cycle. 
At the beginning of each switching cycle, the high-side 
switch is turned on. This is the time that feedback 
voltage (VFB) is below the reference voltage (VREF) and 
power must be delivered to the output. After the 
on-period, the high-side switch is turned off and the 
low-side switch is turned on until the end of switching 
cycle. For reliable operation and preventing shoot 
through, a short dead time is always inserted between 
gate pulses of the converter complimentary switches. 
During dead time, both switch gates are kept off. 
The device is designed for safe monotonic start-up 
even if the output is pre-biased. 
If the junction temperature exceeds a maximum 
threshold (TSHDN, typically +145℃), thermal shutdown 
protection will happen and switching will stop. The 
device will automatically recover with soft-start when 
the junction temperature drops back well below the trip 
point. This hysteresis is typically 20℃. 
The SGM61411 has current limit on both the high-side 
and low-side MOSFET switches. When current limit is 
activated, SGM61411 will continue to provide its 
maximum output current and will not shut down or 
hiccup. In such a case, the junction temperature may 
rise rapidly and trigger thermal shutdown. 
During initial power-up of the device (soft-start), current 
limit is activated to prevent inductor current runaway 
while the output capacitor is charging to the desired 
VOUT. 
 
Peak-Current Mode (PWM Control) 
Figure 2 shows the functional block diagram and Figure 
3 shows the switching node operating waveforms of the 
SGM61411. Switching node voltage is generated by 
controlling the duty cycles of the complementary 
high-side and low-side switches. The high-side duty 
cycle is used as control parameter of the Buck 
converter to regulate output voltage and is defined as: 
D = tON/tSW, where tON is the high-side switch on-time 
and tSW is the switching period. When high-side switch 
is turned on, the SW pin voltage sharply rises towards 
VIN, and the inductor current (IL) starts ramping up with 
(VIN - VOUT)/L slope. When high-side switch is turned off, 
the low-side switch is turned on after a very short dead 
time to avoid shoot-through, and IL ramps down with 
-VOUT/L slope. In ideal case, the output voltage is 
proportional to the input voltage and duty cycle (D = 
VOUT/VIN) if component parasitics are ignored.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
In continuous conduction mode, SGM61411 operates 
at fixed-frequency using peak-current mode control 
scheme. The controller has an outer voltage feedback 
loop to get accurate DC voltage regulation. The output 
of the outer loop is fed to an inner peak-current control 
loop 
as 
reference 
command 
that 
adjusts 
the 
peak-current of the inductor. The inductor peak-current 
is sensed from the high-side switch and is compared to 
the peak-current reference to control the duty cycle. In 
other words, as soon as the inductor current reaches 
the reference peak-current determined by voltage loop, 
the high-side switch is turned off and the low-side 
switch is turned on after dead time. 
The internally compensated voltage feedback loop 
allows for simpler design, fewer external components, 
and stable operation with almost any combination of 
output capacitors. 
 
Forced PWM Control Mode 
The SGM61411 operates in forced PWM control mode 
at light load for low output voltage ripple, tight output 
voltage regulation, and constant switching frequency. 
When the inductor minimum current falls below zero, 
the SGM61411 won’t enter discontinuous conduction 
mode. It operates in forced PWM control mode. The 
low-side MOSFET turns on when the high-side 
MOSFET is turned off after dead time, and keeps on 
until the next clock to turn on high-side MOSFET. 
 
Floating Driver and Bootstrap Charging 
UVLO Protection 
The high-side MOSFET driver is powered by a floating 
supply provided by an external bootstrap capacitor. The 
bootstrap capacitor is charged and regulated to about 
5V by the dedicated internal bootstrap regulator. When 
the voltage between BOOT and SW nodes is below 
regulation, a PMOS pass transistor turns on and 
connects VIN and BOOT pins internally, otherwise it will 
turn off. The power supply for the floating driver has its 
own UVLO protection. The rising UVLO threshold is 
about 4.7V and with 380mV hysteresis, the falling 
threshold is about 4.32V. In case of UVLO, the 
reference voltage of the controller is reset to zero and 
after recovery a new soft-start process will start. 
 
Output Over-Voltage Protection (OVP) 
The SGM61411 contains an over-voltage comparator 
that monitors the FB pin voltage. The over-voltage 
threshold is approximately 111% of nominal FB voltage. 
When the voltage at the FB pin exceeds the 
over-voltage threshold (VOUT_OV), PWM switching will 
be stopped and both high-side and low-side switches 
will be turned off. If the over-voltage fault is removed, 
the regulator will automatically recover. 
The error amplifier is normally able to maintain 
regulation since the synchronous output stage has 
excellent sink and source capability. However it is not 
able to regulate output when the FB pin is disconnected 
or when the output is shorted to a higher supply like 
input supply. Also when VOUT is set to its minimum 
(0.8V) usually there is no voltage divider and VOUT is 
directly connected to FB through a resistor (R1 in the 
divider) and there is no resistor to ground (no R2). In 
such case and with no load, an internal current source 
of 5μA ~ 6μA from BOOT into the SW pin, which can 
slowly charge the output capacitor and pull VOUT up to 
VIN. Therefore a minimum load of at least 10μA must be 
always present on VOUT (for example an 80kΩ resistor: 
0.8V/10μA = 80kΩ). 
If the FB pin is disconnected, a tiny internal current 
source will force the voltage at the FB pin to rise above 
VOUT_OV that triggers over-voltage protection and 
disables the regulator to protect the loads from a 
significant over-voltage. Also, if by accident a higher 
external voltage is shorted to the output, VFB will rise 
above the over-voltage threshold and trigger an OVP 
event to protect the low-side switch.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Minimum High-side On/Off-Time 
The shortest duration for the high-side switch on-time 
(tON_MIN) is 100ns (TYP). For the off-time (tOFF_MIN) the 
minimum value is 100ns (TYP). The duty cycle (or 
equivalently the VOUT/VIN ratio) range in CCM operation 
is limited by tON_MIN and tOFF_MIN depending on the 
switching frequency. Note that at 150kHz the total cycle 
time is tSW = 6.67μs. 
The minimum and maximum duty cycles are given by 
Equations 1 and 2: 
DMIN = tON_MIN × fSW             (1) 
and 
DMAX = 1 - tOFF_MIN × fSW         (2)

             (4) 
 
Input Voltage 
The SGM61411 can operate efficiently for inputs as high 
as 42V. For CCM operation (continuous conduction 
mode) keep duty cycle between 2% and 98%. 
 
Output Voltage 
The output voltage can be stepped down to as low as 
the 0.8V reference voltage (VREF). As explained before, 
when the output voltage is set to 0.8V and there is no 
voltage divider, a minimum small load will be needed. 
An 80kΩ resistor to ground will prevent the output 
voltage floating up. 
 
Soft-Start 
Soft-start is necessary to limits the input inrush current 
right after power-up or enabling the device. Soft-start is 
implemented by slowly ramping up the reference 
voltage that in turn slowly ramps up the output voltage 
to its target regulation value. 
 
Enable 
EN pin turns the SGM61411 operation in on or off 
condition. If an applied voltage less than 0.6V, the 
device will shut down. If the voltage more than 1.3V, the 
device will start the regulator. The EN pin is an input 
and must not be left open. The simplest way to enable 
the device is to connect the EN pin to VIN pin via a 
resistor. This enables the SGM61411 to start up 
automatically when VIN is within the operating range. 
An external logic signal can be used to drive the EN 
input for power savings, power supply sequencing 
and/or protection. If the EN pin is driven by an external 
logic signal, a 10kΩ resistor in series with the input is 
recommended. 
Note: Voltage on the EN pin should never exceed VIN + 
0.3V. Do not drive the EN pin with a logic level if VIN is 
not present. This can damage the EN pin and the 
device. 
 
Thermal Shutdown 
Thermal protection is designed to protect the die 
against 
overheating 
damage. 
If 
the 
junction 
temperature exceeds +145℃, the switching stops and 
the device shuts down. Automatic recovery with an 
internal soft-start will begin when the junction 
temperature drops below the +125℃ falling threshold.

Output Voltage Programming 
Output voltage can be set with a resistor divider 
feedback network between output and FB pin as shown 
in Figure 4 and Figure 5. Usually, a design is started by 
selecting lower resistor R1 and calculating R2 with the 
following equation: 


× 



1
OUT
REF
2
R
V
 = V
 
 1 + R
               (5) 
where VREF = 0.8V. 
To keep operating quiescent current small and prevent 
voltage errors due to leakage currents, it 
is 
recommended to choose R1 in the range of 10kΩ to 
200kΩ. 
If the output has no load other than the FB divider, 
make sure the divider draws at least 10μA from VOUT or 
an internal current source (5μA ~ 6μA) from BOOT to 
SW will slowly charge the output capacitor beyond the 
desired voltage. 
 
Inductor Selection 
Higher operating frequency allows the designer to 
choose smaller inductor and capacitor values; however, 
the switching and gate losses are increased. On the 
other hand, at lower frequencies the current ripple (∆IL) 
is higher, which results in higher light load losses. Use 
Equation 6 to calculate the required inductance (LMIN). 
K is the ratio of the inductor peak-to-peak ripple (∆IL) to 
the maximum operating DC current (IOUT). The 
recommended selection range for K is between 0.2 and 
0.4. Choosing a higher K value reduces the selected 
inductance, but a too high K factor may result in 
insufficient slope compensation. The inductance is 
selected based on the desired peak-to-peak ripple 
current (ΔIL) for CCM. Equation 7 shows that ∆IL is 
inversely proportional to fSW × L and is increased at the 
maximum input voltage (VIN_MAX). Therefore by 
accepting larger ∆IL values, smaller inductances can be 
chosen but the cost is higher output voltage ripple and 
increased core losses. 
Inductor peak-current should never exceed the 
saturation even in transients to avoid over-current 
protection. Also inductor RMS rating should always be 
larger than operating RMS current even at maximum 
ambient temperature.

where KIND = ΔIL/IOUT (DC Current, MAX). 
Note that it is generally desired to choose a smaller 
inductance value to have faster transient response, 
smaller size, and lower DCR. On the other hand, if the 
inductance is too small, current ripple will increase 
which can trigger over-current protection. Larger 
inductor current ripple also implies larger output voltage 
ripple 
with 
the 
same 
output 
capacitors. 
For 
peak-current mode control, it is recommended to 
choose large current ripple, because controller 
comparator performs better with higher signal to noise 
ratio. So, for this design example, KIND = 0.4 is chosen, 
and the minimum inductor value for 12V input voltage is 
calculated to be 76µH. The nearest standard value 
would be an 82µH ferrite inductor with a 1A RMS 
current rating and 1.5A saturation current that are well 
above the designed converter output current RMS and 
DC respectively. 
 
Bootstrap Capacitor Selection 
The SGM61411 requires a small external bootstrap 
capacitor, CBOOT, between the BOOT and SW pins to 
provide the gate drive supply voltage for the high-side 
MOSFET. The bootstrap capacitor is refreshed when 
the high-side MOSFET is off and the low-side switch 
conducts. An X7R or X5R 0.47µF ceramic capacitor 
with a voltage rating of 16V or higher is recommended 
for stable operating performance over-temperature and 
voltage variations.

APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued) 
Input Capacitor Selection 
The input capacitor also provides the switching 
transient currents. So, choosing a low-ESR and small 
size capacitor with high self-resonance frequency and 
sufficient RMS rating is necessary. Typically, 10μF high 
quality ceramic capacitor (X5R, X7R or better) with 
voltage rating twice the maximum input voltage is 
recommended for decoupling capacitor. If the source is 
away from the device (> 5cm) some bulk capacitance is 
also needed to damp the voltage spikes caused by the 
wiring or PCB trace parasitic inductances. The value for 
this capacitor is not critical but must be rated to handle 
the maximum input voltage including ripple. 
In this example, one 10μF/50V/X7R capacitors and a 
0.1μF ceramic capacitor placed right beside the device 
VIN and GND pins for very high-frequency filtering are 
used. 
 
Output Capacitor Selection 
This device is designed to be used with external LC 
filters. The minimum required capacitance to keep cost 
and size down and bandwidth high. The main factors 
for designing COUT are output voltage ripple, control 
loop stability and the magnitude of output voltage 
overshoot/undershoot after a load transients. So, COUT 
should be chosen carefully. The output voltage ripple 
has two main components. One is due to the ac current 
(ΔIL) going through the capacitor ESR: 
ΔVOUT_ESR = ΔIL × ESR = KIND × IOUT × ESR   (8) 
and the other one is caused by the charge and 
discharge of capacitor by the ac current (ΔIL):

    (9) 
These AC components are not in phase and the total 
peak-to-peak ripple is less than ΔVOUT_ESR + ΔVOUT_C. 
Transient performance specification usually limits 
output capacitance if the system requires tight voltage 
regulation in presence of large current steps and/or fast 
slew rate. The output capacitor must provide the 
increased load current or absorb the excess inductor 
current (when the load current steps down) until the 
control loop can re-adjust the current of the inductor to 
the new load level. The control loop of regulator usually 
requires 8 or more clock cycles to adjust the inductance 
current to the new load level. The output capacitance 
must be as large as possible to provide a current 
difference of 8 clock cycles to keep the output voltage 
within the specified range. Equation 10 shows the 
minimum output capacitance required to specify output 
overshoot/undershoot.

where: 
IOL = Low level of the output current step during load

IOH = High level of the output current during load 
transient. 
VOUT_SHOOT = Target output voltage overshoot/undershoot. 
In this example, maximum acceptable ripple is 30mV. 
Assuming ΔVOUT_ESR = ΔVOUT_C = 30mV and KIND = 0.4. 
Equation 8 results in ESR < 125mΩ and Equation 9 
leads to COUT > 6.25μF. If the overshoot/undershoot 
transient requirement is 5% then ΔVOUT_SHOOT = 5% × 
VOUT = 250mV. Equations 10, half load (0.3A) to full 
load (0.6A) transient, lead to COUT > 30μF. So, in 
summary, the most stringent criteria for the output 
capacitor is transient constrain of COUT > 30μF. For the 
derating margin, two 22μF, 10V, X7R ceramic capacitor 
with 10mΩ ESR is used.

Layout Guide 
Careful layout is always important to ensure good performance and stable operation to any kind of switching 
regulator. Place the capacitors close to the device, use the GND pin of the device as the center of star-connection to 
other grounds, and minimize the trace area of the SW node. With smaller transient current loops, lower parasitic 
ringing will be achieved.
