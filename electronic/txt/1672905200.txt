DECEMBER2022–REV.B 
GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM6611 family includes the SGM6611A and the 
SGM6611B. The SGM6611 is a fully-integrated 
synchronous Boost converter. The 2.7V to 12V 
operating input voltage is suitable for single-cell or 
two-cell Li-Ion/Polymer batteries. This device is capable 
of providing 7A continuous switch current and an output 
voltage range of 4.5V to 12.6V. It also has an 
adjustable switching frequency ranging from 200kHz to 
2.2MHz. 
The SGM6611 family has two operation modes, the 
pulse width modulation (PWM) mode and pulse 
frequency modulation (PFM). The SGM6611 family 
adopts the PWM mode at moderate to heavy load. The 
PFM mode is applied at light load by SGM6611A to 
improve the efficiency. However, the SGM6611B still 
adopts the PWM mode to prevent the device from low 
switching frequency faults. The protection features 
include output over-voltage protection at 13.2V, 
cycle-by-cycle over-current protection and thermal 
shutdown. The device also involves the functions of 
4ms built-in soft-start and adjustable switch peak 
current limit.  
The SGM6611A and SGM6611B are both available in a 
Green TQFN-2×2.5-11L package.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
The SGM6611 family is a synchronous Boost converter 
with two integrated power FETs and is capable of 
delivering up to 9.5A (TYP) switch current. The device 
has adjustable switching frequency ranging from 
200kHz to 2.2MHz. The SGM6611 automatically 
operates in pulse frequency modulation (PFM) mode at 
light load to improve the efficiency. In moderate to 
heavy load conditions, SGM6611 works at a constant 
frequency pulse width modulation (PWM) mode. In light 
load condition, the SGM6611A works in pulse 
frequency modulation (PFM) mode and the SGM6611B 
works in forced PWM (FPWM) mode. The device 
provides excellent line and load transient responses, in 
addition, the compensation network is configured 
externally which brings flexibility to applications with 
different inductor and output capacitor selections. The 
device also implements various protection features 
such as cycle-by-cycle current limit for abnormal load 
conditions, output over-voltage protection and thermal 
shutdown.  
 
Enable and Disable 
The input voltage applied to SGM6611 needs to be 
higher than the maximum UVLO threshold of 2.5V and 
the EN pin voltage is higher than 1.2V to enable the 
device. Pulling the EN pin below 0.4V disables the 
device, where all internal blocks are turned off, and no 
voltage is present on VCC pin. While disabled, the 
device stops switching and enters shutdown mode, 
which only consumes less than 1.1μA current. VIN and 
VOUT are connected through the body diode of the 
high-side rectifier FET in the shutdown mode. 
 
Adjustable Switching Frequency 
SGM6611 also has an adjustable switching frequency 
ranging from 200kHz to 2.2MHz. A resistor between the 
FSW pin and the GND pin is used to set the switch 
frequency. And do not leave the FSW pin open. 
Equation 1 is used to calculate the resistor.

where RFREQ is the resistor connected between the 
FSW pin and the GND pin, CFREQ = 30pF, tDELAY = 86ns, 
and fSW is the desired switching frequency. 
 
Adjustable Peak Current Limit 
The peak current mode control provides inherent 
over-current protection as the device monitors the 
changes of inductor current. As the peak current 
reaches 9.5A (TYP), the device stops switching and 
turning off the low-side FET to stop inductor current to 
rise. The peak current limit threshold is programmable 
via a resistor connected on ILIM pin to ground. Use 
Equation below to calculate the desired current limit 
threshold.

where RILIM is the resistor connected between the ILIM 
pin and ground, and ILIM is the switch peak current limit. 
When ILIM is 9.5A (TYP), the resistor value for 
SGM6611A is 127kΩ. 
 
Soft-Start 
The SGM6611 implements internal soft-start function of 
4ms (TYP). When enabled, the device slowly ramps the 
reference voltage to prevent large inrush current during 
startup.  
 
Under-Voltage Lockout (UVLO) 
An under-voltage lockout (UVLO) circuit prevents the 
device from malfunctioning at low input voltage and the 
battery from excessive discharge. The SGM6611 has 
both VIN UVLO function and VCC UVLO function. It 
disables the device from switching when the falling 
voltage at the VIN pin trips the UVLO threshold VIN_UVLO, 
which is typically 2.4V. The input UVLO function 
implements a 100mV hysteresis to prevent the false 
turn-on due to line voltage variations, where the device 
cannot be turned on until the input voltage increases to 
2.5V or higher. When the falling voltage at the VCC pin 
trips the UVLO threshold VCC_UVLO, typically 2.1V, the 
device is also disabled. 
 
Over-Voltage Protection (OVP) 
The device implements over-voltage protection to 
prevent the device from damage and protect the device 
connected to the output of SGM6611. When the 
voltage present on the VOUT pin exceeds 13.2V (TYP), 
the device stops switching immediately to prevent the 
output voltage from rising. As the output voltage drops 
below 150mV (TYP) of hysteresis voltage that is lower 
than the OVP threshold, the device resumes operation.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Thermal Shutdown 
A thermal shutdown function is implemented to prevent 
damage caused by excessive heat and power 
dissipation. Once a junction temperature of +160℃
(TYP) is exceeded, the device is shut down. The device 
is released from shutdown automatically when the 
junction temperature decreases by 20℃. 
 
Device Functional Modes 
Operation 
The SGM6611 adopts the fixed frequency pulse width 
modulation (PWM) mode in moderate to heavy load 
condition. At the start of each clock cycle, the low-side 
power FET is turned on to ramp up the inductor current 
until the inductor current reaches the level determined 
by the output of the internal error amplifier. When the 
current is reached, LS FET is turned off, and a dead 
time is issued which is used to prevent shoot-through. 
During the dead time, the inductor current flows 
through the body diode of the high-side FET. As the 
dead time ends, the high-side FET is turned on to ramp 
down the inductor current to replenish the output 
capacitor and deliver current to the load.  
The SGM6611A operates in PFM mode for applications 
with high efficiency requirement at light load. And the 
SGM6611B operates in forced PWM mode to avoid 
switching noise for applications with fixed switching 
frequency requirement. 
 
Forced PWM Mode 
For forced PWM mode, the switching frequency of 
SGM6611B is fixed at light load. The internal error 
amplifier output drops along with the load current. 
When the output current further decreases, the current 
of the inductor can be reduced to zero during turn-off. 
The high-side N-MOSFET remains open even when 
the current is zero, with only inductor current direction 
changed. The efficiency is low in forced PWM mode. 
However, no problems are caused by the low efficiency 
in forced PWM mode, such as the audible noise. 
 
PFM Mode 
In order to improve the light load efficiency, the 
SGM6611A implements PFM operation at light load. At 
light load, the internal error amplifier’s output decreases 
to lower the inductor current. As the current reaches 
zero during the low-side off-time, the high-side FET 
turns off till the next switching cycle starts. As the load 
current decreases further, the output of the error 
amplifier reaches a voltage that is corresponds to 
ILIM/10. The output of the error amplifier is clamped at 
this value and no longer decreases. The SGM6611A 
automatically adjusts the off-time in PFM mode to meet 
the load demand, and lower load current results in 
longer off-time. The output voltage is regulated to 0.2% 
higher than the nominal programmed output voltage at 
PFM mode. The SGM6611A is capable of achieving 
above 70% efficiency when the load current is less than 
1mA. Output voltage ripple is also lower in PFM mode 
since the peak inductor current is lower.

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
The SGM6611 family is capable of supporting up to 
12.6V output voltage, while providing 9.5A (TYP) 
continuous switch current. At heavy load, the device 
works in PWM mode. At light load, the SGM6611A 
works in the PFM mode and the SGM6611B works in 
the forced PWM mode. The peak current control 
scheme provides excellent line and load transient 
responses. The external loop compensation enables 
design flexibility with various inductor and output 
capacitor combinations. It also supports adjustable 
switching frequency ranging from 200kHz to 2.2MHz.

A standard 127kΩ provides the 9.5A typical current 
limit. Considering variation due to tolerance and 
temperature, the worst-case required peak current 
should be lower than the minimal current limit rating to 
ensure that the SGM6611 can regulate the output 
voltage. For Boost converter, the worst case occurs at 
the lowest VIN and the highest load current.

Inductor Selection 
Inductor is an essential element for DC/DC switch 
mode power supplies regardless of topology. Inductor 
serves as the energy storage element for power 
conversion. Inductance and inductor’s saturation 
current are the two most important criterions for 
inductor selection. For general rule of thumb, the 
selected inductance should provide a peak-to-peak 
ripple current that is around 30% of the average 
inductor current at full load and nominal input voltage. 
The average inductor current for a Boost converter is 
the input current. The SGM6611 is optimized to work 
with inductor values between 0.47μH and 10μH. Lower 
inductance part generally has smaller size while 
providing sufficient saturation current rating, and larger 
inductance provides lower peak-to-peak ripple current, 
which helps to maximize the output current delivery.  
Equations 6 to 8 show the calculated key parameters 
for selecting the inductor. The selected inductor should 
meet the worst case that occurs at minimum input 
voltage and maximal load current. Margin should be 
added to cover inductance de-rating and conversion 
efficiency. 
For Boost converter, the average inductor current is the 
average input current, Equation 6 is used to calculate 
the average inductor current:

where IPP is the inductor peak-to-peak ripple, L is the

plus half of the peak-to-peak inductor current shown in 
Equation 8:

The selected inductor should have the saturation 
current rating higher than the calculated peak current, 
and the calculated peak current should be lower than 
the peak current limit of SGM6611.  
Inductor’s DCR, material type, DC/DC’s power FET 
resistance and switching speed affect the overall 
efficiency of the converter, therefore, careful inductor 
selection is critical to ensure good performance.

Input Capacitor Selection 
Boost converter’s input capacitor has continuous 
current throughout the entire switching cycle. A 10µF 
ceramic capacitor is recommended to place between 
the VIN pin and GND pin of SGM6611 as close as 
possible. For the applications where the SGM6611 is 
located far away from the input source, a 47µF or 
higher capacitance capacitor is recommended to damp 
the wiring harness’s inductance. 
The VCC pin is the output of the internal regulator, a 
1µF ceramic capacitor is recommended to place on the 
VCC pin. 
 
Output Capacitor Selection 
The output capacitors of Boost converter dictate the 
output voltage ripple and load transient response. 
Equation 9 is used to estimate the necessary 
capacitance to achieve the desired output voltage 
ripple, where ΔV is the maximum allowed ripple. Three 
22μF ceramic output capacitors are recommended for 
SGM6611. Due to the DC de-rating effect of the 
ceramic capacitor, margin should be considered, where 
higher capacitance improves the transient response.

Loop Stability 
The compensation network of SGM6611 is completed 
externally to improve design flexibility. The SGM6611 
implements a transconductance error amplifier, where 
the COMP pin is the output of the internal error 
amplifier. A Type-II compensation network consisting of 
R5, C5 and C6 connected on COMP pin is used to 
configure the loop response of SGM6611. 
The power stage small signal loop response of peak

Once the error amplifier and power stage’s poles and

component value can be designed. The designed loop 
crossover frequency fC should be within 1/5 of the 
RHPZ frequency (fRHPZ) or 1/10 of the switching 
frequency. Higher crossover frequency could improve 
the transient response. However, the crossover 
frequency should be designed to avoid instability.

Layout Guidelines 
In addition to component selection, layout is a critical 
step to ensure the performance of any switch mode 
power supplies. Poor layout could result in system 
instability, EMI failure, and device damage. Thus, place 
the inductor, input and output capacitors as close to the 
IC as possible, and use wide and short traces for 
current carrying traces to minimize PCB inductance. 
For Boost converter, the output capacitor’s current loop 
from VOUT pin back to the GND pin of the device 
should be as small as possible. Use small traces and 
small copper area of all traces connected to the SW 
node to minimize SW node vias and to prevent 
radiation 
of 
high-frequency 
noise. 
It 
is 
also 
recommended to place a ground plane below the 
DC/DC to minimize inter plane coupling.
