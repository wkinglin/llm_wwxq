GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM62180 is a two-phase, synchronous Buck 
DC/DC converter with integrated power MOSFETs 
using two identical current balanced phases with peak 
current mode control. The SGM62180 is a perfect low 
profile solution for height restricted applications. 
The Buck converter operates with phase delay to 
minimize the required input capacitance and reduce the 
EMI generation. 
With a wide 4.5V to 16V input voltage range and a very 
low quiescent current (30μA), the SGM62180 is well 
suitable for systems powered by multi-cell Li-Ion 
batteries, particularly for 12V applications. It can deliver 
6A continuous current which is equally shared between 
the phases. Dividing current between two phases 
allows the use of thinner inductors required for low 
profile designs. 
The efficiency is automatically maximized in the full 
duty cycle range by adjusting the switching frequency 
to the optimal value depending on VIN and VOUT. The 
loss is also minimized at very light loads by the 
automatic activation of the power-save mode (PSM). 
Other features include tracking, adjustable soft-start 
time, and power-good output signal. The SGM62180 
can operate with 100% duty cycle for very low dropout. 
It is also capable to work at high step-down ratios 
without duty cycle limitation. 
This device is available in a tiny 24-bump Green 
WLCSP package with 0.5mm pin pitch.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
Overview 
The SGM62180 is an efficient two-phase synchronous 
Buck converter with peak current mode control. It is a 
perfect choice for low-profile and minimal solution size 
designs which are typically needed in applications 
converting multi-cell Li-Ion sources to 0.9V to 6V 
outputs. The regulator is internally compensated. The 
inner current loop of each phase controls the peak 
inductor current in each cycle independently. The 
switching frequency is automatically adapted by an 
off-time controller to achieve efficiency maximization 
over the full load and duty cycle range, and also to 
change the operating mode into the PSM in light loads. 
In the steady state condition, the switching frequency is 
unchanged and is set depending on VIN and VOUT. 
The load current is equally shared between the two 
phases of the SGM62180. The two phases are built 
identically and the control loop of the follower phase is 
connected with a fixed delay to the control loop of the 
master phase. Both phases have the same regulation 
thresholds and peak current set points to ensure a 
phase-shifted current-balanced operation. Due to this 
dual phase topology, the SGM62180 can provide 
continuous 6A output current in a very small solution 
size with high conversion performance. 
 
Under-Voltage Lockout (UVLO) 
The under-voltage lockout (UVLO) is a necessary feature 
to avoid malfunctioning of the internal circuits due to 
insufficient supply. If the input voltage falls below the 
UVLO threshold, the device will be shut down. The 
UVLO falling threshold is 3.7V (TYP). It has a 270mV 
hysteresis band (TYP) for turning on. There is a 1ms 
delay for enabling the device after VIN exceeds the 
UVLO rising threshold. The power supply UVLO 
threshold can be adjusted above the 3.7V device 
threshold using the EN pin. See the Application 
Information section for details. 
 
Enable/Shutdown (EN) 
Conversion is started when a proper input voltage is 
present on VIN and the enable input (EN) is set to high. 
The rising (1.03V) and falling (0.93V) thresholds are 
very convenient for precise on/off control, UVLO 
adjustment and power sequencing. It is also suitable for 
slow rising EN signals. The EN voltage can be pulled 
down by a 350kΩ internal resistor to keep the device in 
off state if the EN pin is left open. 
By pulling the EN voltage below 0.93V, the device is 
disabled, and a 60Ω discharge resistor is connected 
between the output (VO) pin and ground. 
To keep the device enabled, the EN pin can be 
connected to VIN pin. In this case, a 1ms turn-on delay 
is inserted after VIN exceeds VUVLO and before soft-start 
(switching) ensures safe operation. 
 
Power-Good (PG) 
The power-good (PG) is an open-drain output that is 
provided to signal the status of the output voltage to the 
downstream system. The PG goes high when the VOUT 
reaches to a narrow margin just below the programmed 
regulated output voltage. It will be pulled down 
immediately if the output goes out of regulation due to 
an overload or other reasons such as UVLO, thermal 
shutdown or disabling by EN pin. The PG pin can sink 
to around 2mA and must be pulled up by a resistor 
unless PG function is not used.

Soft-Start/Tracking (SS/TR) 
To avoid large inrush currents, this device is used for 
monotonic output ramp even in the presence of a 
pre-bias on the output. Limiting VOUT slope also helps 
unwanted voltage drops if the input supply impedance 
is high. Every time the EN input goes high, the device 
switching is initiated and VOUT starts to rise with a 
controlled slope. The rate is selected by an external 
capacitor (CSS) connected between the SS/TR pin and 
AGND. The CSS is charged by an internal 5µA current

The SGM62180 has the capability to track an external 
voltage connected to the SS/TR pin. See the Tracking 
section for details. 
 
Thermal Shutdown 
To avoid damage from overheating, the junction 
temperature is continuously monitored. And if the 
temperature exceeds the shutdown level (TSD = +155℃, 
TYP), all power switches are turned off immediately 
and the discharge resistor is connected to the output. 
The PG is also pulled low. When the device is cooled 
off for 20℃ (typical hysteresis), the device automatically 
resumes normal operation after a soft-start. 
 
Operating Modes 
The SGM62180 output is regulated using a predictive 
off-time peak current mode control. With heavy loads, it 
works with PWM in the continuous conduction mode 
(CCM). But for light load, the converter starts to operate 
in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) and the 
operation mode is switched to the PSM to minimize 
losses. The transition between PWM and PSM is 
automatically managed by the device. 
 
Pulse Width Modulation Mode 
In the PWM mode, the efficiency is maximized over the 
whole VIN and VOUT ranges by automatic adjustment of 
the off-time (tOFF), based on the VIN and VOUT values. 
The predicted value is calculated by Equation 2:

                (3)

           (4) 
For example, when VIN = 12V and VOUT = 3.3V, the 
switching frequency is fs = 1.75MHz. And for VOUT = 1V, 
it is 733kHz. 
The master and follower phases have separate current 
control loops but use the same peak current set point 
for cycle by cycle peak current control and regulate 
their outputs to the same VOUT level. Using the same 
current set points, the current peaks of the two phases 
are very well balanced and are not dependent on the 
inductor’s DCR that may have large tolerances. The 
follower phase switches with a fixed delay after the 
master to get the phase shift advantages such as 
reduced input current ripple. 
 
Power-Save Mode (PSM) 
As the load is reduced, the internal error amplifier (EA) 
output is decreased. When it reaches to a preset fixed 
threshold, the light load condition is detected and the 
converter operation mode is changed from PWM to the 
PSM. In PSM, the converter frequency is reduced to 
minimize losses and the quiescent current. In this mode, 
the device employs a fixed peak current mode control 
technique, in which the peak current (IPEAK) is 
determined by VIN, VOUT and L. In this technique, the 
HS switch is turned off when the inductor current 
reaches to the fixed peak threshold. And then the LS 
switch is turned on to conduct the inductor current. The 
HS switch will not turn on again until VOUT falls to an 
internally preset low level (VOUT_LOW). At very light loads, 
only one phase, either master or follower, may operate 
and remain active. 
In PSM, the switching frequency can be calculated by 
Equation 5:

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
100% Duty Cycle Mode 
The maximum on-time is not limited in the SGM62180. 
If VIN ≈ VOUT, the device switches into the 100% duty 
cycle operation mode in which the HS switch is 
continuously kept on and the LS switch is kept off as 
long as VOUT stays below its programmed value. The 
lowest VIN value to keep the output regulation can be 
calculated from Equation 6: 
 
 (6) 
The 100% duty cycle mode provides output regulation 
even with very small room that is specifically useful 
when the battery is depleted in the battery powered 
applications. 
 
Automatic Efficiency Maximization (AEM) 
The SGM62180 automatically adjusts the switching 
frequency to maximize its efficiency over the full input 
and output voltage range using the off-time predictive 
algorithm given in the Equation 2. Normally, the power 
losses of a switching converter are increased when the 
VOUT is decreased and/or VIN is increased. To reduce 
the losses (increase the efficiency), the switching 
frequency can be reduced when VIN is high or VOUT is 
low. 
The efficiency enhancement is achieved over all duty 
cycles range. The efficiency improvement is especially 
noticeable at lower VOUT values where the efficiency of 
a conventional fixed frequency converter drops 
significantly. 
Moreover, by reducing the frequency at high VIN/VOUT 
ratios (small duty cycle), the on-time will remain above 
the marginal limits and the operating control range of 
the converter is extended. The minimum on-time for the 
high-side switches is about 100ns. Therefore, with the 
SGM62180 automatic efficiency maximization feature, 
operating at higher voltage ratios are possible 
compared with a similar fixed frequency converter. 
 
Phase Shifting 
There is an almost 280ns (TYP) fixed delay between 
the two phases in the PWM mode. Having a shift 
between converter phases reduces the RMS of the 
switching pulse currents at the input of the converter 
that is supplied by the input capacitors. Because the 
input 
RMS 
current 
is 
reduced, 
smaller 
input 
capacitance is needed and the high frequency noise is 
reduced. In PSM, the phase shift is about 130ns when 
both phases are operating. 
 
Current Protections 
This device features current limiting, current balancing 
and short circuit protections. Peak current in each 
phase is limited independently but with equal levels. If 
the peak current limit is reached due to an overload or 
short circuit, the maximum current is provided for about 
1ms and FB voltage decreases to 50% of the reference 
voltage. If the overload condition is not removed, the 
output starts hiccup and is turned off for about 5ms. 
After the 5ms off period, the device is restarted with a 
soft-start cycle. If the overload or short circuit condition 
is still present, the same hiccup cycle will repeat until 
the fault is removed. 
 
Tracking 
The SGM62180 has voltage tracking capability in which 
VOUT can track the voltage applied at the SS/TR pin. 
The tracking input voltage of the SS/TR pin ranges from 
50mV to 1.2V. The output is set such that the VFB 
voltage is 0.64 times VSS/TR or: 
≈
×
FB
SS/TR
V
0.64
V
             (7) 
The maximum VSS/TR that can be tracked is 1.25V. 
When the VSS/TR reaches near 1.2V, the SS/TR voltage 
will be internally clamped to 1/0.64 times of the 
reference voltage. And the output goes to the normal 
regulation. If the VSS/TR is reduced, the tracking will be 
started again, however, since the output does not sink 
current, VOUT may slowly follow VSS/TR, especially at 
light loads due to the output capacitor charges. The 
maximum voltage of SS/TR pin should never exceed its 
maximum rating of VIN + 0.3V. 
Note that if the VFB < 0.8V, the output voltage tolerance 
can be lower than the specified accuracy.

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
Typical Applications 
The SGM62180 is a two phase synchronous Buck 
converter with 6A output current capability, 4.5V to 16V 
input voltage range and 0.9V to 6V programmable 
output voltage range. This device needs minimum 
number of external components as shown in Figure 3. 
The external components are: output filter L and C, 
input capacitors, a small soft-start capacitor, output 
voltage programming resistor divider and an optional 
pull-up resistor for PG. The two-phase design allows 
using of two thin inductors rather than one large 
inductor and makes this device an excellent choice for 
low-profile applications.

Detailed Design Procedure 
Programming the Output Voltage 
The center point of a resistor divider between VOUT and 
AGND is connected to the FB pin to program the output 
voltage. The reference voltage is VREF = 0.8V and the 
VFB which is calculated by R2 × VOUT/(R1+R2) is normally 
regulated to be equal to VREF. The VOUT output can be 
set between 0.9V to 6V. The R1 and R2 can be selected 
based on Equation 8:

             (8) 
Larger resistors are preferred to improve light load 
efficiency, but using too large values reduces the noise 
immunity of the FB input. The bias currents may also 
affect the output accuracy. Set the divider current to 
5µA for a good compromise, Equation 9 can be used to 
calculate R2:

             (10) 
For VOUT = 3.3V, Equation 10 gives R1 = 500kΩ. The 
nearest standard resistor values are R1 = 470kΩ and R2 
= 150kΩ that result in VOUT = 3.307V which is accurate 
enough. For more accurate output voltage, 0.1% 
resistors can be used. 
If the FB pin is open or mistakenly programmed for 
large values, the internal clamp will limit the output 
voltage to about 7V. 
 
Input Capacitor Selection 
The input capacitor is needed for Buck converters to 
circulate the pulsating (AC) input current that is 
produced by the switching. Low ESR decoupling 
capacitors placed close to the VINx pins are critical for 
avoiding large voltage transients on the switches. They 
should have sufficient RMS current rating and be able 
to provide the peak currents. It is enough for most 
application with 2 × 22µF (22µF on VIN1 and another 
one on VIN2 input) capacitors. They must be placed 
between VINx and nearby PGND pins and as close as 
possible to the device. Additional bulk capacitance may 
be added if required for the application. The worst-case 
effective capacitance must always remain above 2 × 
2µF (close to IC) + 10µF (bulk) on VIN pins to assure 
proper operation of the device. Low ESR multilayer 
ceramic capacitors are recommended for better 
filtering. 
 
Output Filter Selection 
The SGM62180 is internally compensated and is 
optimized for a range of LC values as provided in Table 
3. The checked cells show the LC combinations that 
are proven for stability by lab tests and simulation. 
Other LC combinations must be tested if needed for 
specific applications. The given L and C values are 
nominal. The actual capacitance may have a +20% to 
-60% tolerance.

Choose X5R or better grade ceramic dielectric types for 
input and output capacitors. Consider at least 25% 
room for voltage ratings. The 10V capacitors can be 
chosen for output capacitors to get lower thickness if 
capacitance reducing since the DC bias effect is 
acceptable for the application.

APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued) 
Inductor Selection 
Two 1µH inductors are normally chosen for the 
SGM62180. The DCR, saturation current and inductor 
height are the main parameters to choose depending 
on the required load current, efficiency and height 
restrictions. The ripple, RMS and peak inductors 
current calculations are summarized in Equations 11, 
12 and 13 respectively.

The current flowing through the inductor is the inductor 
ripple current plus the output current. During power-up, 
faults or transient load conditions, the inductor current 
can increase above the calculated peak inductor 
current level calculated above. In transient conditions, 
the inductor current can increase up to the switch 
current limit of the device. For this reason, the most 
conservative approach is to specify an inductor with a 
saturation current rating equal to or greater than the 
switch current limit rather than the peak inductor 
current. 
For low profile applications, a tradeoff between the 
physical inductor size and its losses are necessary. 
Normally, a smaller solution size is less efficient due to 
the higher DCR and/or core losses of the smaller 
inductors. 
 
 
Output Capacitor Selection 
Proper output capacitor selection is critical for the 
SGM62180 stability. COUT also determines transient 
response behavior and the magnitude of output ripple. 
In Table 4, the recommended output capacitor 
arrangements are provided for a range of output 
transient deviations in response to a 2A-6A-2A load 
step using 1µH inductors. 
Low ESR ceramic capacitors with X5R or X7R 
(preferred) are recommended for the SGM62180 to get 
low output voltage ripple and temperature stable 
capacitance. Selecting higher output capacitance can 
provide tighter transient response and lower output 
voltage ripple. Larger COUT also improves the PSM 
output voltage accuracy. However, selecting a too large 
output capacitance may cause stability issues.

NOTES: 
1. Due to the DC bias effect, the effective capacitance of the 
ceramic capacitors can drop significantly when the operating 
capacitor voltage is near the rated voltage depending on the 
selected package size, voltage rating and dielectric material. 
2. Use a 10pF feedforward capacitor, parallel to R1, to 
improve stability and reduce output overshoots/undershoots 
caused by heavy load steps. 
3. The transient load step is tested with 1A/µs rising and 
falling slopes.

APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued) 
Soft-Start Capacitor Selection 
The soft-start time is set by a small external capacitor 
(CSS) connected to the SS/TR pin. An internal 5µA 
current source charges the CSS. The rising rate of the 
CSS voltage determines the soft-start time as given by 
Equation 14: 
=
×
SS
SS
5μA
C
t
1.25V              (14) 
Where tSS is the soft-start ramp time in milli-seconds. 
For example, if tSS = 750μs is needed, the calculated 
CSS will be 3nF and a standard 3.3nF capacitor can be 
used for CSS. A minimum 220pF capacitor must be used 
for CSS. 
Do not leave SS/TR pin open to avoid output transients. 
The SS/TR pin may also be used as voltage input for 
output tracking as explained in the Tracking section. 
 
Adjusting the UVLO Using Accurate EN Threshold 
The accurate EN threshold voltage of the SGM62180 
can be used to adjust the turn-on input voltage of the 
device using a resistive divider as shown in Figure 4.

10µA) in the divider at the nominal input voltage. For 
example, for an 8V input rail, choose REN1 + 
REN2||350kΩ = 800kΩ. If the desired turn-on level is 
5.5V, the standard resistor values, derived from 
Equation 15, are REN1 = 634kΩ and REN2 = 249kΩ. The 
device turns on when VIN rises above 5.5V and turns off 
when input drops below 5.0V (VL_EN = 0.93V, TYP).

LAYOUT CONSIDERATIONS 
Guidelines 
To get a high performance power supply with the 
SGM62180, the PCB layout must be designed carefully 
with low noise and thermal relief considerations. 
Improper layout may result in poor performance in 
output regulation, stability, output accuracy, noise 
sensitivity and radiated EMI. Because the SGM62180 
provides very high power density, the thermal design of 
the PCB for proper heat dissipation is critical for good 
thermal performance. 
 
Layout 
Figure 9 and Figure 10 show a recommended PCB 
layout for the SGM62180. This layout is designed 
based on the following important considerations to 
provide 
a 
very 
good 
electrical 
and 
thermal 
performance: 
(1) The input capacitors are placed as close as 
possible to the VINx and PGND pins to provide low 
resistive and inductive paths for the high di/dt input 
current. The input capacitance is split equally 
between VIN1 and VIN2 to avoid interference 
between the input lines. 
(2) The SW1 and SW2 connections from the device to 
the inductors are kept as short as possible with 
enough width to carry the output current. 
(3) The VOUT regulation loop (FB) is routed close to the 
COUT and its ground connection. If the returns are 
through a ground plane in another layer, direct via 
connections are recommended, otherwise use the 
shortest path for COUT GND connection to avoid 
poor load regulation. 
(4) The FB node is sensitive to high dv/dt interference 
signals. Place the resistor divider as close as 
possible to the FB pin and avoid long traces in the 
divider network.
