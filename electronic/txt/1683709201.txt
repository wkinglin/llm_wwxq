GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM4554 is a 1-bit, non-inverting, bidirectional 
voltage-level translator which features two independent 
configurable power-supply lines. The A and B ports 
track the VCCA supply and VCCB supply respectively. The 
supply voltage range is 1.2V to 5.0V for A port and 
1.65V to 5.5V for B port. The device provides a 
bidirectional translation function among the different 
voltage nodes (including 1.2V, 1.5V, 1.8V, 2.5V, 3.3V 
and 5V). 
The SGM4554 has an output enable (OE) function, 
which controls the outputs states. When OE goes low, 
all outputs enter into the high-impedance state. The OE 
should be connected to GND via a pull-down resistor, 
and the minimum resistor value is depended on the 
current source capability of the driver. 
The SGM4554 is available in Green UTDFN-1.45×1-6L 
and SC70-6 packages. It operates over an ambient 
temperature range of -40℃ to +85℃.

NOTES: 
1. When the input and output current ratings are observed, 
the input and I/O negative voltage ratings may be exceeded. 
2. VCCA and VCCB values are shown in the recommended 
operating conditions in Electrical Characteristics section. 
 
RECOMMENDED OPERATING CONDITIONS 
Operating Temperature Range 
....................... -40℃ to +85℃ 
 
OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged by ESD if you don’t 
pay attention to ESD protection. SGMICRO recommends that 
all integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because very small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet its published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
Applications 
For the application of the SGM4554, it is often used in the 
voltage-level translation system. 
 
Architecture 
The SGM4554 can switch the direction of the transmission for 
port A and port B automatically without any external control. 
The output drivers can keep high or low in a DC state, 
however, they are designed to be weak so that they can be 
overdriven by external drivers when the data on the bus starts 
flowing in the opposite direction. 
Figure 7 shows the architecture of an SGM4554 cell. The 
main explanation of the internal circuit for the SGM4554 is 
shown as below: 
 The one-shot circuitry can be used to detect the rising 
edges or the falling edges of the signal for port A and port 
B automatically. 
 When in the rising edge, two PMOSFETs (T1 and T3) are 
turned on by one-shot in a short time. The feature speeds 
up the transition from low to high.  
 When in the falling edge, two NMOSFETs (T2 and T4) are 
turned on by one-shot in a short time. The feature speeds 
up the transition from high to low. 
 The output impedance is 140Ω (TYP) when VCCO voltage 
range is from 1.2V to 1.8V, it is 50Ω (TYP) when VCCO 
voltage range is from 1.8V to 3.3V and 40Ω (TYP) when 
VCCO voltage range is from 3.3V to 5V.

Input Driver Requirements 
Figure 8 shows a typical VIN vs. IIN curve. To ensure proper 
operation, the SGM4554 data I/Os must be driven by a device 
with a drive strength of at least ±2mA. 
 
 
 
Figure 8. Typical VIN vs. IIN Curve 
 
Power-Up 
For the application of the SGM4554, the VCCA should be less 
than VCCB. However, it does not matter if the power supply 
voltage is ramping, and the sequence of power-up for both 
VCCA and VCCB is not defined. The SGM4554 has a circuitry 
that disables all output ports when either VCC is switched off 
(VCCA/VCCB = 0V). 
 
Enable and Disable 
The function of OE is used to disable SGM4554 by setting the 
transmitting I/O pins to high-impedance mode. The definition 
of disable time (tDIS) is the time period between OE goes low 
and when all of the I/O pins are in high-impedance mode. The 
enable time (tEN) is defined as the time period between OE 
goes to high position and one-shot part starts to operate. 
 
Pull-Up or Pull-Down Resistors on I/O Lines 
The SGM4554 features the drive capability that is designed to 
drive up to 70pF capacitive loads. The output drivers have the 
low DC drive strength. When the data I/Os are externally 
connected to the pull-up or pull-down resistors, the values 
must be greater than 50kΩ to ensure that they don’t conflict 
with the output driver. Therefore, the SGM4554 is not used in 
one-wire or I2C applications. For the bidirectional data I/Os, 
an open-drain driver is connected. For these applications, 
please use the open-drain output SGM4552 which is 
pin-compatible with the SGM4554.

1. VT = Input threshold voltage (typically VCCI/2).
2. VD = External driver supply voltage.
