GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM791A is a low current, single load sensing 
device that can detect connection or removal of the 
load on a supply bus. By using short pulse injections 
into the input capacitance and measuring the voltage 
change, load existence is periodically checked. 
The most recent detection status of the SNS pin can be 
reported on the FLG output. 
The device is available in a Green UTDFN-1×1-4L 
package. It operates in the ambient temperature range 
of -40℃ to +85℃.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
In many applications, detection of the load existence is 
necessary for system operation. For example, a power 
bank must detect the connection or removal of the 
loads to power up or power down the power circuits. 
The SGM791A provides a simple load detection 
solution for these applications by checking the load 
capacitance as indicator. The SNS pin acts as a pulse 
source with relatively large internal resistance. Short 
pulses of tTEST (35ns, TYP) time are periodically 
injected by the SNS pin to the power bus every tDET 
(160ms, TYP) period (5 ~ 7 times per second). 
The SNS pin couples to the bus by a capacitor. With 
ferrite beads used on the bus, the permanent 
capacitances of the power bus are isolated and the 
load capacitance can be detected directly by injecting 
signals. High-impedance ferrite beads block the pulses 
from injecting into the bus capacitors. The SNS pin 
sends the pulses periodically and checks the resulting 
voltage change. When a load capacitance is attached 
to the SNS pin, the pulse voltage will drop, and if the 
load is removed, the pulse voltage will rise. 
 
FLG Pin 
Right after each detection (tDET) period of the SGM791A, 
the status of the load connected to the SNS is updated 
on the FLG output. The FLG state remains unchanged 
until the next test. 
Table 1 summarizes how the FLG is updated depending 
on the load sense input.

Components Selection 
Referring to Figure 1 and Figure 3, a few external 
components are needed to complete the load detection 
circuit. It is important that the ferrite bead B1 should 
have enough current rating to carry the load current 
and high enough impedance at high frequency to 
isolate the test pulses from the permanent bus 
capacitors. FBSWB0402-102-201R is recommended. 
Coupling capacitor C1 can be chosen in a range from 
100nF to 1μF. 
If the load connection point is close to the sense pin, 
the SGM791A can easily detect connection or removal 
of the load with minimum 100nF input capacitance. If 
the load is away from the device, the load capacitance 
must be increased to ensure detection. 
 
Application Example 
Figure 1 shows how the SGM791A can be used in 
applications 
with 
no 
host 
to 
turn 
on 
or 
off 
(enable/disable) a power supply when a load is 
connected or disconnected. The power supply is 
enabled if a load is connected to the load port (SNS). 
Figure 3 shows how the SGM791A is used to detect 
whether it is connected or not with a power bus. The 
bus may be powered off.
