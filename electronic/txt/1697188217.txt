OCTOBER 2023 – REV. A. 1 
GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM8772 is a dual, high precision differential 
voltage comparator with a voltage reference and a 
NAND gate. The device optimized for high voltage 
operation from 2.8V to 36V single supply or ±1.4V to 
±18V dual power supplies. It consumes low supply 
current without being affected by the supply voltage. 
Input common mode voltage is 1.5V lower than +VS. 
The SGM8772 has a push-pull output structure without 
external pull-up resistors. This feature makes it a good 
choice for applications whose PCB sizes are limited. 
The SGM8772 also provides one window comparator 
output. 
The SGM8772 is available in a Green MSOP-10 
package. It is operated over the -40℃ to +125℃ 
temperature range.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
The SGM8772 is dual, high precision, low power 
comparator. The wide input voltage range and power 
supply range make the device a good choice for industrial 
equipment. Push-pull structure saves external pull-up 
resistors. The SGM8772 can be compatible with CMOS 
and TTL logics. 
 
Output Structure 
In Figure 1, the SGM8772 has a push-pull output stage. 
When output is changed from logic high/low to low/high, 
the changed sink/source current pulls/pushes output 
pin to logic low/high. Beginning this transition, larger 
sink/source current is used to create a high slew rate 
transit from high/low to low/high. Once the output 
voltage reaches VOL/VOH, it will reduce the sink/source 
current to a just right value to maintain the VOL/VOH 
static condition. This current-driven push-pull output 
stage will significantly reduce the power consumption in 
application system. OUTA, OUTB and NAND gate form 
the third window comparator output. 
If low slew rate transition is needed in system design, 
adjusting the load capacitance will change the slew rate. 
The heavier capacitive load will slow down the output 
voltage transition. This feature will be used to reduce 
the interference generated by fast edge of transition 
between 1 and 0 in noise-sensitive system.

Layout and Bypassing 
Good power supply decoupling, layout and grounding 
are very important for SGM8772 to realize the full 
high-speed capabilities in system, following skills will be 
used: 
 A 0.1µF to 4.7µF range ceramic capacitor is used to 
provide good power supply decoupling. This ceramic 
capacitor must be placed as close to +VS pin as 
possible. 
 For grounding, unbroken and low-inductance ground 
plane is a good choice. 
 For Layout, use short PCB trace to avoid unwanted 
parasitic feedback around the comparator. SGM8772 
must be soldered directly to the PCB and the socket is 
not recommended.
