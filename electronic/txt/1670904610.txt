GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM2358 is a dual, voltage feedback amplifier. 
The device can operate from 2.5V to 5.5V single supply. 
It provides rail-to-rail output voltage swing. This feature 
makes SGM2358 appropriate for buffering ASIC. 
The SGM2358 offers a gain-bandwidth product of 
1MHz and an ultra-low input bias current of 10pA. It is 
well suited for piezoelectric sensors, integrators and 
photodiode amplifiers. 
The SGM2358 is designed into a wide range of 
applications, such as battery-powered instrumentation, 
safety monitoring, portable systems, and transducer 
interface circuits in low power systems. 
The SGM2358 is available in a Green SOIC-8 package. 
It is specified over the extended -40 ℃ to +85 ℃ 
temperature range.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
Rail-to-Rail Output 
The SGM2358 supports rail-to-rail output operation. In 
single power supply application, for example, when +VS 
= 5V, -VS = GND, 10kΩ load resistor is tied from OUT 
pin to ground, the typical output swing range is from 
0.008V to 4.992V. 
 
Driving Capacitive Loads 
The SGM2358 is designed for unity-gain stable for 
capacitive load up to 250pF. If greater capacitive load 
must be driven in application, the circuit in Figure 1 can 
be used. In this circuit, the IR drop voltage generated 
by RISO is compensated by feedback loop. 
 
 
 
Figure 1. Circuit to Drive Heavy Capacitive Load 
 
Power Supply Decoupling and Layout 
A clean and low noise power supply is very important in 
amplifier circuit design, besides of input signal noise, 
the power supply is one of important source of noise to 
the amplifier through +VS and -VS pins. Power supply 
bypassing is an effective method to clear up the noise 
at power supply, and the low impedance path to ground 
of decoupling capacitor will bypass the noise to GND. 
In application, 10μF ceramic capacitor paralleled with 
0.1μF or 0.01μF ceramic capacitor is used in Figure 2. 
The ceramic capacitors should be placed as close as 
possible to +VS and -VS power supply pins.

Typical Application Circuits 
Difference Amplifier 
The circuit in Figure 3 is a design example of classical 
difference amplifier. If R4/R3 = R2/R1, then VOUT = (VP - 
VN) × R2/R1 + VREF. 
 
 
 
Figure 3. Difference Amplifier 
 
High Input Impedance Difference Amplifier 
The circuit in Figure 4 is a design example of high input 
impedance difference amplifier, the added amplifiers at 
the input are used to increase the input impedance and 
eliminate drawback of low input impedance in Figure 3. 
 
 
 
Figure 4. High Input Impedance Difference Amplifier 
 
Active Low-Pass Filter 
The circuit in Figure 5 is a design example of active 
low-pass filter, the DC gain is equal to -R2/R1 and the 
-3dB corner frequency is equal to 1/2πR2C. In this 
design, the filter bandwidth must be less than the 
bandwidth of the amplifier, the resistor values must be 
selected as low as possible to reduce ringing or 
oscillation generated by the parasitic parameters in 
PCB layout.
