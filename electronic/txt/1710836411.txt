GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM620A is a high accuracy, high voltage 
instrumentation amplifier, which is designed to set any 
gain from 1 to 10000 with one external resistor. The 
device works well in battery-powered applications due 
to the low power consumption of 1.3mA typical 
quiescent current. The SGM620A provides SOIC-8 and 
TDFN-3×3-8L packages which are much smaller than 
discrete classical-three-OPAs circuits. 
The SGM620A provides 120ppm (MAX) non-linearity 
and 80μV (MAX) low input offset voltage. The device 
also features low noise, low bias current and low power. 
The combination of these characteristics makes it a 
good choice for applications requiring excellent DC 
performance. 
The SGM620A offers 6nV/√Hz low input voltage noise, 
300fA/√Hz input current noise at 1kHz, and 0.4μVP-P in 
the 0.1Hz to 10Hz band. It is suitable for pre-amplifier 
applications. The 10μs settling time to 0.01% makes 
SGM620A appropriate for multiplexed applications. 
The SGM620A is available in Green SOIC-8 and 
TDFN-3×3-8L packages. It is specified over the 
extended -40℃ to +125℃ temperature range.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

Figure 1. Simplified Schematic 
 
The high precision input is provided by the two input 
transistor Q1 and Q2 (Figure 1) and this results in 10 × 
lower bias current of the input pins. The constant 
collector current of Q1 and Q2 is maintained by the two 
loops Q1-A1-R1 and Q2-A2-R2, so the input voltage is 
impressed across the gain setting resistor RG of the 
amplifier. The differential gain from A1/A2 outputs can 
be expressed by G = 1+ (R1+R2)/RG. The unity-gain 
subtractor (A3) can reject the common mode signal so 
that SGM620A produces a single-ended output with 
REF pin biased. 
The transconductance of the pre-amplifier is determined 
by the resistance of RG. The transconductance will 
increase gradually to that of the input transistors if the 
resistance of RG is reduced for larger gains. The 
important benefits are shown below: 
 Boosting the open-loop gain can also increase the 
programmed gain, so that the related error of gain is 
reduced. 
 The gain-bandwidth product which is determined by 
the two capacitors C1, C2 and the transconductance of 
the pre-amplifier can increase with programmed gain, 
so that the frequency response is enhanced. 
 Reducing the input voltage noise to 6nV/√Hz, and it is 
determined by the base resistance and the collector 
current of the input. 
The integrated resistors (R1 and R2) inside the 
SGM620A are set to 24.7kΩ, so that the gain can be 
programmed with the external resistor RG. 
The equation of gain is shown as below:

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
Pressure Measurement 
SGM620A is widely used in the application of bridge, such as measuring the pressure in weigh scales. It is also 
suitable for detecting the pressure sensor with higher resistance due to high input impedance. 
Figure 2 shows the pressure transducer bridge of 5kΩ which is powered by a 5V single supply. In such a circuit, the 
bridge consumes only 1mA. The buffered voltage divider and SGM620A can condition the output signal with typical 
3.3mA supply current. 
The advantage of small size for SGM620A is attractive for the transducers of pressure. Because of the low noise 
and drift, it can also be used in the application of diagnostic non-invasive blood pressure measurement.

Because of the advantage of low current noise, SGM620A can be used in ECG monitors (Figure 3) where the source 
resistances can reach 1MΩ or higher. It is the best choice to use SGM620A in the battery-powered data recorders as 
it can operate on the condition of low supply voltage, low power and space-saving packages. 
Moreover, for better performance, combining with the advantages of low voltage noise, low current and low bias 
currents can enhance the dynamic range of SGM620A. 
The stability of the right leg drive loop can be maintained by the capacitor C1. Moreover, for protecting the patient 
from the possible harm, the isolation safeguards should be added between the patient and the circuit part.

Precision V-I Converter 
It’s easy to realize a precision current source (Figure 4) 
utilizing one SGM620A, another operational amplifier 
and two resistors. To obtain a better CMRR of 
SGM620A, a buffer should be placed between the REF 
pin and the OUT pin of the amplifier. The equation 
which is shown in Figure 4 illustrates the output current 
of the circuit.

Input and Output Offset Voltage 
Two main sources which are error of input and output 
result in the low errors of SGM620A. When referred to 
the input, the output error should be divided by the gain 
of the instrumentation amplifier. From the equations 
which are shown as below, the input error takes a 
leading position at large gains while the output error 
takes a leading position at small gains. 
Total Error Referred to Input (RTI) = Input Error + 
(Output Error/G) 
Total Error Referred to Output (RTO) = (Input Error × G) 
+ Output Error 
 
Terminal of Reference 
Potential of the reference terminal defines the zero 
output voltage. It becomes extremely useful while the 
load is not tied to the precise ground of the rest of the 
system. The reference terminal provides one way to 
bias a precise voltage to the output, and the reference 
voltage should be in the range of 2V within the supply 
voltages. On top of these, to keep better CMRR, the 
parasitic resistor at this pin should be low.  
 
Selection of Gain  
The gain of the instrumentation amplifier is determined 
by the external resistor RG. The accuracy of the 
external resistor RG is important as it may influence the 
error of gain. It is recommended that selecting the 
resistor with 0.1% or 1% precision is a good choice. 
The following table shows the gain effect with the 
selection of 1% or 0.1% precision resistor. Also, leaving 
the pin 1 and pin 8 (the place of RG) open can make the 
gain of SGM620A equals to 1. 
G
49.4kΩ
R  = G - 1  
As mentioned before, the gain error can be minimized 
by equivalent parasitic resistor in series with RG. 
Moreover, low TC of 1ppm/ ℃ is required for the 
selection of RG to avoid the gain drift of SGM620A.

APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued) 
RF Interference 
One of the characteristics of instrumentation amplifier is 
rectifying the small signal which is out of the band. This 
kind of disturbance can be described as the small 
biased voltage. All of the high frequency components 
can be filtered by the R-C network which is placed in 
the input position of the instrumentation amplifier, as 
shown in Figure 6. The following equation shows the 
equation of filtering frequency for the differential and 
common mode part of the input signal.

CD ≥ 10CC is required in the above equation. 
The capacitor CD influences the quality of the differential 
signal, while CC influences the quality of the common 
mode signal. The common mode rejection ratio would 
be reduced if the R × CC is mismatched. To reduce this 
negative influence and obtain a good CMRR, it is 
recommended that the capacitance of CD should be 10 
times larger than CC. To conclude, the larger the ratio of 
CD:CC is, the less negative influence to the circuit.

Figure 6. One Method to Reduce the Interference of RF  
Common Mode Rejection 
The common mode rejection ratio of the instrumentation 
amplifier is high as it can measure the differential signal 
between the two inputs when both IN+ and IN- increase 
or decrease equally. Also, this specification can be 
defined in the whole range of input voltage. 
To obtain a best CMRR, it is recommended that the 
REF pin should be connected to a low impedance input 
and the difference of impedance between two inputs 
should be as small as possible. Also, using shielded 
cable can effectively reduce the noise of the circuit, and 
it should be driven properly for better value of CMRR. 
The following two figures (Figure 7 and Figure 8) 
illustrate the method to increase the CMRR for 
alternating circuit by bootstrapping the capacitance of 
the shielded cable, and this kind of method can also 
reduce the mismatching of capacitance at the inputs.

APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued) 
Isolation of Grounding 
For solving the problems of grounding, REF pin should 
be connected to the "local ground" as the output of the 
instrumentation amplifier is biased with VREF. 
Because of the noisy environment of the digital circuit, 
the component of data-acquisition such as Analog 
Digital Converter (ADC) has two pins which are AGND 
and DGND. Also, the isolation can be made by using a 
single line or 0Ω resistor. However, each returns of 
ground should be separated so that the current flow 
from the sensitive point could be minimized. Also, the 
ground returns between analog and digital should be 
tied together with one point, which is shown in ADC part 
of Figure 9.

Return of Grounding for IB 
The bias current (IB) at the inputs is needed for 
operating and biasing the transistor at the input stage of 
the instrumentation amplifier, so it is also necessary to 
design a ground return path for the bias current. For 
example, for operating the floating inputs of the 
amplifier (see Figure 10 ~ 12), such as AC-coupled 
transformer, there should be an electrical line between 
the input and the ground for ground return of bias 
current.
