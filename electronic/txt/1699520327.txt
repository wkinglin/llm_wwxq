GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The 74AHCT595 is an 8-bit serial-in/serial-out or 
parallel-out shift register with output latches designed 
for 4.5V to 5.5V VCC operation. 
The device integrates an 8-bit shift register and an 8-bit 
D-type storage register. The storage register features 
parallel 3-state outputs. The shift register provides a 
clear input (SRCLR
തതതതതതതതതത) with direct overriding function, 
serial input (SER) and serial outputs to implement 
cascading. When output enable input (OE
ത
ത
ത
ത
ത) is held low, 
the data in storage register will appear at the output. 
When OE 
തതതതതis held high, all outputs are in high-impedance 
state. 
Both the shift register and storage register have separate 
clocks. The shift register clock (SRCLK) and storage 
register clock (RCLK) are positive-edge triggered.  
 
FEATURES 
● Supply Voltage Range: 4.5V to 5.5V 
● +8mA/-8mA Output Current 
● Direct Clear Input of Shift Register 
● Inputs are Compatible with TTL-Voltage  
● Latch-up Performance (> 100mA) Meets JESD 78, 
Class II Standard 
● -40℃ to +125℃ Operating Temperature Range 
● Available in Green TSSOP-16 and SOIC-16

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
1. Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may 
affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
2. The input and output negative voltage ratings may be 
exceeded if the input and output clamp current ratings are 
observed. 
3. The performance capability of a high-performance integrated 
circuit in conjunction with its thermal environment can create 
junction temperatures which are detrimental to reliability. 
4. Unused input pins must be held at VCC or GND to guarantee 
the device in normal operation. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.

NOTES: 
1. Specified by design and characterization, not production tested. 
2. The set-up time enables the storage register to get stable data from the shift register. In this case where clocks can be tied 
together, the shift register is a clock pulse in front of the storage register. 
3. tREC is the same as SRCLR
തതതതതതതതതത high (inactive) before SRCLK ↑. 
4. CPD is used to determine the dynamic power dissipation (PD in μW). 
PD = CPD × VCC
2 × fi + Σ(CL × VCC
2 × fo) 
where: 
fi = Input frequency in MHz. 
fo = Output frequency in MHz. 
CL = Output load capacitance in pF. 
VCC = Supply voltage in Volts. 
Σ(CL × VCC
2 × fo) = Sum of outputs. 
5. All 9 outputs switching.
