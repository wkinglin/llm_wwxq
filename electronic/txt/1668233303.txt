OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

to adjust the output voltage. Place the resistors as close as possible to this pin. 
3 
GND 
Ground. 
4 
PGOOD 
Power-Good Indicator Output Pin. An open-drain, active-high output that indicates the status 
of VOUT. When the output voltage reaches 89% of the target, the PG pin goes into a 
high-impedance state. 
5 
NC 
No Internal Connection. Connect this pin to ground or leave it floating. 
6 
NR/SS 
Noise-Reduction and Soft-Start Pin. Connecting an external capacitor CNR/SS between this 
pin and GND can reduce the output noise and slow down the VOUT rise to achieve soft 
starting. 
7 
EN 
Enable Control Input Pin. Drive EN high to turn on the regulator. Drive EN low to turn off the 
regulator. 
8 
VIN 
Input Voltage Supply Pin. It is recommended to use a 10μF or larger ceramic capacitor from 
VIN pin to ground to get good power supply decoupling. This ceramic capacitor should be 
placed as close as possible to VIN pin.

Ultra-Low Dropout Linear Regulator

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
The SGM2056 is a high current, high PSRR, ultra-low 
noise and ultra-low dropout voltage linear regulator and 
provides 1.2A output current. These features make the 
device a reliable solution to solve many challenging 
problems in the generation of clean and accurate 
power supply. The high performance also makes the 
SGM2056 useful in a variety of applications. The 
SGM2056 provides the protection functions for output 
overload, output short-circuit condition and overheating. 
The SGM2056 provides an EN pin as an external chip 
enable control to enable/disable the device. When the 
regulator is in shutdown state, the shutdown current 
consumes as low as 1μA (TYP). 
 
Input Capacitor Selection (CIN) 
The input decoupling capacitor should be placed as 
close as possible to the VIN pin to ensure the device 
stability. A 10μF or larger X7R or X5R ceramic 
capacitor is selected to get good dynamic performance. 
When VIN is required to provide large current 
instantaneously, a large effective input capacitor is 
required. Multiple input capacitors can limit the input 
tracking inductance. Adding more input capacitors is 
available to restrict the ringing and to keep it below the 
device absolute maximum ratings. 
 
Output Capacitor Selection (COUT) 
The output capacitor should be placed as close as 
possible to the VOUT pin. A 10μF or larger X7R or X5R 
ceramic capacitor is selected to get good dynamic 
performance. The minimum effective capacitance of 
COUT that SGM2056 can remain stable is 9μF. For 
ceramic capacitor, temperature, DC bias and package 
size will change the effective capacitance, so enough 
margin of COUT must be considered in design. 
Additionally, COUT with larger capacitance and lower 
ESR will help increase the high frequency PSRR and 
improve the load transient response. 
 
Noise-Reduction and Soft-Start Capacitor 
Selection (CNR/SS) 
The SGM2056 provides a programmable soft-start 
output function. It is generally recommended to connect 
an external capacitor (CNR/SS) between the NR/SS pin 
and GND. It can not only slow down the VOUT rise so as 
to achieve soft starting, but also reduce the output 
noise effectively. 
 
Dropout Voltage 
The SGM2056 features low dropout voltage due to low 
RDS(ON) NMOSFET power transistor. For Linear 
regulator, when (VIN - VOUT) < dropout voltage (VDROP), 
the NMOSFET power transistor will be turned on like a 
switch and the parameter of linear regulator, such as 
PSRR, load and input transient responses, will be 
degraded so much. To get good performance in 
application, the VIN must be larger than (VOUT + VDROP). 
 
Adjustable Regulator 
The output voltage of the SGM2056 can be adjusted 
from 0.8V to 5.5V. The FB pin will be connected to two 
external resistors as shown in Figure 3. The output 
voltage is determined by the following equation:

Figure 3. Adjustable Output Voltage Application 
 
One parallel capacitor (CFF) with R1 can be used to 
improve the feedback loop stability and PSRR, 
increase the transient response and reduce the output 
noise. Use R2 = 80kΩ to maintain a 10μA minimum 
load.

APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued) 
Enable Operation 
The EN pin of the SGM2056 is used to enable/disable 
its device and to deactivate/activate the output 
automatic discharge function. 
When the EN pin voltage is lower than 0.5V, the device 
is in shutdown state. There is no current flowing from 
VIN to VOUT pins. In this state, the automatic discharge 
transistor is active to discharge the output voltage 
through a 90Ω (TYP) resistor. 
When the EN pin voltage is higher than 1V, the device 
is in active state. The output voltage is regulated to the 
expected value and the automatic discharge transistor 
is turned off. 
 
Under-Voltage Lockout (UVLO) 
To protect the device from malfunctioning when the 
input voltage is insufficient, under-voltage lockout 
(UVLO) protection is included. The device will not 
operate until the input voltage exceeds UVLO rising 
threshold, and will lockout if the input voltage falls 
below the UVLO falling threshold. The local input 
capacitance prevents severe brownouts in most 
applications. 
 
Reverse Current Protection 
The pass transistor has an inherent body diode which 
will be forward biased in the case when VOUT > (VIN + 
0.3V). If extended reverse voltage operation is 
anticipated, external limiting might be appropriate.

Output Current Limit 
When overload events happen, the output current is 
internally limited to 2.3A (TYP). 
 
Thermal Shutdown 
The SGM2056 can detect the temperature of die. When 
the die temperature exceeds the threshold value of 
thermal shutdown, the SGM2056 will be in shutdown 
state and it will remain in this state until the die 
temperature decreases to +130℃. 
 
Power Dissipation (PD) 
Power dissipation (PD) of the SGM2056 can be 
calculated by the equation PD = (VIN - VOUT) × IOUT. 
Thermal shutdown protection starts when the power 
dissipation of the device is too high and the operating 
junction temperature exceeds +150℃. 
The maximum allowable power dissipation (PD(MAX)) of 
the SGM2056 is affected by many factors, including the 
difference between junction temperature and ambient 
temperature (TJ(MAX) - TA), package thermal resistance 
from the junction to the ambient environment (θJA), the 
rate of ambient airflow and PCB layout. PD(MAX) can be 
approximated by the following equation:  
PD(MAX) = (TJ(MAX) - TA)/θJA               (2) 
 
Layout Guidelines 
To get good PSRR, low output noise and high transient 
response performance, the input and output bypass 
capacitors must be placed as close as possible to the 
VIN pin and VOUT pin separately. It is recommended to 
use separate ground planes for VIN/VBIAS and VOUT and 
these ground planes are single point connected to the 
GND pin.
