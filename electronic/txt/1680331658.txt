MARCH 2023 – REV.A.1 
GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM13001A is a low noise amplifier (LNA) for 
GLONASS, Galileo, Beidou and GPS applications. The 
device delivers 18.2dB gain at an extremely low noise 
figure of 0.9dB. It also features high gain and excellent 
linearity performance that operates from 1160MHz to 
1300MHz and 1550MHz to 1615MHz.  
The device requires 6.5mA from a single 1.6V to 3.6V 
supply, dropping to below 2.2μA in power down mode. 
No external DC blocking capacitors are required on the 
RF paths as long as no external DC voltage is applied, 
which can save PCB area and cost. 
The SGM13001A is available in a Green UTDFN- 
1.1×0.7-6L package.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure 
to 
observe 
proper 
handling 
and 
installation 
procedures can cause damage. ESD damage can range from 
subtle performance degradation to complete device failure. 
Precision integrated circuits may be more susceptible to 
damage because even small parametric changes could 
cause the device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.
