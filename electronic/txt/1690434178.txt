MAY 2019 – REV. A 
GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM4510 is a low cost, CMOS monolithic, quad 
single-pole/single-throw (SPST) analog switch. It 
operates from +4.5V to +40V single power supply or 
±4.5V to ±20V dual power supplies. 
The SGM4510 is designed with improved charge 
injection compensation to minimize switching transients. 
Also, it has an improved continuous current rating of 
30mA. In ON conditions, the SGM4510 can provide 
true bidirectional performance. In OFF condition, the 
SGM4510 can block the signal to the supply level. 
These high performances make it very suitable for 
general purpose switching applications for industrial 
automation 
instrument 
communication 
systems, 
portable equipment and etc. 
The SGM4510 is available in a Green SOIC-16 
package. It is specified over the -40℃ to +85℃ 
temperature range. 
 
FEATURES 
● Single Supply Voltage Range: +4.5V to +40V 
● Dual-Supply Voltage Range: ±4.5V to ±20V 
● 1.8V Control Logic 
● Low On-Resistance: 15.5Ω (TYP) 
● Fast Switching Times: 
tON = 120ns 
tOFF = 40ns 
● Low Charge Injection: 55pC 
● Simple Logic Interface 
● Minimum Transients 
● -40℃ to +85℃ Operating Temperature Range 
● Available in a Green SOIC-16 Package

exceed VCC or VEE. Limit the current through the forward 
diode to the maximum ratings. 
 
RECOMMENDED OPERATING CONDITIONS 
Operating Temperature Range ....................... 
-40℃ to +85℃ 
OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.
