GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM3785 is a highly integrated boost DC/DC 
converter with 2MHz fixed frequency. High switching 
frequency makes it easy to use tiny components and 
optimized for portable photo flash. The SGM3785 is 
ideal for high power flash LEDs which are suited for 
mobile phone camera modules and digital still cameras. 
The SGM3785 offers excellent flexibility to enter flash 
mode and movie/torch mode through the ENF and 
ENM pins respectively. Flash mode is usually used with 
660ms timer control to generate a high intensity flash. 
The maximal flash current and movie/torch current are 
respectively programmed through external resistors 
(RSETF and RSETM), which can provide simple control for 
the flash LED solution. The real LED current in flash 
mode and movie/torch mode can be programmed by 
external PWM signal on ENM pin. 
The D1 and D2 pins can be tied together to drive higher 
power single flash LEDs, sinking up to 1.5A continuous 
current. The integrated thermal regulation in flash mode 
limits the temperature of the device. It can prevent the 
device from triggering thermal shutdown and provide 
the maximum LED output current continuously. 
The SGM3785 provides very low shutdown current. It 
also includes a comprehensive set of protection 
features such as over-voltage protection, LED open or 
short protection and thermal shutdown. 
The SGM3785 is available in a Green TDFN-3×2-14L 
package. It operates over an ambient temperature 
range of -40℃ to +85℃.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.

ENF 
Flash Mode Enable Pin. It has an internal 330kΩ pull-down resistor to AGND. Regardless of ENM, 
only when ENF = “High”, flash mode is in active and the flash current is equal to ISETF × D. D is the duty 
cycle of PWM signal on ENM pin. The frequency of PWM exceeds 15kHz. 
11 
ENM 
Movie/Torch Mode Enable Pin and Flash Mode PWM Dimming Pin. This pin has an internal 330kΩ 
pull-down resistor to AGND. In flash mode, the PWM signal at ENM pin is the flash current dimming 
control. When ENF = “Low” and the time of ENM = “High” is not less than 5ms, Movie/Torch mode is in 
active. The LED current should be equal to ISETM × D. D is the duty cycle of PWM signal at ENM pin. This 
PWM signal is sent to ENM pin after the first pulse, high level time of which is more than 5ms. When ENF 
= “Low” and the time of ENM = “Low” is not less than 5ms, the chip enters shutdown mode.
