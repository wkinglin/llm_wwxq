GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM40666AS and SGM40666BS are over-voltage 
protection devices designed to protect low voltage 
systems from damage with a high voltage supply up to 
+31VDC and +40VPEAK (10s with 50mA current limit). 
The SGM40666AS withstands +90V/-400V while 
SGM40666BS can also withstand surges up to +80V/ 
-400V without damage. 
The integrated 27mΩ (TYP) RON FET allows it to pass 
through 4.5A continuous current. The FET is turned off 
when the input voltage exceeds the over-voltage 
threshold, which can be adjusted between 4V and 22V 
with the optional external resistors. 
When the OVLO input is set below the external OVLO 
select threshold (0.26V TYP), the SGM40666AS and 
SGM40666BS automatically choose the internal trip 
thresholds that are preset to 6.79V typically. SGMICRO 
provides customized OVP threshold options for 
22.2V/15.3V/10.5V/6.35V/5.95V. Please contact us if 
necessary. 
The open-drain output (nACOK) indicates a stable 
power supply between minimum VIN and VOVLO. 
The SGM40666AS and SGM40666BS are available in 
a Green WLCSP-1.65×1.24-12B package.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied.

NOTES: 
1. Non-frequent repeated peak voltage during the input surge 
transient and ESD transient is not subject to this rating value, 
which may be higher than 40V in the surge test. 
2. Continuous current limit may vary with the circuit board 
thermal dissipation condition. 
3. If protection discharging is triggered, the discharging 
keeps until the supply falls below the hysteresis range. 
Continuously force driving during discharging with a voltage 
in the hysteresis range can cause overstress and even 
damage the device. Supply voltage within the hysteresis 
range is not recommended. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
The SGM40666AS and SGM40666BS are designed to 
protect low voltage systems from damage with a high voltage 
supply up to +31VDC and +40VPEAK (10s with 50mA current 
limit). The SGM40666AS withstands +90V/-400V while 
SGM40666BS can also withstand surges up to +80V/-400V 
without damage. Surge up tests are performed according to 
the test circuit in Figure 4. If the input voltage exceeds the 
over-voltage threshold, the internal 27mΩ (TYP) low RON FET 
is turned off to prevent damage to the protected components. 
A built-in 16.5ms (TYP) debounce time prevents turning the 
internal FET on falsely during start-up. 
 
Device Operation 
The SGM40666AS and SGM40666BS have a timing logic 
controlled charge pump, which is used as gate driver of the 
internal FET. If the internal trip threshold is used, the charge 
pump is enabled when VIN < VIN_OVLO, while if external trip 
threshold is used, it is enabled when VOVLO < VOVLO_EXT. 
The charge pump turns the internal FET on after a 16.5ms 
(TYP) debounce delay (see Figure 3), then soft-start function 
limits the FET inrush current for another 16.5ms (TYP). Once 
VIN rises above VOVLO_THRESH, the FET is turned off. 
 
Enable Function 
The IC has an enable pin that is used to enable or disable the 
device. Pull nEN high to turn off the internal pass FET, while 
pull it low to turn on the FET, the IC enters the start-up 
routine. 
 
Over-Voltage Lockout (OVLO) 
The typical over-voltage lockout (OVLO) thresholds of the 
SGM40666AS and SGM40666BS are 6.79V. 
If the input voltage exceeds the OVP rising trip level, the 
switch will be turned off in about 50ns. The switch will remain 
off until VIN falls below the OVP falling trip level. 
 
External Adjustable OVLO 
The devices detect the voltage on the OVLO pin to check if an 
external divider exists.  
If the OVLO pin is connected to GND, the OVLO value set 
internally will be applied. 
When an external resistor divider network is connected to the 
OVLO pin and VOVLO > VOVLO_SELECT (0.26V TYP), then this 
external resistor divider determines the VIN_OVLO_EXT. At 
present, VIN_OVLO_EXT, VBG, and R1 are known, R2 can be given 
by Equation 1:

R
 
(1) 
This 
external 
resistor divider 
network 
is 
completely 
independent of the internal resistor divider network. 
Note that OVLO pin must not be floating. 
 
Surge Protection 
The SGM40666AS integrates a clamping circuit to suppress 
the input surge voltage. When VIN voltage rises sharply 
(typically > 4.5V/μs) above 32.3V, the internal clamping circuit 
will be triggered to discharge the surge energy to the ground. 
The SGM40666BS discharges the surge energy to the 
ground when surge voltage rises above 45V. 
 
Thermal Shutdown Protection 
The SGM40666AS and SGM40666BS have the thermal 
shutdown protection. If the junction temperature exceeds 
+150℃ (TYP), the internal FET turns off. And the devices 
exit thermal shutdown if the junction temperature cools down 
by 20℃ (TYP). 
 
nACOK Output 
The device has an open-drain nACOK output that indicates a 
stable power source to the host. When the input voltage is 
stable between minimum VIN and VOVLO after debounce delay, 
nACOK goes to low. A pull-up resistor is set from nACOK to 
the host system logic I/O voltage. nACOK is high impedance 
if thermal shutdown occurs. 
 
USB OTG Support 
When used in an OTG application, the SGM40666AS and 
SGM40666BS can provide power from OUT to IN. Initially, the 
OTG voltage applied at OUT will forward bias the power 
switch bulk diode and present a voltage drop of approximately 
0.7V between OUT and IN. Once the voltage at IN exceeds 
the minimum input voltage of 2.5V and after debounce time, 
the main power switch will turn fully on, reducing the voltage 
drop from OUT to IN significantly.

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
IN Bypass Capacitor 
Place a 0.1μF ceramic bypass capacitor between IN and 
GND pins as close as possible to the device for most 
applications. When the power source has significant 
inductance because of long lead length, the device clamps 
the overshoot because of LC tank circuit. 
 
Output Capacitor 
The soft-start function is provided by the slow turn-on time, 
which allows the SGM40666AS and SGM40666BS to charge 
an output capacitor (up to 1000μF typically) without shutting 
down because of over-current condition.
