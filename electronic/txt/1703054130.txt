 
SGM821 
Nano-Power System Timer 
with Watchdog Function

DECEMBER2023–REV.A.1  
GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM821 is an ultra-low power and programmable 
watchdog timer designed for system wake-up in 
duty-cycled and battery-powered applications. 
The SGM821 with programmable interrupt timer 
consumes only 35nA (TYP) system current. Accordingly, 
the system can be placed in sleeping mode, consuming 
less power, and only returning to active mode when the 
device is interrupted. The SGM821 is ideal for wireless 
sensor applications or other applications with smaller 
batteries compared to the μC that typically costs 
micro-amps of total system current. The watchdog 
timer of the SGM821 can be programmed by an 
external resistor of 500Ω to 180kΩ. And it provides a 
corresponding time interval from 100ms to 8200s (TYP). 
The SGM821 is available in Green SOT-23-6 and 
TDFN-2×2-6AL packages. It operates over a junction 
temperature range of -40℃ to +105℃. 
FEATURES 
● Supply Voltage Range: 1.8V to 5.5V 
● Low Current Consumption: 35nA (TYP) 
● Programmable Watchdog Time: 
100ms to 8200s (TYP) 
● Manual Reset Input 
● Available in Green SOT-23-6 and TDFN-2×2-6AL

NOTE: 
1. The voltage between any two pins is not allowed to be 
greater than 6V. 
OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged by ESD if you don’t 
pay attention to ESD protection. SGMICRO recommends that 
all integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because very small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet its published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.

One-Time External Resistance Detection and Manual Reset Pin. Resistor 
connected between this pin and GND is used to set the watchdog timer. The 
allowable external resistance ranges from 500Ω to180kΩ. This pin is also 
used as an input manual reset pin, and pulling this pin up to VDD will issue 
an RSTn signal.
