OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
The SGM2201 is a high input voltage and low dropout 
LDO and provides 150mA output current. These 
features make the device a reliable solution to solve 
many challenging problems in the generation of clean 
and accurate power supply. The high performance also 
makes the SGM2201 useful in a variety of applications. 
The SGM2201 provides an EN pin as an external chip 
enable control to enable/disable the device. When the 
regulator is in shutdown state, the shutdown current 
consumes as low as 0.02μA (TYP). 
 
Input Capacitor Selection (CIN) 
The input decoupling capacitor should be placed as 
close as possible to the IN pin for ensuring the device 
stability. A 1μF to 10μF X7R or X5R ceramic capacitor 
is selected to get good dynamic performance. 
When VIN is required to provide large current 
instantaneously, a large effective input capacitor is 
required. Multiple input capacitors can limit the input 
tracking inductance. Adding more input capacitors is 
available to restrict the ringing and to keep it below the 
device absolute maximum ratings. 
 
Output Capacitor Selection (COUT) 
The output decoupling capacitor should be placed as 
close as possible to the OUT pin. A 1μF to 10μF X7R or 
X5R ceramic capacitor is selected to get good dynamic 
performance. For ceramic capacitor, temperature, DC 
bias and package size will change the effective 
capacitance, so enough margin of COUT must be 
considered in design. Additionally, COUT with larger 
capacitance and lower ESR will help increase the high 
frequency PSRR and improve the load transient 
response. 
 
Enable Operation 
The EN pin of the SGM2201 is used to enable/disable 
the device and to deactivate/activate the output 
automatic discharge function. 
When the EN pin voltage is lower than 0.4V, the device 
is in shutdown state. There is no current flowing from 
VIN to VOUT pins. In this state, the automatic discharge 
transistor is active to discharge the output voltage 
through a 75Ω (TYP) resistor. 
When the EN pin voltage is higher than 1.2V, the device 
is in active state. The output voltage is regulated to 
expected value and the automatic discharge transistor 
is turned off. 
 
Adjustable Regulator 
The output voltage of the SGM2201 can be adjusted 
from 0.8V to 13.2V. The FB pin will be connected to two 
external resistors as shown in Figure 2. The output 
voltage is determined by the following equation: 


=
×



1
FB
OUT
2
R
V
V
1+R
             (1) 
where: 
VOUT is output voltage and VFB is the internal voltage 
reference, VFB = 0.8V. 
One parallel capacitor (C1) with R1 can be used to 
improve the feedback loop stability and PSRR, 
increase the transient response and reduce the output 
noise. Use R2 = 2MΩ to maintain a 0.4μA minimum 
load. 
 
 
Figure 2. Adjustable Output Voltage Application 
 
Thermal Shutdown 
The SGM2201 can detect the temperature of die. When 
the die temperature exceeds the threshold value of 
thermal shutdown, the SGM2201 will be in shutdown 
state and it will remain in this state until the die 
temperature decreases to +130℃.
