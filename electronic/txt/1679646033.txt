MARCH 2023 – REV. A. 2
GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGMOP07D is a single, low noise and low offset 
voltage operational amplifier. It is optimized for high 
voltage operation from 3.6V to 36V single supply or 
±1.8V to ±18V dual supplies, while consuming only 
0.9mA quiescent current. 
The SGMOP07D is well suited in low noise systems. It 
exhibits a high gain-bandwidth product of 3MHz and a 
slew rate of 4V/μs. The output swing is rail-to-rail with 
heavy loads. These specifications make the operational 
amplifier appropriate for various applications. 
The SGMOP07D is available in a Green SOIC-8 
package. It is specified over the extended -40℃ to 
+125℃ temperature range. 
 
FEATURES 
• Low Noise: 8.5nV/√Hz at 1kHz 
• Low Bias Current: ±1nA (TYP) 
• High Open-Loop Gain: 120dB at VS = ±15V 
• High PSRR: 146dB 
• High Gain-Bandwidth Product: 3MHz 
• Settling Time to 0.1% with 1V Step: 0.5μs 
• Overload Recovery Time: 10μs 
• Rail-to-Rail Output 
• Support Single or Dual Power Supplies: 
3.6V to 36V or ±1.8V to ±18V 
• Input Common Mode Voltage Range: 
(-VS) + 1.5V to (+VS) - 2V 
• Low Quiescent Current: 0.9mA (TYP) 
• -40℃ to +125℃ Operating Temperature Range 
• Available in a Green SOIC-8 Package

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

APPLICATION INFORMATION
Power Supply Decoupling and Layout 
A clean and low noise power supply is very important in 
amplifier circuit design, besides of input signal noise, 
the power supply is one of important source of noise to 
the amplifier through +VS and -VS pins. Power supply 
bypassing is an effective method to clear up the noise 
at power supply, and the low impedance path to ground 
of decoupling capacitor will bypass the noise to GND. 
In application, 10μF ceramic capacitor paralleled with 
0.1μF or 0.01μF ceramic capacitor is used in Figure 1. 
The ceramic capacitors should be placed as close as 
possible to +VS and -VS power supply pins.  
 
Figure 1. Amplifier Power Supply Bypassing 
 
Grounding 
In low speed application, one node grounding technique 
is the simplest and most effective method to eliminate 
the noise generated by grounding. In high speed 
application, the general method to eliminate noise is to 
use a complete ground plane technique, and the whole 
ground plane will help distribute heat and reduce EMI 
noise pickup. 
 
Reduce Input-to-Output Coupling 
To reduce the input-to-output coupling, the input traces 
must be placed as far away from the power supply or 
output traces as possible. The sensitive trace must not 
be placed in parallel with the noisy trace in same layer. 
They must be placed perpendicularly in different layers 
to reduce the crosstalk. These PCB layout techniques 
will help to reduce unwanted positive feedback and 
noise. 
Typical Application Circuits 
Difference Amplifier 
The circuit in Figure 2 is a design example of classical 
difference amplifier. If R4/R3 = R2/R1, then VOUT = (VP - 
VN) × R2/R1 + VREF. 
 
Figure 2. Difference Amplifier 
 
High Input Impedance Difference Amplifier 
The circuit in Figure 3 is a design example of high input 
impedance difference amplifier, the added amplifiers at 
the input are used to increase the input impedance and 
eliminate drawback of low input impedance in Figure 2. 
 
Figure 3. High Input Impedance Difference Amplifier 
 
Active Low-Pass Filter 
The circuit in Figure 4 is a design example of active 
low-pass filter, the DC gain is equal to -R2/R1 and the 
-3dB corner frequency is equal to 1/2πR2C. In this 
design, the filter bandwidth must be less than the 
bandwidth of the amplifier, the resistor values must be 
selected as low as possible to reduce ringing or 
oscillation generated by the parasitic parameters in 
PCB layout.
