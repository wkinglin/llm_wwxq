GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM41512 is a battery charger and system power path 
management device with integrated converter and power 
switches for use with single-cell Li-Ion or Li-polymer batteries. 
This highly integrated 3A device is capable of fast charging 
and supports a wide input voltage range suitable for smart 
phones, tablets and portable systems. I2C programming 
makes it a very flexible powering and charger design solution. 
The device includes four main power switches: input reverse 
blocking FET (RBFET, Q1), high-side switching FET for Buck 
or Boost mode (HSFET, Q2), low-side switching FET for Buck 
or Boost mode switching (LSFET, Q3) and battery FET that 
controls the interconnection of the system and battery 
(BATFET, Q4). The bootstrap diode for the high-side gate 
driving is also integrated. The internal power path has a very 
low impedance that reduces the charging time and maximizes 
the battery discharge efficiency. Moreover, the input voltage 
and current regulations provide maximum charging power 
delivery to the battery with various types of input sources. 
A wide range of input sources are supported, including 
standard USB hosts, charging ports and USB compliant high 
voltage adapters. The default input current limit is 
automatically selected based on the built-in USB interface. 
This limit is determined by the detection circuit in the system 
(e.g. USB PHY). SGM41512 is USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 power 
specifications compliant with input current and voltage 
regulation. It also meets USB On-The-Go (OTG) power rating 
specification and is capable to boost the battery voltage to 
supply 5.15V on VBUS with 1.2A (or 0.5A) current limit. 
The system voltage is regulated slightly above the battery 
voltage by the power path management circuit and is kept 
above the programmable minimum system voltage (3.5V by 
default). Therefore, system power is maintained even if the 
battery is completely depleted or removed. Dynamic power 
management 
(DPM) 
feature 
is 
also 
included 
that 
automatically reduces the charge current if the input current 
or voltage limit is reached. If the system load continues to 
increase after reduction of charge current down to zero, the 
power path management provides the deficit from battery by 
discharging battery to the system until the system power 
demand is fulfilled. This is called supplement mode, which 
prevents the input source from overloading. 
Starting and termination of a charging cycle can be 
accomplished without software control. The sensed battery 
voltage is used to decide for starting phase of charging in one 
of the three phases of charging cycle: pre-conditioning, 
constant current or constant voltage. When the charge 
current falls below a preset limit and the battery voltage is 
above recharge threshold, the charger function will 
automatically terminate and end the charging cycle. If the 
voltage of a charged battery falls below the recharge 
threshold, the charger begins another charging cycle. 
Several safety features are provided in the SGM41512 such 
as over-voltage and over-current protections, battery 
temperature monitoring, charging safety timing, thermal 
shutdown and input UVLO. TS pin is connected to an NTC 
thermistor for battery temperature monitoring and protection 
in both charge and Boost modes according to JEITA profile. 
This device also features thermal regulation in which the 
charge current is reduced if the junction temperature exceeds 
80°C or 120℃ (selectable).  
Charging status is reported by the STAT output and 
fault/status bits. A negative pulse is sent to the nINT output 
pin as soon as a fault occurs to notify the host. BATFET reset 
control is provided by nQON pin to exit ship mode or for a full 
system reset. 
The SGM41512 is available in a Green TQFN-4×4-24L package.

STAT 
DO 
Open-Drain Charge Status Output. Use a 10kΩ pull-up to the logic high rail (or an LED + a resistor). The 
STAT pin acts as follows:  
During charge: low (LED ON). 
Charge completed or charger in sleep mode: high (LED OFF). 
Charge suspended (in response to a fault): 1Hz, 50% duty cycle pulses (LED BLINKS). 
The function can be disabled via EN_ICHG_MON[1:0] register. 
5 
SCL 
DI 
I2C Clock Signal. Use a 10kΩ pull-up to the logic high rail. 
6 
SDA 
DIO 
I2C Data Signal. Use a 10kΩ pull-up to the logic high rail. 
7 
nINT 
DO 
Open-Drain Interrupt Output Pin. Use a 10kΩ pull-up to the logic high rail. The nINT pin sends out a 
negative 256μs pulse to the host when a fault occurs or a new charge status updates. 
8, 10 
NC 
— 
Do Not Connect and Leave This Pin Float. 
9 
nCE 
DI 
Charge Enable Input Pin (Active Low). Battery charging is enabled when CHG_CONFIG bit is 1 and nCE 
pin is pulled low. 
11 
TS 
AI 
Temperature Sense Input Pin. Connect to the battery NTC thermistor that is grounded on the other side. To 
program operating temperature window, it can be biased by a resistor divider between REGN and GND. 
Charge suspends if TS voltage goes out of the programmed range. It is recommended to use a 103AT-2 
type thermistor. 
If NTC or TS pin function is not needed, use a 10kΩ/10kΩ pair for the resistor divider. 
12 
nQON 
DI 
BATFET On/Off Control Pin. Use an internal pull-up to a small voltage for maintaining the default high logic 
(whenever a source or battery is available). In the ship mode, the BATFET is off. To exit ship mode and turn 
BATFET on, a logic low pulse with a duration of tSHIPMODE (1s TYP) can be applied to nQON. When VBUS 
source is not connected, a logic low pulse with a duration of tQON_RST (10s TYP) resets the system power 
(SYS) by turning BATFET off for tBATFET_RST (250ms TYP) and then back on to provide a full power reset for 
system. 
13, 14 
BAT 
P 
Battery Positive Terminal Pin. Use a 10µF capacitor between BAT and GND pins close to the device. SYS 
and BAT pins are internally connected by BATFET with current sensing capability.  
15, 16 
SYS 
P 
Connection Point to Converter Output. SYS connects to the converter LC filter output that powers the 
system. BAT to SYS internal current (power from battery to system) is sensed. Connect a 20μF capacitor 
between SYS pin and GND close to the device (in addition to COUT). 
17, 18 
GND 
—

ceramic capacitor from SW pin to BTST pin. 
22 
REGN 
P 
LDO Output that Powers LSFET Driver and Internal Circuits. Internally, the REGN pin is connected to the 
anode of the bootstrap diode. Place a 4.7μF (10V rating) ceramic capacitor between REGN pin and GND.  
It is recommended to place the capacitor close to the REGN pin. The output is typically 4.5V to 5V. 
23 
PMID 
P 
PMID Pin. PMID is the actual higher voltage port of converter (Buck or Boost) and is connected to the drain 
of the reverse blocking MOSFET (RBFET) and the drain of HSFET. Connect a 10μF ceramic capacitor 
from PMID pin to GND. It is the proper point for decoupling of high frequency switching currents. 
24 
VAC 
AI 
Sense Input for DC Input Voltage (Typically from an AC/DC Adaptor). Must be connected to VBUS pin. 
Exposed 
Pad

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
The SGM41512 is a power management and charger device 
for applications such as cell phones and tablets that use high 
capacity single-cell Li-Ion or Li-polymer batteries. The 
SGM41512 can accommodate a wide range of input sources 
including USB, wall adapter and car chargers. It is optimized 
for 5V input (USB voltage) but is capable to operate with input 
voltages from 3.9V up to 13.5V. It also supports JEITA profile 
for battery charging safety at high or low temperatures. 
Automatic power path selection to power the system (SYS) 
from the input source (VBUS), battery (BAT), or both, is 
another feature of the device. Battery charge current is 
programmable and can reach to a maximum of 3A (charge). 
In the Boost mode, the battery voltage is boosted to power 
the VBUS pin (1.2A MAX) when it is a power receiving node 
(USB OTG) that is typically regulated to 5.15V. 
The device may operate in several different modes: 
In HIZ mode, the reverse blocking FET (Q1), internal REGN 
LDO, converter switches and some other parts of the internal 
circuit remain off to save the battery while it is supplying DC 
power to the system through BATFET. 
In the sleep mode, the switching is stopped. The charger goes 
to the sleep mode when the input source voltage (VVAC) is not 
high enough for charging the battery. In other words, VVAC is 
smaller than VBAT + VSLEEP (where VSLEEP is a small threshold) 
and Buck converter is not able to charge, even at its 
maximum duty cycle. The Boost may also go to the sleep 
mode if similar issue happens in the reverse direction (when 
VVAC is almost equal or smaller than VBAT). 
In supplement mode, the input source power is not enough to 
supply system demanded power and the battery assists by 
discharging to the system in parallel, providing the deficit. 
 
Power-On Reset (POR) 
The internal circuit of the device is powered from the greater 
voltage between VVBUS and VBAT. When the voltage of the 
selected source goes above its UVLO level (VVBUS > 
VVBUS_UVLOZ or VBAT > VBAT_UVLOZ), a POR happens and 
activates the sleep comparator, battery depletion comparator 
and BATFET driver. Upon activation, the I2C interface will 
also be ready for communication and all registers reset to 
their default values. 
 
Power-Up from Battery Only (No Input 
Source) 
When only the battery is presented as a source and its 
voltage is above depletion threshold (VBAT_DPL_RISE), the 
BATFET turns on and connects the battery to the system. 
The quiescent current is minimum because the REGN LDO 
remains off. Conduction losses are also low due to small 
RDSON of BATFET. Low losses help to extend the battery run 
time. 
The discharge current through BATFET is continuously 
monitored. In the supplement mode, if a system overload (or 
short) occurs (IBAT > IBATFET_OCP), the BATFET is turned off 
immediately and BATFET_DIS bit is set to 1. The BATFET 
will not enable until the input source is applied or one of the 
BATFET Enable Mode (Exit Ship Mode) methods 
(explained later) is used to activate the BATFET. 
 
Power-Up Process from the Input Power 
Source 
Upon connection of an input source (VBUS), its voltage 
sensed from VAC pin is checked to turn on the internal REGN 
LDO regulator and the bias circuits (no matter if the battery is 
present or not). The input current limit is determined and set 
before the Buck converter is started. The sequences of 
actions when VBUS as input source is powered up are: 
1. Poor power source detection (qualification). 
2. Input power source type detection. (Based on D+/D- 
input. It is used to set the default input current limit 
(IINDPM[4:0]).) 
3. REGN LDO power-up. 
4. Setting of the input voltage limit threshold (VINDPM 
threshold). 
5. DC/DC converter power-up. 
 
Details of the power-up steps are explained in the following 
sections.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Poor Power Source Detection (Qualification) 
When REGN LDO is powered, the input source (adaptor) is 
checked for its type and current capacity. To start the Buck 
converter, the input (VBUS) must meet the following 
conditions: 
1. VVBUS < VVAC_OV. 
2. VVBUS > VVBUS_MIN during tBAD_SRC test period (30ms TYP) in 
which the IBAD_SRC (30mA TYP) current is pulled from VBUS. 
If the test is failed, the conditions are repeatedly checked 
every two seconds. As soon as the input source passes 
qualification, the VBUS_GD bit in status register is set to 1 
and a pulse is sent to the nINT pin to inform the host. Type 
detection will start as next step. 
 
Input Power Source Type Detection 
The input source detection will run through the D+/D- lines 
while REGN LDO is powered and after the VBUS_GD bit is 
set. The SGM41512 can detect the input source types which 
include SDP/DCP and non-standard adapter through D+/D- 
pins following USB BC1.2 specification. A pulse is sent to 
nINT pin to inform the host when the input source type 
detection is completed. Some registers and pins are also 
updated as detailed below: 
1. Input current limit register (the value in the IINDPM[4:0]) is 
changed to set current limit. 
2. PG_STAT (power good) bit is set. 
3. VBUS_STAT[2:0] register is updated to indicate USB or 
adaptor input source types. 
The input current is always limited by the IINDPM[4:0] register 
and the limit can be updated by the host if needed. 
 
Input Current Limit by D+/D- Detection 
The SGM41512 integrates a D+/D- based input source 
detection to set the input current limit when VBUS plug-in. 
When input source is plugged in, the SGM41512 starts 
standard USB BC1.2 detection and set the SDP/DCP related 
input current limit. The non-standard adapter detection is 
applied to set the input current limit, when the Data Contact 
Detection (DCD) timer expires. Please refer to Table 1 and 
Table 2. 
 
REGN LDO Power-Up 
The REGN low dropout regulator powers the internal bias 
circuits, HSFET and LSFET gate drivers and TS rail 
(thermistor pin). The STAT pin can also be pulled up to REGN. 
The REGN enables when the following 2 conditions are 
satisfied and remain valid for a 220ms delay time, otherwise 
the device stays in high impedance mode (HIZ) with REGN 
LDO off. 
1. VVAC > VVAC_PRESENT. 
2. VVAC > VBAT + VSLEEPZ (in Buck mode) or VVBUS < VBAT + 
VSLEEP (in Boost mode). 
In HIZ state, the quiescent current drawn from VBUS is very 
small (less than IVBUS_HIZ). System is only powered by the 
battery in HIZ mode.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Setting of the Input Voltage Limit Threshold (VINDPM 
Threshold) 
A wide voltage range (3.9V to 5.4V) is supported for the input 
voltage limit setting in VINDPM[3:0]. 4.5V is the default for 
USB. 
The device supports dynamic tracking of the battery voltage 
(VINDPM). VDPM_BAT_TRACK[1:0] bits can be used to 
enable  tracking (00 to disable tracking) and set the tracking 
offset value. When the tracking is enabled, the input voltage 
limit will be set to the larger value between the VINDPM[3:0] and 
VBAT + VDPM_BAT_TRACK[1:0]. The VDPM_BAT_TRACK[1:0] 
tracking offset can be set to 200mV, 250mV or 300mV. 
 
DC/DC Converter Power-Up 
The 1.5MHz switching converter composed of LSFET and 
HSFET is enabled and can start switching when the input 
current limit is set. Converter is initiated with a soft start when 
the system voltage is ramped up. The input current is limited 
to 200mA or IINDPM[4:0], whichever is smaller, if SYS 
voltage is less than 2.2V, otherwise the limit is set to 
IINDPM[4:0]. 
The BATFET remains on to charge the battery if the battery 
charging function is enabled, otherwise BATFET turns off. 
When converter operates for battery charging, it acts as an 
efficient, fixed frequency synchronous Buck converter 
regardless of the input/output voltages and currents. However, 
it is capable to switch to PFM mode at light load when 
charging is disabled or when the detected battery voltage is 
less than minimum system voltage setting. PFM operation 
can be enabled or prevented in either Buck or Boost mode 
using the PFM_DIS bit. 
 
Boost Mode 
The SGM41512 supports USB On-The-Go. When a load 
device is connected to the USB port, the converter can 
operate as a step-up synchronous converter (Boost mode) 
with 1.5MHz switching frequency to supply power from the 
battery to that load. The 500mA USB OTG output current limit 
requirement is achieved by programming, however the Boost 
converter can deliver 1.2A to the output (default limit). 
Converter will be set to Boost mode if at least 30ms is passed 
from enabling this mode (OTG_CONFIG bit = 1) and the 
following conditions are satisfied: 
1. VBAT > VBATLOW_OTG. 
2. VVBUS < VBAT + VSLEEP (in sleep mode). 
3. Acceptable voltage range at TS pin (VBHOT < VTS < VBCOLD). 
The output voltage is set to VVBUS = 5.15V and is maintained 
as long as VBAT is above VBATLOW_OTG. The output current can 
reach up to the programmed value by BOOST_LIM bit (0.5A 
or 1.2A). The VBUS_STAT[2:0] status register bits are set to 
111 in Boost mode (OTG). 
To minimize the output overshoot in Boost mode, the device 
starts with PFM first and then switches to PWM. As stated 
before, PFM can be avoided by using PFM_DIS bit in Buck 
and Boost modes. 
 
Host Mode and Default Mode Operation 
with Watchdog Timer 
After a power-on reset (POR), the SGM41512 starts in default 
mode (standalone) with all registers reset as if the watchdog 
timer is expired. When the host is in sleep mode or there is no 
host, the device stays in the default mode in which the 
SGM41512 operates like an autonomous charger. The 
battery is charged for 10 hours (default value for the fast 
charging safety timer). Then the charge stops while Buck 
converter continues to operate to power the system load. In 
this mode WATCHDOG_FAULT bit is high. 
Most of the flexibility features of the SGM41512 become 
available in the host mode when the device is controlled by a 
host with I2C. By setting the WD_RST bit to 1, the charger 
mode changes from default mode to host mode. In this mode 
the WATCHDOG_FAULT bit is low and all device parameters 
can be programmed by the host. To prevent device watchdog 
reset that results in going back to default mode, the host must 
disable the watchdog timer by setting WATCHDOG[1:0] = 00, or 
it must consistently reset the watchdog timer before expiry by 
writing 1 to WD_RST to prevent WATCHDOG_FAULT bit to be 
set. Every time a 1 is written to the WD_RST, the watchdog 
timer will restart counting. Therefore, it should be reset again 
before overflow (expiry) to keep the device in the host mode. 
If the watchdog timer expires (WATCHDOG_FAULT bit = 1), the 
device returns to default mode and all registers are reset to 
their default values except for IINDPM[4:0], VINDPM[3:0], 
BATFET_RST_EN, BATFET_DLY and BATFET_DIS bits that 
keep their values unchanged.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Battery Charging Management 
The SGM41512 is designed for charging single-cell Li-Ion or 
Li-poly batteries with a charge current up to 3A (MAX). The 
battery connection switch (BATFET) is in the charge or 
discharge current path features low on-resistance (28mΩ) to 
allow high efficiency and low voltage drop. 
 
Charging Cycle in Autonomous Mode 
Charging is enabled if CHG_CONFIG = 1 and nCE pin is 
pulled low. In default mode, the SGM41512 runs a charge 
cycle with the default parameters itemized in Table 3. At any 
moment, the host can be controlled by changing to the host 
mode.

Start a New Charging Cycle 
If the converter can start switching and all the following 
conditions are satisfied a new charge cycle starts: 
• NTC temperature fault is not asserted (TS pin). 
• Safety timer fault is not asserted. 
• BATFET is not forced off. (BATFET_DIS bit = 0). 
• Charging enabled (3 conditions: CHG_CONFIG bit = 1, 
ICHG[5:0] register is not 0mA and nCE pin is low). 
• Battery voltage is below the programmed full charge level 
(VREG). 
A new charge cycle starts automatically if battery voltage falls 
below the recharge threshold level (VREG - 100mV or VREG - 
200mV configured by VRECHG bit). Also, if the charge cycle 
is completed, a new charging cycle can be initiated by 
toggling of the nCE pin or CHG_CONFIG bit. 
Normally a charge cycle terminates when the charge voltage 
is above the recharge threshold level and the charging 
current falls below the termination threshold if the device is 
not in thermal regulation or Dynamic Power Management 
(DPM) mode. 
 
Charge Status Report 
STAT is an open-drain output pin that reports the status of 
charge and can drive an LED for indication: a low indicates 
charging is in progress, a high shows charging is completed 
or disabled and alternating low/high (blinking) show a 
charging fault. The STAT may be disabled (keep the open 
drain switch off) by setting EN_ICHG_MON[1:0] = 11. 
The CHRG_STAT[1:0] status register reports the present 
charging phase and status by two bits: 00 = charging disabled, 
01 = in pre-charge, 10 = in fast charging (constant current mode 
or constant voltage mode) and 11 = charging completed. 
A negative pulse is sent on nINT pin to inform the host when a 
charging cycle is completed. 
 
Battery Charging Profile 
The SGM41512 features a full battery charging profile with 
five phases. In the beginning of the cycle, the battery voltage 
(VBAT) is tested, and appropriate current and voltage 
regulation levels are selected as shown in Table 4. 
Depending on the detected status of the battery, the proper 
phase is selected to start or for continuation of the charging 
cycle. The phases are trickle charge (VBAT < 2.2V), 
pre-charge, fast-charge (constant current and constant 
voltage) and optional top-off trickle charge.

Note that in the DPM or thermal regulation modes, normal

current will be less than the value in the register; termination 
is disabled, and the charging safety timer is slowed down by 
counting at half clock rate.

Figure 4. Battery Charging Profile 
 
Charge Termination 
A charge cycle is terminated when the battery voltage is 
higher than the recharge threshold and the charge current 
falls below the programmed termination current. Unless there 
is a high power demand for system and it needs to operate in 
supplement mode, the BATFET turns off at the end of the 
charge cycle. Even after termination, the Buck converter 
operates continuously to supply the system. 
CHRG_STAT[1:0] bits are set to 11 and a negative pulse is 
sent to nINT pint after termination.  
If the charger is regulating input current or input voltage or 
junction temperature instead of charge current, termination 
will be temporarily prevented. EN_TERM bit is a termination 
control bit and can be set to 0 to disable termination before it 
happens. 
At low termination currents (60mA TYP), the offset in the 
internal comparator may give rise to a higher (+10mA to 
+20mA) actual termination current. A delay in termination can 
be added (optional) as a compensation for comparator offset 
using a programmable top-off timer. During the delay, 
constant voltage charge phase continues and gives the falling 
charge current the chance to drop closer to the programmed 
value. The top-off delay timer has the same restrictions of the 
safety timer. As an example, if under some conditions the 
safety timer is suspended, the top-off timer will also be 
suspended or if the safety timer is slowed down, the 
termination timer will also be slowed down. The TOPOFF_ 
ACTIVE bit reports the active/not active status of the top-off 
timer. The CHRG_STAT[1:0] and TOPOFF_ACTIVE bits can 
be read to find status of the termination. 
Any of the following events resets the top-off timer:  
1. Disable to enable transition of nCE (charge enable). 
2. A low to high change in the status of termination. 
3. Set REG_RST bit to 1. 
The setting of the top-off timer is applied at the time of 
termination detection and unless a new charge cycle is 
started, modifying the top-off timer parameters after 
termination has no effect. A negative pulse is sent to nINT 
when top-off timer is started or ended. 
 
Temperature Qualification 
The charging current and voltage of the battery must be 
limited when battery is cold or hot. A thermistor input for 
battery temperature monitoring is included in the device that 
can protect the battery based on JEITA guidelines. There is 
no battery temperature protection when battery is discharging 
to the system (either boosting or not charging).

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Compliance with JEITA Guideline 
JEITA guideline (April 20, 2007 release) is implemented in the 
device for safe charging of the Li-Ion battery. JEITA highlights 
the considerations and limits that should to be considered for 
charging at cold or hot battery temperatures. High charge 
current and voltage must be avoided outside normal 
operating temperatures (typically 0 ℃ and 60 ℃). This 
functionality 
can 
be 
disabled 
if 
not 
needed. 
Four 
temperatures levels are defined by JEITA from T1 (minimum) 
to T4 (maximum). Outside this range charging should be 
stopped. The corresponding voltages sensed by NTC are 
named VT1 to VT4. Due to the sensor negative resistance, a 
higher temperature results in a lower voltage on TS pin. The 
battery cool range is between T1 - T2 and the warm range is 
between T3 - T4. Charge must be limited in the cool and 
warm ranges. 
One of the conditions for starting a charge cycle is having the 
TS voltage within VT1 to VT4 window limits. If during the 
charge, battery gets too cold or too hot and TS voltage 
exceeds the T1 - T4 limits, charging is suspended (zero 
charge current) and the controller waits for the battery 
temperature to come back within the T1 to T4 window. 
JEITA recommends reducing charge current to 1/2 of fast 
charging current or lower at cool temperatures (T1 - T2). For 
warmer temperature (within T3 - T4 range), charge voltage is 
recommended to be kept below 4.1V. 
The SGM41512 exceeds the JEITA requirement by its flexible 
charge parameter settings. At warm temperature range (T3 - 
T4), the charge voltage is set to VREG or 4.1V using the 
JEITA_VSET bit. At cool temperatures (T1 - T2), the current 
setting can be reduced down to 50% or 20% of fast charging 
current selectable by the JEITA_ISET bit.

Boost Mode Temperature Monitoring (Battery Discharge) 
The device is capable to monitor the battery temperature for 
safety during the Boost mode. The temperature must remain 
within the VBCOLD to VBHOT thresholds otherwise the Boost 
mode will be suspended and VBUS_STAT[2:0] bits are set to 
000. Moreover, NTC_FAULT[2:0] bits are updated to report 
Boost mode cold or hot condition. Once the temperature 
returns within the right window, the Boost mode is resumed 
and NTC_FAULT[2:0] bits are cleared to 000 (normal).

Safety Timer 
Abnormal battery conditions may result in prolonged charge 
cycles. An internal safety timer is considered to stop charging 
in 
such 
conditions. 
If 
the 
safety 
time 
is 
expired, 
CHRG_FAULT[1:0] bits are set to 11 and a negative pulse is 
sent to nINT pin. By default the charge time limit is 2 hours if 
the battery voltage does not rise above VBATLOW threshold and 
10 hours if it goes above VBATLOW. This feature is optional and 
can be disabled by clearing EN_TIMER bit. The 10 hours limit 
can also be reduced to 5 hours by clearing CHG_TIMER bit. 
The safety timer counts at half clock rate when charger is 
running under input voltage regulation, input current 
regulation, JEITA cool or thermal regulation because in these 
conditions, the actual charge current is likely to be less than 
the register setting. As an example, if the safety timer is set to 
5 hours and the charger is regulating the input current 
(IINDPM_STAT bit = 1) in the whole charging cycle, the 
actual safety time will be 10 hours. Clearing the TMR2X_EN 
bit will disable the half clock rate feature. 
The safety timer is paused if a fault occurs and charging is 
suspended. It will resume once the fault condition is removed. 
If charging cycle is stopped by a restart or by toggling nCE pin 
or CHG_CONFIG bit, the timer resets and restarts a new 
timing. 
 
Narrow Voltage DC (NVDC) Design in SGM41512 
The SGM41512 features an NVDC design using the BATFET 
that connects the system and battery. By using the linear 
region of the BATFET, the charger regulates the system bus 
voltage (SYS pin) above the minimum setting using Buck 
converter even if the battery voltage is very low. MOSFET 
linear mode allows for the large voltage difference between 
SYS and BAT pins to appear as VDS across the switch while 
conducting and charging battery. SYS_MIN[2:0] register sets 
the minimum system voltage (default 3.5V). If the system is in 
minimum system voltage regulation, VSYS_STAT bit is set. 
The BATFET operates in linear region when the battery 
voltage is lower than the minimum system voltage. The 
system voltage is regulated to 180mV (TYP) above the 
minimum system voltage setting. The battery gradually gets 
charged and its voltage rises above the minimum system 
voltage and lets BATFET to change from linear mode to fully 
turned-on switch such that the voltage difference between the 
system and battery is the small VDS of fully on BATFET. 
The system voltage is always regulated to 50mV (TYP) above 
the battery voltage if: 
1. The charging is terminated. 
2. Charging is disabled and the battery voltage is above the 
minimum system voltage setting. 
 
 
Figure 7. System Voltage vs. Battery Voltage 
 
SGM41512 Dynamic Power Management (DPM) 
The SGM41512 features a dynamic power management 
(DPM). To implement DPM the device always monitors, the 
input current and voltage to regulate power demand from the 
source and avoid input adapter overloading or to meet the 
maximum current limits specified in the USB specs. 
Overloading an input power source may results in either the 
voltage tending to fall below the input voltage limit (VINDPM) or 
the current trying to exceed the input current limit (IINDPM). 
With DPM, the device keeps the VSYS regulated to its 
minimum setting by reducing the battery charge current 
adequately such that the input parameter (voltage or current) 
does not exceed the limit. In other words, charge current is 
reduces to satisfy IIN ≤ IINDPM or VIN ≥ VINDPM whichever occurs 
first. DPM can be either an IIN type (IINDPM) or VIN type 
(VINDPM) depending on which limit is reached. 
Changing to the supplement mode may be required if the 
charge current is decreased and reached to zero while the 
input is still overloaded. In this case, the charger reduces the 
system voltage below the battery voltage to allow operation in 
the supplement mode and provide a portion of system power 
demand from the battery through the BATFET. 
The IINDPM_STAT or VINDPM_STAT status bits are set 
during an IINDPM or VINDPM respectively. Figure 8 
summarizes the DPM behavior (IINDPM type) for a design 
example with a 9V/1.2A adapter, 3.2V battery, 2.8A charge 
current setting and 3.4V minimum system voltage setting.

Battery Supplement Mode 
If the system voltage drops below the battery voltage, the 
BATFET gradually starts to turn on. The threshold margin is 
180mV if VSYS_MIN setting is less than VBAT and 45mV if 
VSYS_MIN setting is larger than VBAT. At low discharge currents, 
the BATFET gate voltage is regulated (RDS modulation) such 
that the BATFET VDS stays at 30mV. At higher currents, the 
BATFET will turn fully on (reaching its lowest RDSON). From 
this point, increasing the discharge current will linearly 
increase the BATFET VDS (determined by RDSON × ID). Using 
the MOSFET linear mode at lower currents prevents swinging 
oscillation of entering and exiting the supplement mode. 
BATFET gate regulation V-I characteristics is shown in Figure 
9. If the battery voltage falls below its minimum depletion, the 
BATFET turns off and exits supplement mode. 
 
Figure 9. BATFET Gate Regulation V-I Curve 
BATFET Control for System Power Reset 
and Ship Mode 
Ship Mode (BATFET Disable) 
Ship mode is usually used when the system is stored or in 
idle state for a long time or is in shipping. In such conditions, it 
is better to completely disconnect battery and make system 
voltage zero to minimize the leakage and extend the battery 
life. To enter ship mode, the BATFET has to be forced off by 
setting BATFET_DIS bit. The BATFET turns off immediately if 
BATFET_DLY bit is 0, or turns off after a tSM_DLY delay (12.5 
seconds) if BATFET_DLY is set. 
 
Exit Ship Mode (BATFET Enable) 
To exit the ship mode and enable the BATFET one of the 
following can be applied: 
With no input power (no operating VBUS): 
1. Connect the adapter to the input with a valid voltage to the 
VBUS input. 
2. Pull nQON pin from logic high to low to enable BATFET for 
example by shorting nQON to GND. The negative pulse width 
should be at least a tSHIPMODE (1s TYP) for deglitching. 
With the chip already powered by VBUS: 
3. Clear BATFET_DIS bit using host and I2C. 
4. Set REG_RST bit to 1 to reset all registers. 
5. Apply a negative pulse to nQON pin (same as 2). 
 
Full System Reset with BATFET Using nQON 
When the input source is not present, the BATFET can act as 
a load on/off switch between the system and battery. This 
feature can be used to apply a power-on reset to the system. 
Host can toggle BATFET_DIS bit to cycle power off/on and 
reset the system. A push-button connected to nQON pin or a 
negative pulse can also be used to manually force a system 
power cycle when BATFET is ON (BATFET_DIS bit = 0). For 
this function, a negative logic pulse with a minimum width of 
tQON_RST (10s TYP) must be applied to the nQON pin that 
results in a temporary BATFET turn off for tBATFET_RST (250ms 
TYP) that automatically turns on afterward. This functionality 
can be disabled by setting BATFET_RST_EN bit to 0.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
In summary the nQON pin controls BATFET and system reset 
in two different ways: 
1. Enable BATFET: Applying an nQON logic high to low 
transition with longer than tSHIPMODE deglitch time (negative 
pulse) turns on BATFET to exit ship mode (Figure 10 left). HIZ 
is also enabled (EN_HIZ = 1) when exiting shipping mode. 
After exiting shipping mode, the host can disable HIZ (EN_HIZ 
= 0). OTG cannot be enabled (OTG_CONFIG = 1) until HIZ is 
disabled. 
2. Reset BATFET: By applying a logic low for a duration of at 
least tQON_RST to nQON pin while VBUS is not powered and 
BATFET is allowed to turn on (BATFET_DIS bit = 0), the 
BATFET turns off for tBATFET_RST and then it is re-enabled 
resulting in a system power-on reset. This function can be 
disabled by clearing BATFET_RST_EN bit (Figure 10 right). 
A typical push button circuit for nQON is given in Figure 11.

Status Outputs Pins (STAT and nINT) 
Power Good Indication (PG_STAT Bit) 
When a good input source is connected to VBUS and input 
type is detected, the PG_STAT status bit goes high. A good 
input source is detected if all following conditions on VVBUS 
are satisfied and input type detection is completed: 
• VVBUS is in the operating range: VVBUS_UVLOZ < VVBUS < VVAC_OV. 
• Device is not in sleep mode: VVBUS > VBAT + VSLEEP. 
• Input source is not poor: VVBUS > VVBUSMIN (3.5V TYP) when 
IBAD_SRC (30mA TYP) loading is applied. (Poor source 
detection.) 
• Completed input source type detection. 
 
Charge Status (STAT Pin) 
Charging state is indicated with the open-drain STAT pin as 
explained in Table 5. This pin is able to drive an LED (see 
Figure 1). The functionality of the STAT pin is disabled if the 
EN_ICHG_MON[1:0] bits are set to 11.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
nINT Interrupt Output Pin 
When a new update occurs in the charger states, a 256μs 
negative pulse is sent through the nINT pin to interrupt the 
host. The host may not continuously monitor the charger 
device and by receiving the interrupt it can react and check 
the charger situation on time. 
The following events can generate an interrupt pulse: 
1. Faults reflected in REG09 register (watchdog, Boost 
overload, charge faults and battery over-voltage). 
2. Charging completed. 
3. D+/D- detection identified a connected source (USB or 
adapter). 
4. Input source voltage entered the "input good" range: 
a) VVBUS exceeded VBAT (not in sleep mode). 
b) VVBUS came below VVAC_OV. 
c) VVBUS remained above VVBUSMIN (3.5V TYP) when 
IBAD_SRC (30mA TYP) load current is applied. 
5. Input removed or out of the "input good" range. 
6. A DPM event (VINDPM or IINDPM) occurred (a maskable 
interrupt). 
Once a fault happens, the INT pulse is asserted once and the 
fault bits are updated in REG09. Fault status is not reset in 
the register until the host reads it. A new fault will not assert a 
new INT pulse until the host reads REG09 and all the 
previous faults are cleared. Therefore in order to read the 
current time faults the host must read REG09 two times 
consecutively. The first read returns the history of the fault 
register status (from the time of the last read or reset) and the 
second one checks the current active faults. As an exception, 
the NTC_FAULT bit reports the actual real time status of TS 
pin. 
REG09 does not support multi-read and multi-write as will be 
explained later. 
 
SGM41512 Protection Features 
Monitoring of Voltage and Current 
During the converter operation, the input and system voltages 
(VBUS and VSYS) and switch currents are constantly 
monitored to assure safe operation of the device in both Buck 
and Boost modes, as will be explained below. 
 
Buck Mode Voltage and Current Monitoring 
1. Input Over-Voltage (ACOV) 
Converter switching will stop as soon as VBUS voltage 
exceeds VVAC_OV over-voltage limit that is programmable by 
OVP[1:0] in REG06. It is selectable between 5.5V, 6.5V 
(default), 10.5V and 14V for USB or 5V, 9V or 12V adaptors 
respectively. 
Each time VBUS exceeds the OVP limit, an INT pulse is 
asserted. As long as the over-voltage persists, the 
CHRG_FAULT[1:0] bits are set to 01 in REG09. Fault will be 
cleared to 00 if the voltage comes back below limit (and a 
hysteresis threshold) and host reads the fault register. 
Charger resumes its normal operation when the voltage 
comes back below OVP limit. 
2. System Over-Voltage (SYSOVP) 
During a system load transient, the device clamps the system 
voltage to protect the system components from over-voltage. 
The SYSOVP over-voltage limit threshold is 350mV + 
VSYS_MIN (programmed minimum system regulation voltage + 
350mV). Once a SYSOVP occurs, switching stops to clamp 
any overshoot and a 30mA sink current is applied to SYS to 
pull the voltage down. 
 
Boost Mode Voltage and Current Monitoring 
In Boost mode the RBFET (reverse blocking) and LSFET 
(low-side switch) FET currents and VBUS voltage are 
monitored for protection. 
1. Soft-Start on VBUS 
Boost mode begins with a soft-start to prevent large inrush 
currents when it is enabled. 
2. Output Short Protection for VBUS 
Short circuit protection is provided for VBUS output in Boost 
mode. To accept different types of load connected to VBUS 
and OTG adaptation, an accurate constant current regulation 
control is implemented for Boost mode. In case of a short 
circuit on VBUS pin, the Q1 turns off and retries 7 times 
(Hiccup). If short is not removed after retries, the OTG will be 
disabled by clearing OTG_CONFIG bit. Also, an INT pulse is 
sent and the BOOST_FAULT bit is set to 1 in REG09. When 
the host activates the Boost mode again, the BOOST_FAULT 
bit will be cleared. 
3. Output Over-Voltage Protection for VBUS 
In Boost mode, converter stops switching and exits Boost 
mode (by clearing OTG_CONFIG bit) if VBUS voltage rises 
above regulation and exceeds the VOTG_OVP over-voltage limit 
(6.015V TYP). An INT pulse is sent and the BOOST_FAULT 
bit is set 1. 
 
SGM41512 Thermal Regulation and Shutdown 
Buck Mode Thermal Protections 
Internal junction temperature (TJ) is always monitored to 
avoid overheating. A limit of +120 ℃ is considered for 
maximum IC surface temperature in Buck mode and if TJ 
intends to exceed this level, the device reduces the charge 
current to keep maximum temperature limited to 120°C 
(thermal regulation mode) and sets the THERM_STAT bit to 1. 
As expected, the actual charging current is usually lower than 
programmed value during thermal regulation. Therefore, the 
safety timer runs at half clock rate and charge termination is 
disabled during thermal regulation.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
If the junction temperature exceeds TSHUT (+150℃), thermal 
shutdown protection arise in which the converter and 
BATFET are turned off, CHRG_FAULT[1:0] bits are set to 10 
in the fault register and an INT pulse is sent.  
When the device recovers and TJ falls below the hysteresis 
band of TSHUT_HYS (20℃ under TSHUT), the converter and 
BATFET resume automatically. 
 
Boost Mode Thermal Protections 
Similar to Buck mode, TJ is monitored in Boost mode for 
thermal shutdown protection. If junction temperature exceeds 
TSHUT (+150℃), BATFET will turn off and the Boost mode will 
be disabled (OTG_CONFIG bit clears). BATFET will resume If 
TJ falls below the hysteresis band of TSHUT_HYS (20℃ under 
TSHUT). The Boost mode can recover again by re-enabling 
OTG_CONFIG bit by host. 
 
Battery Protections 
Battery Over-Voltage Protection (BATOVP) 
The over-voltage limit for the battery is 4% above the battery 
regulation voltage setting. In case of a BATOVP, charging 
stops right away, the BAT_FAULT bit is set to 1 and an INT 
pulse is sent. 
 
Battery Over-Discharge Protection 
If battery discharges too much and VBAT falls below the 
depletion level (VBAT_DPL_FALL), the device turns off BATFET to 
protect battery. This protection is latched and is not recovered 
until an input source is connected to the VBUS pin. In such 
condition, the battery will start charging with the small ISHORT 
current (60mA TYP) first as long as VBAT < VSHORTZ. When 
battery voltage is increased and VSHORTZ < VBAT < VBATLOW, 
the charge current will increase to the pre-charge current 
level programmed in the IPRECHG[3:0] register. 
 
Battery Over-Current Protection for System 
The BATFET will latch off, if its current limit is exceeded due to 
a short or large overload on the system (IBAT > IBATOP). To reset 
this latch off and enable BATFET, the "Exit Ship Mode" 
procedure must be followed. 
 
I2C Serial Interface and Data Communication 
Standard I2C interface is used to program SGM41512 
parameters and get status reports. I2C is well known 2 wire 
serial communication interface that can connect one (or more) 
master device(s) to some slave devices for two-way 
communication. The bus lines are named serial data (SDA) 
and serial clock (SCL). The device that initiates a data 
transfer is a master. A master generates the SCL signal. 
Slave devices have unique addresses to identify. A master is 
typically a micro controller or a digital signal processor. 
The SGM41512 operates as a slave device that address is 
0x6B (6BH). It has twelve 8-bit registers, numbered from 
REG00 to REG0B. A register read beyond REG0B (0x0B) 
returns 0xFF. 
 
Physical Layer 
The standard I2C interface of SGM41512 supports standard 
mode and fast mode communication speeds. The frequency 
of stand mode is up to 100kbits/s, while the fast mode is up to 
400kbits/s. Bus lines are pulled high by weak current source 
or pull-up resistors and in logic high state with no clocking 
when the bus is free. The SDA and SCL are open-drain pins. 
 
I2C Data Communication 
START and STOP Conditions 
A transaction is started by taking control of the bus by master 
if the bus is free. The transaction is terminated by releasing 
the bus when the data transfer job is done as shown in Figure 
12. All transactions begin by the master who applies a 
START condition on the bus lines to take over the bus and 
exchange data. At the end, the master terminates the 
transaction by applying one (or more) STOP condition. 
START condition is defined when SCL is high and a high to 
low transition on the SDA is generated by master. Similarly, a 
STOP is defined when SCL is high and SDA goes from low to 
high. START and STOP are always generated by a master. 
After a START and before a STOP the bus is considered 
busy. 
 
 
 
Figure 12. I2C Bus in START and STOP Conditions 
 
Data Bit Transmission and Validity 
Data bit (high or low) must remain stable during clock HIGH 
period. The state of SDA can only change when SCL is LOW. 
For each data bit transmission, one clock pulse is generated 
by the master. Bit transfer in I2C is shown in Figure 13.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Byte Format 
Data is transmitted in 8-bit packets (one byte at a time). The 
number of bytes in one transaction is not limited. In each 
packet the 8 bits are sent successively with the Most Significant 
Bit (MSB) first. An acknowledge (or not-acknowledge) bit must 
come after the 8 data bits. This bit informs the transmitter 
whether the receiver is ready to proceed for the next byte or 
not. Figure 14 shows the byte transfer process with I2C 
interface. 
 
Acknowledge (ACK) and Not Acknowledge (NCK) 
After 
transmission 
of 
each 
byte 
by 
transmitter 
an 
acknowledge bit is replied by the receiver as ninth bit. With 
the acknowledge bit the receiver informs the transmitter that 
the byte has been received, and another byte is expected or 
can be sent (ACK) or it is not expected (NCK = not ACK). 
Clock (SCL) is always generated by the master, including for 
the acknowledge clock pulse, no matter who is acting as 
transmitter or receiver. SDA line is released for receiver 
control during the acknowledge clock pulse and the receiver 
can pull the SDA line low as ACK (reply a 0 bit) or let it be 
high as NCK during the SCL high pulse. After that the master 
can either STOP (P) to end the transaction or send a new 
START (S) condition to start a new transfer (called repeated 
start). For example, when master wants to read a register in 
slave, one start is needed to send the slave address and 
register address and then without a stop condition another 
start is sent by master to initiate the receiving transaction 
from slave. Master then sends the STOP condition and 
releases the bus. 
Data Direction Bit and Addressing Slaves 
The first byte sent by master after the START is always the 
target slave address (7 bits) and an eighth data-direction bit 
(R/W). R/W bit is 0 for a WRITE transaction and 1 for READ 
(when master is asking for data). Data direction is the same 
for all next bytes of the transaction. To reverse it, a new 
START or repeated START condition must be sent by master 
(STOP will end the transaction). Usually the second byte is a 
WRITE sending the register address that is supposed to be 
accesses in the next byte(s). The data transfer transaction is 
shown in Figure 15. 
WRITE: If the master wants to write in the register, the third 
byte can be written directly as shown in Figure 16 for a single 
write data transfer. After receiving the ACK, master may issue 
a STOP condition to end the transaction or send the next 
register data, which will be written to the next address in a 
slave as multi-write. A STOP is needed after sending the last 
data.  
READ: If the master wants to read a single register (Figure 
17), it sends a new START condition along with device 
address with R/W bit = 1. After ACK is received, master reads 
the SDA line to receive the content of the register. Master 
replies with NCK to inform slave that no more data is needed 
(single read) or it can send an ACK to request for sending the 
next register content (multi-read). This can continue until a 
NCK is sent by master. A STOP must be sent by master in 
any case to end the transaction. 
In the figures, the data blocks with gray background shows 
the bits sent by master and the white background represent 
data bits sent by slave. If the register address is not defined, 
the device replies with NCK and goes back to the I2C slave 
idle state.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Data Transactions with Multi-Read or Multi-Write 
Multi-read and multi-write are supported by SGM41512 for 
REG00 through REG0B registers, except for REG09 as 
explained in Figure 18 and Figure 19. REG09 (fault register), 
is skipped in multi-read/writes. In the multi-write, every new 
data byte sent by master is written to the next register of the 
device. A STOP is sent whenever master is done with writing 
into device registers. 
In a multi-read transaction, after receiving the first register 
data (whose address is already written to the slave), the 
master replies with an ACK to ask the slave for sending the 
next register data. This can continue as much as it is needed 
by master. Master sends back an NCK after the last received 
byte and issues an STOP condition.

I2C Controlled 3A Single-Cell Battery Charger with High Input Voltage

Capability and Narrow Voltage DC (NVDC) Power Path Management

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
The SGM41512 is typically used as a charger with power 
path management in smart phones, tablets and other portable 
devices. In a design, it comes along with a host controller (a 
processor with I2C interface) and a single-cell Li-Ion or 
Li-polymer battery. 
 
Detailed Design Procedure 
Inductor Design 
Small energy storage elements (inductor and capacitor) can 
be used thanks to the high frequency (1.5MHz) switching 
converter used in the SGM41512. Inductor should tolerate 
currents higher than the maximum charge current (ICHG) plus 
half the inductor peak to peak ripple current (∆I) without 
saturation: 
 
∆

(3) 
The inductor ripple current is determined by the input voltage 
(VVBUS), duty cycle (D = VBAT/VVBUS), switching frequency (fS = 
1.5MHz) and the inductance (L). In CCM we have:

(4) 
Inductor ripple current is maximum when D ≈ 0.5. If the input 
voltage range (VVBUS) is limited higher D values can be 
considered.  
In a practical designs, inductor peak to peak current ripple is 
selected in a range between 20% to 40% of the maximum DC 
current ∆I = (0.2 ~ 0.4) × ICHG for a good trade-off between 
inductor size and efficiency. Selecting higher ripple allows 
choosing of smaller inductance. 
For each application, VVBUS and ICHG are known, so L can be 
calculated from (4) and current rating of the inductor can be 
selected from (3). Choose an inductor that has small DCR 
and core losses at 1.5MHz to have high efficiency and cool 
operation at full load. 
 
Input Capacitor Design 
Select low ESR ceramic input capacitor (X7R or X5R) with 
sufficient voltage and RMS ripple current rating for decoupling 
of the input switching ripple current (ICIN). The RMS ripple 
current in the worst case is around the ICHG/2 when D ≈ 0.5. If 
the converter does not operate at D ≈ 50%, the worst case 
capacitor RMS current can be estimated from (5) in which D 
is the closest operating duty cycle to 0.5.

(5) 
For SGM41512 place CIN across PMID and GND pins close 
to the chip. Voltage rating of the capacitor must be at least 25% 
higher than the normal input voltage to minimize voltage 
derating. For a 15V input voltage, the preferred rating is 25V 
or higher. 
A CIN = 22μF is suggested. 
 
Output Capacitor Design 
The output capacitance (on the system) must have enough 
RMS (ripple) current rating to carry the inductor switching 
ripple and provide enough energy for system transient current 
demands. ICOUT (COUT RMS current) can be calculated by:

(7) 
Increasing L or COUT (the LC filter) can reduce the ripple.  
The internal loop compensation of the device is optimized for > 
22μF ceramic output capacitor. 10V, X7R (or X5R) ceramic 
capacitors are recommended for the output. 
The design is based on Buck mode operation that has almost 
2.5 times higher current rating (3A) compared to the Boost 
mode (1.2A). The design is sufficient for proper Boost 
operation, because converter is bidirectional and only the 
direction of currents is reversed. 
 
Input Power Supply Considerations 
To power the system from the SGM41512, either an input 
power source with a voltage between 3.9V to 13.5V and at 
least 100mA current rating should power VBUS, or a 
single-cell Li-Ion battery with voltage higher than VBAT_UVLOZ 
should be connected to BAT pin of the device. The input 
source must have enough current rating to allow maximum 
power delivery through charger (Buck converter) to the 
system.

Layout Guidelines 
The switching node (SW) creates very high frequency noises 
several times higher than fSW (1.5MHz) due to sharp rise and 
fall of the voltage and current in the switches. To reduce the 
ringing issues and noise generation designing a proper layout 
is important to minimize the current path impedance and loop 
area. A graphical guideline for the current loops and their 
frequency content is provided in Figure 20. The following 
considerations can help making a better layout.  
1. Place the input capacitor between PMID and GND pins as 
close as possible to the chip with shortest copper connections 
(avoid vias). Choose the smallest capacitor size. 
2. Connect one pin of the inductor as close as possible to the 
SW pin of the device and minimize the copper area 
connected to the SW node to reduce capacitive coupling from 
SW area to nearby signal traces. This decreases the noise 
induced 
through 
parasitic 
stray 
capacitances 
and 
displacement currents to other conductors. SW connection 
should be wide enough to carry the charging current. Keep 
other signals and traces away from SW if possible. 
3. Place output capacitor GND pin as close as possible to the 
GND pin of the device and the GND pin of input capacitor CIN. 
It is better to avoid using vias for these connections and keep 
the high frequency current paths very short and on the same 
layer. A GND copper layer under the component layer helps 
reducing noise emissions. Pay attention to the DC current 
and AC current paths in the layout and keep them short and 
decoupled as much as possible. 
4. For analog signals, it is better to use a separate analog 
ground (AGND) branched only at one point from GND pin. To 
avoid high current flow through the AGND path, it should be 
connected to GND only at one point (preferably the GND pin). 
5. Place decoupling capacitors close to the IC pins with 
shortest possible copper connections. 
6. Solder the exposed thermal pad of the package to the PCB 
ground planes. Ensure that there are enough thermal vias 
directly under the IC, connecting to the ground plane on the 
other layers for better heat dissipation and cooling of the 
device. 
7. Select proper sizes for the vias and ensure enough copper 
is available to carry the current for a given current path. Vias 
usually have some considerable parasitic inductance and 
resistance.
