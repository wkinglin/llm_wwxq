GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM8557H-1AQ is a low noise, high precision 
CMOS operational amplifier for automotive applications. 
It provides a high output current of 230mA and rail-to-rail 
output operation from a range of 2.7V to 5.5V single 
supply. 
The SGM8557H-1AQ offers low input offset voltage 
and low input offset voltage drift. The device also can 
achieve a high 15MHz gain-bandwidth product and a 
high 7.5V/μs slew rate. 
The SGM8557H-1AQ is specifically designed to drive 
high current load, such as 32Ω headset, VBIAS of RF 
power amplifier, etc. 
The SGM8557H-1AQ is available in a Green SOT-23-5 
package. It operates over an ambient temperature 
range of -40℃ to +125℃. 
This device is AEC-Q100 qualified (Automotive 
Electronics Council (AEC) standard Q100 Grade 1) and 
it is suitable for automotive applications.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

APPLICATIONS INFORMATION (continued) 
Cancel Input Capacitance 
The CIN (20pF TYP) at inverting input pin will generate 
a pole at frequency (2πR′CIN)-1, where R′ is the parallel 
combination of the gain-setting resistor for the inverting 
or non-inverting amplifier in Figure 3. If the pole-frequency 
is less than or comparable to the unity-gain bandwidth 
(15MHz), the phase margin will be reduced, ringing in 
the step response or sustained oscillation will be 
generated. To cancel this pole, CF is used to compensate 
CIN in Figure 3. Equation 3 gives the CF feedback 
capacitance. 
CF = 8×(R/RF) pF             (3) 
where: 
RF is the feedback resistor. 
R is the gain-setting resistor.

Input Current-Limit Protection 
For ESD diode clamping protection, when the current 
flowing through ESD diode exceeds the maximum 
rating value, the ESD diode and amplifier will be 
damaged, so current-limit protection will be added in 
some applications. One resistor is selected to limit the 
current not to exceed the maximum rating value. In 
Figure 4, a series input resistor is used to limit the input 
current to less than 10mA, but the drawback of this 
current-limit resistor is to contribute thermal noise at the 
amplifier input. If this resistor must be added, its value 
must be selected as small as possible.

Rail-to-Rail Output 
The SGM8557H-1AQ supports rail-to-rail output operation. 
In single power supply application, for example, when 
+VS = 5V, -VS = GND, 2kΩ load resistor is tied from 
OUT pin to VS/2, the typical output swing range is from 
0.008V to 4.992V.

APPLICATIONS INFORMATION (continued) 
Driving Capacitive Loads 
The SGM8557H-1AQ is designed for unity-gain stable for 
capacitive load up to 780pF. In Figure 5, it shows the 
transient response with capacitive load (CL). If greater 
capacitive load must be driven in application, the circuit 
in Figure 6 can be used. In this circuit, the IR drop 
voltage generated by RISO is compensated by feedback 
loop.

Power Supply Decoupling and Layout 
A clean and low noise power supply is very important in 
amplifier circuit design, besides of input signal noise, 
the power supply is one of important source of noise to 
the amplifiers through +VS and -VS pins. Power supply 
bypassing is an effective method to clear up the noise 
at power supply, and the low impedance path to ground 
of decoupling capacitor will bypass the noise to GND. 
In application, 10μF ceramic capacitor paralleled with 
0.1μF or 0.01μF ceramic capacitor is used in Figure 7. 
The ceramic capacitors should be placed as close as 
possible to +VS and -VS power supply pins.
