JUNE2017–REV.A.2 
GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM3803 is a constant frequency, current mode, 
synchronous step-up switching regulator with 200mA 
negative charge pump inverter which generates an 
unregulated negative output voltage from an input 
voltage range of 1.4V to 5.5V. The device is typically 
used to generate +5V and -5V from battery. 
High switching frequency minimizes the sizes of 
inductor and capacitor. The device requires only three 
external capacitors for a complete DC/DC charge pump 
inverter. Integrated power MOSFETs and internal 
compensation of boost DC/DC make the SGM3803 
simple to use and optimized for compact solutions. 
The negative charge pump inverter of the SGM3803 is 
capable of providing 200mA output current. The typical 
conversion efficiency exceeds 80% over a wide output 
current range. 
The SGM3803 boost DC/DC enters the power-save 
mode at light loads to maintain high efficiency. 
Anti-ringing control circuitry reduces EMI concerns by 
damping the inductor in discontinuous mode. The 
SGM3803 
boost 
DC/DC 
provides 
true 
output 
disconnect, thus allowing VOUT1 to go to zero volt during 
shutdown without drawing any current from the input 
source. The SGM3803 supports 1.8V logic for control. 
The output voltage of the boost DC/DC can be 
programmed by an external resistor divider. Boost 
DC/DC and negative charge pump inverter have 
independent enable control. 
The device is available in a TDFN-3×3-12L package. It 
operates over an ambient temperature range of -40℃ 
to +85℃.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.
