GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The 74LVC245A is an octal bus transceiver with 3-state 
outputs, which can accept supply voltage range from 
1.65V to 3.6V. The device is mainly used for 
asynchronous communication between data buses. 
Both 3.3V and 5V devices can drive inputs, enabling 
this device to operate as translator in a mixed 3.3V and 
5V system environment.  
The An and Bn are 8-bit data input-output ports, DIR is 
the direction control input and OE

ത
ത is the output enable 
input. When DIR is set high, it allows transmission from 
An to Bn. When DIR is set low, it allows transmission 
from Bn to An. OE
ത

ത
ത
ത can be used to make the outputs 
disabled so that the buses are effectively isolated.

ത
ത
ത should be connected to VCC by using a pull-up 
resistor to ensure the high-impedance state in the 
period of power-up or power-down, and the minimum 
resistance depends on the current-sinking capability of 
the driver.  
This device is highly suitable for partial power-down 
applications using power-off leakage current (IOFF) circuit. 
When the device is powered down, the current backflow 
will be prevented from passing through the device.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
1. Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum 
Ratings may cause permanent damage to the device. 
Exposure to absolute maximum rating conditions for extended 
periods may affect reliability. Functional operation of the 
device at any conditions beyond those indicated in the 
Recommended Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
2. The minimum input voltage ratings and output voltage 
ratings may be exceeded if the input and output current ratings 
are observed. 
3. The performance capability of a high-performance integrated 
circuit in conjunction with its thermal environment can create 
junction temperatures which are detrimental to reliability. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.
