ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

Synchronous Boost Converter

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
The SGM6611C is a synchronous Boost converter with 
two integrated power FETs and is capable of delivering 
up to 9.5A (TYP) switch current. The device adopts the 
1.1MHz fixed frequency peak current mode control 
architecture to regulate the output voltage. The 
SGM6611C automatically operates in pulse frequency 
modulation (PFM) mode at light load to improve the 
efficiency. As the load current increases, the device 
enters PWM operation to provide a fixed switching 
frequency. The device can offer excellent line and load 
transient responses, in addition, the compensation 
network is configured externally which brings flexibility 
to applications with different output capacitor and 
inductor selections. The device also implements 
various protection features such as cycle-by-cycle 
current limit for abnormal load conditions, output 
over-voltage protection and thermal shutdown.  
 
Enable and Disable 
The input voltage applied to SGM6611C needs to be 
higher than the maximum UVLO threshold of 2.5V and 
the EN pin voltage is higher than 1.2V to enable the 
device. Pulling the EN pin below 0.4V disables the 
device, where all internal blocks are turned off, and no 
voltage is present on VCC pin. While disabled, the 
device stops switching and enters shutdown mode with 
less than 1.1μA current consumed. VIN and VOUT are 
connected through the body diode of the high-side 
rectifier FET in the shutdown mode. 
 
Adjustable Peak Current Limit 
The peak current mode control provides inherent 
over-current protection as the device monitors the 
changes of inductor current. As the peak current 
reaches 9.5A (TYP), the device stops switching and 
turning off the low-side FET to stop inductor current to 
rise. The peak current limit threshold is programmable 
via a resistor connected on ILIM pin to ground. Use 
Equation below to calculate the desired current limit 
threshold.

ILIM

I
R
 
(1) 
where RILIM is the resistor connected between the ILIM 
pin and ground, and ILIM is the peak current limit. 
When ILIM is 9.5A (TYP), the value of the resistor is 
127kΩ. 
 
Soft-Start 
The SGM6611C implements internal soft-start function 
of 4ms (TYP). When enabled, the device slowly ramps 
the reference voltage to prevent large inrush current 
during startup.  
 
Over-Voltage Protection (OVP) 
The device implements over-voltage protection to 
prevent the device from damage and protect the device 
connected to the output of SGM6611C. When the 
voltage present on the VOUT pin exceeds 13.2V (TYP), 
the device stops switching immediately to prevent the 
output voltage from rising. As the output voltage drops 
below 150mV (TYP) of hysteresis voltage that is lower 
than the OVP threshold, the device resumes operation.  
  
Under-Voltage Lockout (UVLO) 
An under-voltage lockout (UVLO) circuit prevents the 
device from malfunctioning at low input voltage and the 
battery from excessive discharge. The SGM6611C has 
both VIN UVLO function and VCC UVLO function. It 
disables the device from switching when the falling 
voltage at the VIN pin trips the UVLO threshold VIN_UVLO, 
which is typically 2.4V. The input UVLO function 
implements a 100mV hysteresis to prevent the false 
turn-on due to line voltage variations, where the device 
cannot be turned on until the input voltage increases to 
2.5V or higher. When the falling voltage at the VCC pin 
trips the UVLO threshold VCC_UVLO, typically 2.1V, the 
device is also disabled. 
 
Thermal Shutdown 
A thermal shutdown function is implemented to prevent 
damage caused by excessive heat and power 
dissipation. Once a junction temperature of +160℃
(TYP) is exceeded, the device is shut down. The device 
is released from shutdown automatically when the 
junction temperature decreases by 20℃.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Device Functional Modes 
Operation 
The SGM6611C adopts the fixed frequency pulse width 
modulation (PWM) mode in moderate to heavy load 
condition. At the start of each clock cycle, the low-side 
power FET is turned on to ramp up the inductor current 
until the inductor current reaches the level determined 
by the output of the internal error amplifier. When the 
current is reached, LS FET is turned off, and a dead 
time is issued which is used to prevent shoot-through. 
During the dead time, the inductor current flows 
through the body diode of the high-side FET. As the 
dead time ends, the high-side FET is turned on to ramp 
down the inductor current to replenish the output 
capacitor and deliver current to the load. This cycle 
repeats with a 1.1MHz switching frequency.  
PFM Mode 
In order to improve the light load efficiency, the 
SGM6611C implements PFM operation at light load. At 
light load, the internal error amplifier’s output decreases 
to lower the inductor current. As the current reaches 
zero during the low-side off-time, the high-side FET 
turns off till the next switching cycle starts. As the load 
current decreases further, the output of the error 
amplifier reaches a voltage that is corresponds to 
ILIM/10. The output of the error amplifier is clamped at 
this value and no longer decreases. The SGM6611C 
automatically adjusts the off-time in PFM mode to meet 
the load demand, and lower load current results in 
longer off-time. The output voltage is regulated to 0.2% 
higher than the nominal programmed output voltage at 
PFM mode. The SGM6611C is capable of achieving 
above 70% efficiency when the load current is less than 
1mA. Output voltage ripple is also lower in PFM mode 
since the peak inductor current is lower.

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
The SGM6611C is capable of supporting up to 12.6V 
output voltage, while providing 9.5A (TYP) continuous 
switch current. The device automatically operates in 
PFM mode in light load. At medium to heavy load, the 
device switches to PWM operation. PFM mode 
provides high light load efficiency while PWM mode 
provides constant switching frequency. The fixed 
frequency peak current mode control offers excellent 
line and load transient responses. The external loop 
compensation enables design flexibility with various 
inductor and output capacitor combinations.

Setting Peak Current Limit 
The peak current limit is programmed via an external 
resistor on ILIM pin. The resistor value can be 
calculated by Equation 2:

                (2) 
where RILIM is the resistor connected between the ILIM 
pin and ground, and ILIM is the switching peak current 
limit. 
A standard 127kΩ provides the 9.5A typical current 
limit. Considering variation due to tolerance and 
temperature, the worst-case required peak current 
should be lower than the minimal current limit rating to 
ensure that the SGM6611C can regulate the output 
voltage. For Boost converter, the worst case occurs at 
the lowest VIN and the highest load current.

resistive divider connected to FB pin. Use Equation 
below to program the output voltage. R1 is the top

resistor. The recommended value for R2 should be less 
than 120kΩ.

Inductor Selection 
Inductor is an essential element for DC/DC switch 
mode power supplies regardless of topology. Inductor 
serves as the energy storage element for power 
conversion. Inductance and inductor’s saturation 
current are the two most important criterions for 
inductor selection. For general rule of thumb, the 
selected inductance should provide a peak-to-peak 
ripple current that is around 30% of the average 
inductor current at full load and nominal input voltage. 
The average inductor current for a Boost converter is 
the input current. The SGM6611C is optimized to 
operate with inductor values between 0.47μH and 
2.2μH. Lower inductance part generally has smaller 
size while providing sufficient saturation current rating, 
and larger inductance provides lower peak-to-peak 
ripple current, which helps to maximize the output 
current delivery.  
Equations 4 to 6 show the calculated key parameters 
for selecting the inductor. The selected inductor should 
meet the worst case that occurs at minimum input 
voltage and maximal load current. Margin should be 
added to cover inductance de-rating and conversion 
efficiency. 
For Boost converter, the average inductor current is the 
average input current, Equation 4 is used to calculate 
the average inductor current:

where VOUT is the output voltage, IOUT is the output

where IPP is the inductor peak-to-peak ripple, L is the 
inductor value, fSW is the switching frequency, VOUT is 
the output voltage, and VIN is the input voltage. 
The peak inductor current is the sum of average current 
plus half of the peak-to-peak inductor current shown in 
Equation 6:

The selected inductor should have the saturation 
current rating higher than the calculated peak current, 
and the calculated peak current should be lower than 
the peak current limit of SGM6611C.  
Inductor’s DCR, material type, DC/DC’s power FET 
resistance and switching speed affect the overall 
efficiency of the converter, therefore, careful inductor 
selection is critical to ensure good performance.

Input Capacitor Selection 
Boost converter’s input capacitor has continuous 
current throughout the entire switching cycle. A 10µF 
ceramic capacitor is recommended to place between 
the VIN pin and GND pin of SGM6611C as close as 
possible. For the applications where the SGM6611C is 
located far away from the input source, a 47µF or 
higher capacitance capacitor is recommended to damp 
the wiring harness’s inductance. 
The VCC pin is the output of the internal regulator, a 
1µF ceramic capacitor is recommended to place on the 
VCC pin. 
Output Capacitor Selection 
The output capacitors of Boost converter dictate the 
output voltage ripple and load transient response. 
Equation 7 is used to estimate the necessary 
capacitance to achieve the desired output voltage 
ripple, where ΔV is the maximum allowed ripple. Three 
22μF ceramic output capacitors are recommended for 
SGM6611C. Due to the DC de-rating effect of the 
ceramic capacitor, margin should be considered, where 
higher capacitance improves the transient response.

Loop Stability 
The compensation network of SGM6611C is completed 
externally to improve design flexibility. The SGM6611C 
implements a transconductance error amplifier, where 
the COMP pin is the output of the internal error 
amplifier. A Type-II compensation network consisting of 
R5, C5 and C6 connected on COMP pin is used to 
configure the loop response of SGM6611C. 
The power stage small signal loop response for peak 
current control can be shown by Equation 9.

fCOMP2 are the pole's frequency of the compensation 
network, and fCOMZ is the zero's frequency of the 
compensation network. 
Once the error amplifier and power stage’s poles and 
zeros are determined, the compensation network’s 
component value can be designed. The designed loop 
crossover frequency fC should be within 1/5 of the 
RHPZ frequency (fRHPZ) or 1/10 of the switching 
frequency. Higher crossover frequency could improve 
the transient response. However, the crossover 
frequency should be designed to avoid instability.

To measure good loop compensation design, greater 
than 45° of phase margin and greater than 10dB gain 
margin could provide good loop stability and avoid 
output voltage ringing during load and line transient.

Layout Guidelines 
In addition to component selection, layout is a critical 
step to ensure the performance of any switch mode 
power supplies. Poor layout could result in system 
instability, EMI failure, and device damage. Thus, place 
the inductor, input and output capacitors as close to the 
IC as possible, and use wide and short traces for 
current carrying traces to minimize PCB inductance. 
For Boost converter, the output capacitor’s current loop 
from VOUT pin back to the GND pin of the device 
should be as small as possible. Use small traces and 
small copper area of all traces connected to the SW 
node to minimize SW node vias and to prevent 
radiation 
of 
high-frequency 
noise. 
It 
is 
also 
recommended to place a ground plane below the 
DC/DC to minimize inter plane coupling.
