GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The 74AVC16T245 is a 16-bit dual-supply translating 
transceiver with configurable voltage translation and 
3-state outputs. The device can be used as two 8-bit 
transceivers or one 16-bit transceiver. The nAn and 
nBn are two 8-bit input-output data ports. nDIR are the 
direction control inputs and nOE

ത
ത
ത are the output enable 
inputs. VCCA and VCCB are the supply pins. The supply 
voltage of VCCA and VCCB can range from 0.8V to 3.6V, 
making the device suitable for bidirectional translating 
among any of the 0.8V, 1.2V, 1.5V, 1.8V, 2.5V and 
3.3V voltage nodes. The nAn, nDIR and nOE
ത

ത
ത signals 
are referenced to VCCA and nBn signals are referenced 
to VCCB. 
When nDIR is set high, it allows transmission from nAn 
to nBn. When nDIR is set low, it allows transmission 
from nBn to nAn. nOE

ത can be used to make the 
outputs disabled so that the buses are effectively 
isolated. In suspend mode, both nAn and nBn are in the 
high-impedance state when either VCCA or VCCB input is 
at GND level. 
This device is highly suitable for partial power-down 
applications using power-off leakage current (IOFF) circuit. 
When the device is powered down, the current backflow 
will be prevented from passing through the device.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
1. Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
2. The minimum input voltage ratings and output voltage ratings 
may be exceeded if the input and output current ratings are 
observed. 
3. The performance capability of a high-performance integrated 
circuit in conjunction with its thermal environment can create 
junction temperatures which are detrimental to reliability. 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.
