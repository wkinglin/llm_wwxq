GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM822 is an integrated, 3-rail power sequencer. 
It controls the power-up and power-down sequence of 
three power supplies by pulling their enable or 
shutdown pins high or low. Staggered start sequence 
can avoid the impact of latch conditions or large inrush 
current on system reliability. 
This simple sequencer has three open-drain output 
flags. When the enable (EN) pin is pulled high, the flags 
are successively released from FLAG1 to FLAG3 after 
individual 
programmable 
delay 
time. 
Then 
the 
connected power supplies power up. When the EN pin 
is pulled low, the flags output low with a reverse 
sequence from FLAG3 to FLAG1 after individual 
programmable 
delay 
time. 
The 
delay 
time 
is 
programmed by connecting a capacitor between the 
TADJ pin and ground. The logic of the output flags can 
be inverted by the user. 
The SGM822 is available in Green MSOP-8 and 
UTDFN-1.5×1.5-8L packages. It operates over an 
ambient temperature range of -40℃ to +125℃.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
The SGM822 multivoltage power sequencer provides 
power-up and power-down control for up to three power 
supplies. Three output flags are connected to the 
enable or shutdown pins of the power supplies to 
control the operation. The delay time between each flag 
signals is programmed by the TADJ capacitor. These 
functions allow users to design a complex power 
system without the concern of large inrush currents or 
latch-up conditions that may cause the system 
abnormality or even damaged. The user can use the 
invert (INV) pin to reverse the logic of the flag outputs. 
The INV pin is not allowed to be floating. The following 
discussion assumes INV is held low so that the flag 
output is active high. 
 
Adjustable Timing 
An external timing capacitor is connected between the 
TADJ pin and ground that establishes the clock 
waveform. The SGM822 linearly charges or discharges 
this capacitor by a fixed current source/sink, denoted 
ITADJ_SRC/ITADJ_SNK, 
of 
magnitude 
11µA 
between 
predefined threshold voltage levels, denoted VHTH and 
VLTH. Figure 4 shows the timing waveform. Once the 
capacitor voltage drops to VLTH, the chip reverses to 
charge again. With this method, the clock cycle is 
generated. 
tCLK
TADJ
High Threshold Level,
VHTH = 1.2V
Low Threshold Level,
VLTH = 0.5V
 
 
Figure 4. TADJ Pin Timing Waveform 
 
The clock cycle period is directly proportional to the 
timing capacitor value. Considering the TADJ threshold 
voltage levels and the charge/discharge current 
magnitude, it can be shown that the timing capacitor- 
clock period relationship is typically 130µs/nF. For 
example, a 10nF capacitor sets up a clock period of 
1.3ms. 
The flag outputs are controlled by the enable (EN) pin. 
After power-on, all the flags are held low until the 
precision EN voltage exceeds its threshold. After EN is 
asserted, the open-drain flags will be sequentially 
released. 
The first flag (FLAG1) is released after a fixed time 
period, denoted tD1 in Figure 5. This corresponds to 
least nine, maximum ten, clock cycles depending on 
where EN is asserted relative to the clock signal. After 
the release of the first flag, another timing procedure 
will begin to delay the release of the second flag 
(FLAG2). This timing procedure simultaneously begins 
when the timing capacitor starts charging. As a result, 
the delay time, denoted tD2, corresponds to exactly 
eight clock periods. Similarly, FLAG3 is released after 
the delay time, denoted tD3, again eight clock cycles, 
has expired. A 10nF TADJ capacitor generates typical 
delay time tD2 and tD3 of 10.4ms and tD1 of from 11.7ms 
to 13ms. 
The power-down sequence is the same as power-up, 
but in reverse order. When EN is pulled low, the third 
flag (FLAG3) is pulled low after the delay time, denoted 
tD4, has expired. The second and first flags will then 
follow in a sequential manner after the corresponding 
delay time. The delay time, denoted tD4, tD5, tD6, is equal 
to tD1, tD2, tD3, respectively. 
For robustness, the internal pull-down FET of each flag 
is designed to limit the sink current level so that it can 
sustain a short circuit to VCC for a short period.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Enable Circuit 
The enable circuit is designed with an internal 
comparator, an accurate bandgap voltage (1.2V, TYP), 
to provide a precision enable threshold. With this 
precision enable function, the user can use an external 
capacitor to set the timing as shown in Figure 9.

Alternatively, sequencing can be based on a certain 
event. For example, connect the power supply of 
SGM822 to EN pin through a resistor divider, as shown 
in Figure 11. After the VCC voltage exceeds the 
threshold voltage, the sequencing begins to execute. 
When calculating the VCC threshold voltage that 
triggers the sequencing event, take care of the effects 
of the internal EN pull-up current source. The supply 
voltage for which EN is asserted is given by:

The EN pin provides the glitch-free feature to make the 
system robust. The timer will start counting at the EN 
rising edge, but will always reset if EN is pulled low 
before FLAG1 is released. This is illustrated in Figure 
12 with INV low.

If EN is pulled low before the complete power-up 
sequence, the SGM822 will enter a controlled 
shutdown. Figure 13 describes the flag sequence if EN 
is pulled low after FLAG1 releases, but before the 
entire power-up sequence is completed. INV is 
assumed low.

The Sequencing with EN Pin Control 
The timing sequence of the SGM822 is controlled by 
the enable (EN) pin. After power-on, all the flags are 
held low until the precision EN pin is pulled high. After 
EN is pulled high, the power-up sequence begins to 
execute. 
When EN is pulled low, the power-down sequence will 
execute. After the third flag (FLAG3) corresponding 
delay time expires, FLAG3 is pulled low. The second 
and first flags will then be pulled low after their 
appropriate delays. 
 
INV Pin Setting the Logic Output 
When the INV pin is tied to a logic low, the flag output is 
active high. When the INV pin is tied to a logic high, the 
flag output is active low.

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
Pulling up Flag Pins to Independent Power 
Supply 
The SGM822 contains three open-drain output flags 
which need external pulled-up resistors, for example 
100kΩ pull-up resistors. This part is designed to protect 
the flag output pins from damaging if these pins are 
shorted to VCC for a short period. 
For some application scenarios, the flag output voltage 
needs to be different from the VCC voltage. The 
separate flag power supply is used to pull up the 
open-drain outputs. With this method, each flag is 
pulled high to the required level of the controlled power 
supplies. The user must make sure the flag supply 
voltage is within the recommended operating range. 
 
Design Example 
In this example, the SGM822 is used to implement a 
power-up (1 - 2 - 3) and power-down (3 - 2 - 1) sequence 
of three power supplies. 
 
Design Requirements 
For this design example, use the parameters listed in 
Table 1. 
Design Procedure 
A timing capacitor of CADJ = 10nF generates typical delay 
time tD2 and tD3 of 10.4ms and tD1 of between 11.7ms 
and 13ms. Connect the INV pin to GND so that the 
output flags are active high. See Adjustable Timing for 
calculating the value for CADJ.

LAYOUT GUIDELINES 
An input capacitor is not necessary but recommended 
to avoid the possible noise effect which might be 
present on the VCC pin. A 0.1μF ceramic capacitor 
may be placed as close as possible to the VCC pin. 
Connect pull-up resistors between the flag output pins 
and a positive input supply (VCC or an independent 
flag supply). Minimal trace length is recommended to 
avoid the unexpected noise from the environment. A 
typical value for the pull-up resistors is 100kΩ.
