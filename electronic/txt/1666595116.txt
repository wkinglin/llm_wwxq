GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM40560 is designed for the monolithic circuit 
with 
high-precision 
linear 
constant-current, 
and 
constant-voltage charging, which is specifically for 
small capacity Li-Ion/polymer Li-Ion secondary battery. 
It can complete the whole processes of pre-charge, 
fast-charge, trickle floating charge, voltage fold-back 
holding, resistive voltage drop compensation and 
recharge stand-alone. The maximum charge voltage is 
fixed with five options: 
SGM40560-3.65 corresponds to 3.65V/3.709V/4.547V 
SGM40560-4.05 corresponds to 4.05V/4.108V/5.045V 
SGM40560-4.2 corresponds to 4.2V/4.257V/5.235V 
SGM40560-4.3 corresponds to 4.3V/4.356V/5.363V 
SGM40560-4.4 corresponds to 4.4V/4.466V/5.484V 
The charge current is set with the external resistor. The 
slow blinking LED indicates charging in progress and 
the continuous shining LED within a certain time 
indicates charging completion, which can be charged 
even 
with 
weak energy. It can operate 
with 
constant-voltage power supply, additionally, depending 
on its features and control structure. It can charge for 
the loose coupling coil with large voltage fluctuations 
and it also works for the solar batteries with reverse 
current. Therefore, it can provide flexible power supply 
options for wearable devices and mini portable devices. 
It has the voltage fold-back holding function and 
thermal current limit function so that the external power 
source can be used to supply power to the load for a 
long time safely and stably. 
The SGM40560 is available in Green TDFN-2×2-6AL 
and SOIC-8 (Exposed Pad) packages and is rated over 
the -40℃ to +125℃ temperature range.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

VIN 
P 
Power Input Pin. It is recommended to use a 1μF (or larger value) X5R 
ceramic capacitor from VIN pin to ground to get good power supply 
decoupling. This ceramic capacitor should be placed as close as 
possible to VIN pin. 
2

nCHG 
O 
Charge Status Indication. Period T = 1280ms when the battery is 
charging, this pin sinks current intermittently in T/8. When charging is 
complete, this pin sinks current continuously for 40 indication cycles, 
that is 51.2s, then the nCHG is high impedance. 
3

GND 
G 
Ground. 
‒ 
4, 5 
NC

IREF 
I/O 
Maximum Charge Current Setting and Prohibiting Charging Control 
Pin. Connect a resistor between IREF and GND pins to set the 
maximum charge current according to the following formula: 
ICHG ≤ 400mA:

R
 
where RIREF is in kΩ. The resistor should be placed as close to this pin 
as possible. When disabled, VIREF = 0V. When this pin is pulled higher 
than 1.6V, the charging function is prohibited. 
5 
7 
F 
I/O 
Charge Voltage Setting and EDLC Capacitor Intermediate Voltage 
Balance Pin. When the battery is charging and VBAT > 2.0V, it starts to 
detect the external connection of this pin. 
Take SGM40560-4.3 for example: When the pin is ground level, the 
maximum charge voltage is set to 4.3V. When the pin is BAT level, the 
maximum charge voltage is set to 4.356V. When the pin is floating or 
near to the half of BAT level, the maximum charge voltage is set to 
5.363V, and this pin is transformed into the half of BAT level. When the 
voltage of F pin deviates from 50% × VBAT, it starts to source current or 
sink current to make a regulation. 
6 
8 
BAT 
P 
Charger Output Pin. Connect the pin to the battery or battery & load. It 
is recommended to connect a 1μF (or larger value) X5R ceramic 
capacitor. 
Exposed Pad 
Exposed Pad 
GND 
IC 
Exposed Pad. Exposed pad is internally connected to GND. Connect it 
to a large ground plane to maximize thermal performance. It is not 
intended as an electrical connection point. 
 
NOTE: 1. I = Input, O = Output, IO = Input/Output, G = Ground, P = Power for the Circuit, IC = Reserving for Internal Connection, 
NC = Not Connect.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
The SGM40560 charging process is designed to improve the 
small battery application based on the traditional constant- 
current and constant-voltage charging process. It can satisfy 
the requirement of current accuracy for small capacity battery. 
Besides, it is also suitable for external power supply which is 
continuous but unstable, and it can support fast charge safely 
with continuous load. Therefore, it can cooperate with 
low-cost loose coupling coils to achieve wireless charging, 
and it can employ solar cells to supplement power. 
The SGM40560 has the functions of pre-charge, fast-charge, 
trickle floating charge, voltage fold-back holding, resistive 
voltage drop compensation, recharge and so on. The 
maximum charging current ICHG is set with the external resistor 
RIREF. When the output voltage is lower than 60% of the 
maximum charging voltage, 7.5% × ICHG current is used for 
pre-charge. Then fast-charge with the set value ICHG until 
the output voltage is greater than 98.5% of the maximum 
charging voltage and exceeds 44 minutes, or after the 
charging current is less than 20% × ICHG (this condition is 
used as the full-charge judgment condition). After that, it 
goes into output voltage fold-back holding state of the 
constant-voltage function, and this voltage is lower than 4% 
of the maximum charging voltage. After the output voltage 
fold-back holding function is completed, if the output voltage 
drops more than 2.2% of the maximum charging voltage, the 
resistive voltage drop compensation is performed, and the 
output voltage is further increased by 2%. If the drop is less 
than 2.2% of the maximum charging voltage, the output 
voltage is maintained. When the output voltage continues to 
reduce more than 1.5%, the voltage fold-back holding state 
is exited, and a charging process is restarted. 
When F is floating and the full-charge judgment condition is 
satisfied, the output voltage fold-back holding state does not 
start, and the maximum charging voltage is maintained as the 
output. 
The SGM40560 charges the battery in two paths, one is the 
power transistor and the other is the Schottky diode. When 
power-on, the diode is preferred to charge the battery. When 
the dropout voltage between input and output is greater than 
VDH, the diode is disconnected, switching to the power 
transistor to charge the battery. When the dropout voltage 
between input and output is lower than VDL, the power 
transistor is disconnected and the diode is charging the 
battery again. The current charged by the diode is determined 
by the input and output voltage difference. The charge current 
of the power transistor is set by the RIREF. When the diode is 
charging, the SGM40560 has a low quiescent current (about 
15μA), which is very suitable for a weak energy supply 
system like a solar cell. 
When it is detected that the output voltage reaches 98.5% of 
the maximum charging voltage, the power transistor charging 
with the constant-voltage function is forced, which can 
prevent the battery from being overcharged. 
When the SGM40560 starts charging, it will be charged with 
the set ICHG for a certain time, about 20ms, using to activate 
the battery. The SGM40560 has internal UVLO function, and 
the threshold voltage is 2.4V, the hysteresis is 200mV. 
However, when the input voltage is lower than 2.2V, it will not 
stop charging immediately, but wait for an indication period to 
operate, which can maintain the stability of the charging 
current effectively. 
The SGM40560 relies on great thermal contact and heat 
dissipation with the board. When the temperature of the 
device is higher than +130℃, the charging current is actively 
reduced to prevent overheating damage. With the small 
device, the heat dissipation capability of the device and the 
degree of heat tolerance of the specific application scenario 
will determine the maximum power dissipation of the 
SGM40560. 
The design choice of charging current requires a combination 
of battery capacity and load characteristics of the input supply. 
The maximum charging voltage needs to be selected with 
reference to the voltage specification of the battery or mass 
capacitor. Determine the connection of pin F according to the 
selection. The relationship between the connection of F and 
the maximum charging voltage can be found in the Device 
Selection Table section. 
When F is floating or close to the half of the BAT voltage, the 
output is the half of the BAT. When it deviates from 50% × 
VBAT, it has a source/sink current capability of about 55mA.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Motion Design after Full-Charge 
If the external power supply exists after charging, the 
SGM40560 will change to maintain the output voltage in the 
voltage 
fold-back 
holding 
state, 
and 
release 
the 
constant-current limitation and supply the load system 
continuously. The output voltage at voltage fold-back holding 
state is lower than 4% of the maximum charging voltage, and 
maintaining at voltage fold-back holding state does not affect 
the cycle life of the battery. This design avoids the rapid aging 
caused by the highest voltage for a long time and the normal 
aging of continuous alternating charge and discharge, which 
also maintains the battery close to the saturation capacity. 
When the external power supply cannot maintain the holding 
voltage, the output voltage is lower than 98.5% of the holding 
voltage or more than one indication period occurs, exit the 
voltage fold-back holding state and restart the charging 
process. 
 
Resistive Voltage Drop Compensation  
After the SGM40560 detects that the full-charge judgment 
condition is met, the device stops charging and check the 
output voltage change. If the output voltage does not drop 
2.2%, the judgment of the full state will be maintained, and 
the output will be maintained by the fold-back holding voltage, 
otherwise, the compensation will be started, the output 
voltage will be increased by about 2%, recharge again as the 
maximum charging voltage. The voltage drop is only detected 
for a certain period of time, and is only compensated once, 
and finally the output is maintained with the fold-back holding 
voltage. 
 
Loose Coupling Charging 
The SGM40560 is designed to charge when the input voltage 
is slightly above the battery voltage and close to its highest 
withstand voltage, and it does not require constant and stable 
supply of current and voltage. When using a power supply 
with limited output capability, the IREF pin can be connected 
to GND, so that the SGM40560 is in a saturated conduction 
state during charging operation, maximizing the power supply 
capability and the current passing capability of the 
SGM40560. This saturation conduction state still has the 
function of preventing overcharging of the battery, that is, 
after approaching the maximum charging voltage of 98.5%, it 
enters constant-voltage charging. 
Small Capacity Battery Charging 
For small-capacity batteries (such as EDLC capacitors), the 
charging current is small, and the load current accounts for a 
large proportion of the charging current. After entering the 
floating charge, there is still a large charging current, which 
will cause a voltage drop in the equivalent series resistance of 
the charging path, leading to the battery terminal voltage to 
be lower than the BAT pin voltage. The SGM40560 
automatically detects this resistive voltage drop. If the 
resistive voltage drop exceeds 2.2%, the maximum charge 
voltage will be increased accordingly. 
From the Figure 1, the charging current of the SGM40560 is 
set by the resistor RIREF. If it needs to externally control the 
charging current, refer to Figure 6, use the controller's IO to 
generate two different current settings (such as the left circuit), 
or use PWM to synthesize a voltage applied to one end of the 
current setting resistor for detailed control.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Battery Types for Different Voltages 
After selecting the different suffix models, the SGM40560 
further selects different voltage trimming ranges through 
different connections to the F pin, which can adapt to the 
charging voltage of most common batteries. The full output 
voltage fold-back holding further ensures safety and 
long-term efficiency. 
The SGM40560 is designed to charge the battery string and 
equalize the voltage across the battery when used in a 
two-series application of a lower single-voltage lithium 
titanate battery and an EDLC capacitor. Equilibrium is only 
performed during the charging process, after reaching 
equilibrium, the current consumption of the battery is about 
4μA. The equalization circuit does not consume power when 
there is no charging power. 
The nickel-hydrogen battery allows the self-discharge to 
increase when the floating voltage is increased, and the 
floating charge achieves a voltage balance by self-discharge. 
The SGM40560 does not have the ability to balance Ni-MH 
battery strings. When charging Ni-MH batteries, select a 
suitable voltage type suffix according to the voltage of 2 or 3 
series connected and use F pin to connect and fine-tune.  
 
Light Indicator Load Design 
Referring to the schematic diagram of the portion of Figure 3, 
the SGM40560 outputs (sinks) a constant-current with a duty 
ratio of 1/8 during charging, and continuously outputs 40 
indication periods after being fully charged. With its 2.3mA 
constant-current output, it can adapt to the weak external 
power supply. When using IO to read the charge state, the 
capacitor can be directly connected in parallel with nCHG, 
and the capacitor can be kept in the output state during the 
period when nCHG is not driven (high impedance), which is 
convenient for reading. 
 
Parallel Expansion of Charging Current 
and Saturation Conduction Charging 
Using multiple SGM40560s in parallel can increase the 
charging 
current. 
Multiple 
SGM40560 
dispersion 
arrangements increase the heat dissipation area. When 
connected in parallel, each chip is configured with RIREF. 
Select any one of the chips to configure the RIREF to be 
slightly smaller. The charging current will be slightly larger 
than other chips (take a small 9% as an example, the 
charging current is 10% larger), then the chip is detected 
lagging behind the other chips, so the nCHG of the chip can 
be used as a global indication output. 
When a source of limited power is used to charge a battery 
with a larger capacity relative to the source, the current 
supply capability of the source tends to be lower than the safe 
charging current of the battery. For example, a solar panel 
with a maximum power of 5W-10 strings has a maximum 
output capacity of 1.2A-4V, and a safe current of less than 
1.8Ah in 0.7C. At this time, the charging current is set 
according to the safe current of the battery. During the 
constant-current charging, the SGM40560 will be in a 
saturated conduction state, and the SGM40560 will start to 
control the charging current only when the battery voltage is 
near full. The charging current in this state is limited by the 
source's own capability. The consumption of the SGM40560 
insertion is determined by its on-resistance, which can 
effectively utilize the source's capability.  
 
Matching Energy Storage Capacitors to 
Improve the Impact of Sudden Load 
The constant-voltage/constant-current control capability of 
the SGM40560 can be used to isolate the impact of sudden 
load on small-capacity batteries or fragile power systems, 
such as isolated NB-IoT and GPRS transmission bursts to 
prevent system power failure. When the load is burst, it is 
powered by the storage capacitor. The charging voltage of 
the SGM40560 is set to a higher voltage that the system can 
withstand, and the charging current is set to a level suitable 
for the power supply characteristics.
