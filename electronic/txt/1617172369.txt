GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM41524A/SGM41524B is compact and efficient 
Lithium-ion or Lithium-ion polymer (Li+/polymer) battery 
charger. It can provide power and charge the single-cell 
battery of a system typically found in compact portable 
device. An internal switching buck converter regulates 
the supply input for charging the battery and powering 
the system even if the battery is absent. The converter 
can also operate as a simple pass-through switch with 
no switching if the load and input voltages are close. 
A typical application circuit is shown in Figure 2. The 
SGM41524A/SGM41524B features resistor programmable 
constant-current and constant-voltage charging capability 
plus a charge limiting timer and operates in compliance 
with the BAJ/JEITA safety guide. An NTC (β = 3950K) 
can be used for battery temperature sensing on top of 
the internal junction temperature monitoring. The IND 
status output pin can be connected to LEDs to indicate 
the operating conditions, such as power input ok (POK), 
in charging (CHG), VIN over-voltage (POK and CHG 
alternate blinking) and no power/disabled (OFF). 
Voltage fold-back on the output is provided to power the 
system from the input while retaining battery charge 
and 
preventing 
overcharge. 
Input 
under-voltage 
regulation is implemented by reducing the load current 
such that VIN stays above a minimum when the source 
is weak. Similarly, the die temperature can be regulated 
and limited by reducing output power to avoid device or 
the circuit board being overheated. 
These features simplify the system design and ensure 
safe and reliable operation as well as improved user 
experience. 
The SGM41524A/SGM41524B is delivered in a Green 
TDFN-2×3-8BL package. The device operates in -40℃ 
to +85℃ with +115℃ thermal regulation.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

is 
a 
general 
purpose 
stand-alone switch mode charger device designed for 
powering systems using Li+/polymer rechargeable batteries. 
Several features are provided including charge voltage and 
current programming and status indication. Input voltage and 
die temperature are constantly monitored to prevent output 
power failure. If the input supply voltage drops too low, the 
device reduces the output power to reduce loading on the 
input and prevent further drop and power failure. Similarly, if 
the junction is overheated by heavy load, the output power is 
reduced to prevent thermal shutdown and system power 
failure. It is also capable for various charging modes like 
constant-current, constant-voltage, constant-current pre- 
charging, and trickle charging (when input source is weak). 
This device does not have a separate battery switch to 
connect or disconnect the battery from the system (load). 
However, it uses voltage fold-back retaining for battery safety 
and lifetime extension when the battery is fully charged and 
input power is present. With this method, battery energy loss 
is lower because there is no switch in the discharge path. The 
only disadvantage is that if the battery voltage is excessively 
low, then start the system instantly is not possible because 
charge path cannot be separated and it may take a few 
minutes to charge the battery and reach to an adequate 
voltage level to start the load system. 
 
Power-Up with Low/No Battery 
If the battery is not attached or its voltage is less than 60% of 
VCHG (VVBAT < 0.6VCHG), the device feeds the VBAT with a 
current limited to less than 300mA for about 5ms to 
pre-charge the battery and system load before it goes into 
battery pre-conditioning charging state. This pre-charge 
period can increase the voltage of a 500μF capacitor 
(between VBAT and GND) for up to 3V before the device 
starts to deliver the lower pre-conditioning charge current 
(97mA TYP). 
If the load is started before fast charge phase, the supply 
capacity will be limited to the pre-conditioning charge current 
for a relatively long time. The initial 5ms pre-charge period 
can quickly bring the device to the fast charge or even 
fold-back phase when there is no battery attached and 
provide enough power for the system operation in a short 
time. 
 
Charging Profile and Fold-Back Retaining 
The charging profile is shown in Figure 1. When the battery 
voltage is less than 0.6VCHG, the output current is regulated to 
a low and safe pre-conditioning level (IPRE). On the other hand 
when the input supply is present and charge is complete, the 
output goes to the safe voltage fold-back mode for powering 
the load. In this mode, the output current is limited to less 
than peak current limit (IPEAK) and not to the programmed 
charge current limit. Figure 5 shows the load transient 
response of the evaluation board circuit whose charge current 
is programmed for less than the load current.

Figure 5. Load Transient Response in Fold-Back Supply 
 
The input voltage is monitored during charging. If the source 
is weak and cannot maintain its voltage under heavy load, the 
charging current is reduced to avoid system power collapse 
due to input voltage drop. 
The charge is considered full if the battery voltage exceeds 
the floating charge timer start threshold (VFLT) and the charge 
current drops below the charge termination current (IRES) or if 
the floating charge timer runs out of time (tFCOT).  
When the full charge status is detected, the output will drop to 
the fold-back voltage specified by fold-back retaining output 
voltage ratio (FR ratio is typically 97.1% of VCHG as specified 
in the EC table) and converter continues to work but indicator 
shows "not charging". If the battery voltage is higher than 
fold-back level, the switching will stop. VBAT is monitored 
periodically and if it drops below that level the buck converter 
starts to operate and regulate the output to the fold-back level.  
The full charge state is continued until the input power is 
recycled or if the battery voltage drops below the recharge 
threshold (VRR). 
If the voltage drop between the input and output (VDROP) is 
small and less than VDROPm, the device goes into forward 
diode state and stops switching. Switching is resumed if the 
VDROP exceeds VDROPM level. The CHG indication will turn off 
if the time of VDROP < VDROPm is longer than the retaining time 
(tRET).

FUNCTION DESCRIPTION AND APPLICATION (continued) 
Charge Current Programming and Turn-Off 
Charge current is programmed by RCCSET resistance by 
RCCSET = K/ICC where the K is charge current setting ratio 
which is typically 10000V as specified in the EC table. 
Pulling the CC pin to a voltage level higher than VINH turns the 
device off (disabled). When this pin is released the device 
resumes the status before being inhibited. 
 
Charge Voltage Programming 
Charging voltage can be programmed in one of the 7 preset 
values by setting a voltage on CV pin. A 50μA current source 
is internally connected to CV pin. Programming can be done 
by directly applying a voltage to the CV pin, or by connecting 
a resistor to GND that results in the same voltage as shown in 
Table 1.

BAJ/JEITA Charging Extending and Safety 
This device implements the battery temperature related 
charging control in compliance with the BAJ/JEITA guide on 
safe use of secondary Lithium-ion batteries. An NTC (β = 
3950K) can be used as shown in Figure 2 (or Figure 3) for 
battery temperature sensing. 
As specified in Table 2 and Table 3, the charging voltage and 
current are reduced when the sensed battery temperature is 
out of the preferred charging range (10℃ to 45℃). When the 
temperature is too high (above 55℃ for SGM41524A and 
above 45℃ for SGM41524B) or too low (less than 0℃), the 
device stops charging.

NOTE: The VCHG and the ICC (charging voltage and current)

If NTC feature is not used, connect the NTC pin to ground. 
The device checks for grounded NTC pin once during the 
start-up when the input voltage is exceeding 2.7V. 
 
Indication and Status Reading 
The IND output can have 4 states to show different conditions: 
(1) Low (sink current) to indicate the input power is available 
(or not charging); (2) High (source current) to indicate the 
device is in charging; (3) Hi-Z (open) for indicating no power 
is available (when VVIN < VCHGm) or when it is turned off by 
pulling the CC pin voltage up; and (4) blinking or alternatingly 
Low and High (sinking and sourcing current) if an input 
over-voltage occurs. IND voltage can be used as a signal for 
the host or other circuit for status detection. 
Note that in the high impedance state (Hi-Z), the POK LED 
and CHG LED are forward biased by the input voltage (all in 
series) and they can turn on depending on the drive current 
determined by the LED forward voltages and series 
resistances.

FUNCTION DESCRIPTION AND APPLICATION (continued) 
Input Voltage Regulation and Thermal 
Regulation 
To prevent power shutdown, the output current is gradually 
reduced if VIN drops close to the minimum (VCHGm). Output 
current eventually reaches to zero when VIN falls to VCHGm 
level. Similarly, if the junction temperature increases close to 
its maximum (TOTR), the output current is progressively 
reduced and will reach to zero when the temperature reaches 
to TOTR.  
 
Component Selection 
Inductor Selection 
Small inductors and capacitors can be chosen thanks to the 
high operating switching frequency of the 1.34MHz. Select an 
inductor with a saturation current a little bit higher than the 
charging current (ICHG) plus half the ripple current peak to 
peak magnitude (IRIPPLE): 
 
ISAT ≥ ICHG + (1/2) IRIPPLE 
(1) 
The inductor ripple current depends on the input voltage 
(VVBUS), the duty cycle (D = VVBAT/VVBUS), the switching 
frequency (fS) and the inductance (L). In CCM (e.g. full load):

(2) 
The maximum inductor ripple current occurs when the duty 
cycle (D) is 0.5 or near. Typically, the inductor ripple is 
designed in the range between 20% and 40% of the 
maximum charging current as a trade-off between inductor 
size and efficiency. Smaller inductor results in higher ripple 
(AC) current flowing into the capacitor and switches and can 
reduce efficiency. 
 
Input Capacitor 
Choose the input capacitance with enough RMS current 
rating to decouple input switching AC currents away from 
input. Low ESR ceramic capacitor such as X5R or X7R is 
preferred for input decoupling. Typically, 10μF capacitance is 
suitable for 1A to 2A charging current. Keep the capacitor(s) 
close to VIN and GND pins to minimize the parasitic 
inductance in the input ripple current circulation path. In the 
worst-case, the RMS of the ripple current is half of the DC 
charging current (ICHG) when duty cycle is D = 50%. If the 
converter does not operate at 50% duty cycle, then the 
worst-case occurs when duty cycle is closest to 50%. The 
input RMS current (ICIN) can be estimated by Equation 3.

Output Capacitor 
A few factors must be considered to design the output 
capacitance. First, the SGM41524A/B has the internal loop 
compensation for the buck converter that is optimized for 
ceramic output capacitance larger than 10μF. The output 
capacitor (COUT) circulates the output ripple current and 
prevents it from going into the battery. Having AC current in 
the battery results in extra heating and lower lifetime.  
Equation 4 gives the output capacitor RMS current ICOUT 
when no battery is attached.

(5) 
The capacitance should be selected large enough for meeting 
the system requirement for acceptable VRPPLE. 
In the system design, operation with no battery must be 
considered carefully. Typically, the presence of the battery 
helps in filtering of the sags and ripples and provides peak 
energy demands when load surges occur. When the battery 
is absent, a relatively large capacitor is needed to have 
proper performance. 
Besides the VRIPPLE requirement, the load starting inrush 
current is another factor to consider for output capacitor 
selection. If at the beginning the device turns into fold-back, 
the converter does not start switching as the output capacitor 
holds the voltage higher than the fold-back retaining voltage. 
VBAT voltage is monitored periodically and as long as it is 
above fold-back voltage, it is only the output capacitor that 
powers the system in the absence of the battery. The 
capacitance should be large enough to maintain the VBAT 
voltage and prevent dropping below minimum system 
requirement before the switching fold-back mode supply 
operation starts. The capacitance for fulfilling this requirement 
is highly dependent on how the load starts, including its timing, 
start current and acceptable voltage drop. Verification with a 
prototype is recommended if operation without a battery is 
considered.

Layout Guide 
1. Place VIN capacitor close to the VIN pin and GND pin. 
2. Place the inductor terminal close to the SW pin and 
minimize the copper area of switching node trace. Do not use 
multiple layers for this connection. 
3. Minimize the return loop area and ripple current path length 
through the inductor and the output capacitor(s) to the device 
GND pin. 
4．Use copper plane for power GND and place multiple via 
between top and bottom GND plane for better heat 
dissipation and noise immunity.
