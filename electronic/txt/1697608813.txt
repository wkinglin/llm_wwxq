JULY 2023 – REV. A. 1 
GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM48534A, SGM48534B, SGM48535A, and 
SGM48535B 
are 
single-channel 
low-side 
power 
transistor gate drivers. Inputs are compatible with 
standard CMOS or LSTTL signals. The output is 
capable of delivering 2.6A sink and 4.2A source peak 
currents. 
The 
SGM4853XA/B 
have 
over-current 
protection functions. The OCP pin detects the 
over-current signal, and the EN/nFLT pin outputs the 
over-current status. Once the over-current protection is 
triggered, the fault pin is pulled down internally and 
outputs a low level. The EN/nFLT pin requires an 
external pull-up circuit to ensure the normal operation 
of the driver. The EN/nFLT pin can also be used as an 
enable pin for the driver. Pulling the EN/nFLT pin low 
can disable the driver. The driver has under-voltage 
protection function, and the output remains low when 
the VCC voltage is lower than the operating voltage. 
The SGM4853XA/B are all available in a Green 
SOT-23-6 package.

ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can caμse damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more sμsceptible to damage 
becaμse even small parametric changes could caμse the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

2. Used as a fault report pin: when an over-current or under-voltage lockout 
event occurs, the pin outputs a low level. The pin needs to configure external 
pull-up resistor and capacitor. The resistor and capacitor determine the fault 
clear time.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
Low-side Single Channel Gate Driver 
The SGM4853XA/B drivers are used to drive power 
transistors, including MOSFETs and IGBTs. Figure 4 is 
a path diagram of a source current. Figure 5 is a path 
diagram of a sink current. IO is defined as the output 
current of the gate driver. VOUT is defined as the output 
voltage of the gate driver. 
 
Propagation Delay and Switching Time 
Figure 6 shows the relationship between the input 
signal and output signal of the SGM4853XA/B. It 
defines the measurement method of time parameters 
tON, tOFF, tR and tF. 
Input Stage 
The input pins of the SGM4853XA/B drivers are based 
on TTL/CMOS compatible input-threshold logic. With 
2.1V (TYP) high threshold and 1.0V (TYP) low 
threshold, 
the 
logic-level 
thresholds 
can 
be 
conveniently driven with PWM control signals derived 
from 3.3V and 5V digital-power controllers. Wide 
hysteresis (1.1V, TYP) provides improved noise 
immunity. The input pin has an internal pull-down 
resistor to ensure that the drive output is low even if the 
input is floating. Figure 7 shows the relationship 
between the input signal threshold and IC logic.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
VCC and Under-Voltage Lockout (UVLO) 
The SGM4853XA/B drivers integrate under-voltage 
protection on the VCC supply-circuit blocks. When the 
VCC bias voltage falls below Vccuv- and the UVLO 
duration is greater than tVCCUV, the UVLO protection is 
triggered and the output remains low, ignoring the input 
status. 
After UVLO is triggered, the internal switch QFLT is 
turned on, and EN/nFLT is pulled low to COM. When 
the UVLO state is removed, QFLT is turned off and the 
voltage on the EN/nFLT pin is charged by the external 
pull-up circuit, which is slowly rising. The fault clear 
time, tFLTC, depends on the time constant that is set by 
RFLTC and CFLTC. 
When the driver exits the UVLO state, the output 
remains low until the next high signal appears on the IN 
pin. See Figure 8 for more details. 
The UVLO filtering time, tVCCUV, helps to improve the 
noise immunity on the UVLO circuit. 
 
Over-Current Detection Function 
The SGM4853XA/B drivers implement the over-current 
protection function via the OCP pin. The pin voltage will 
trigger the protection mechanism when the voltage 
exceeds VOCTH. The system connects the voltage drop 
on the current detection resistor to the OCP pin. The 
OCP pin is capable of withstanding negative 10V DC 
voltage. Figure 9 is a typical schematic of the 
SGM4853XA. 
In 
order 
to 
prevent 
the 
OCP 
function 
from 
malfunctioning due to the noise caused by the fast 
switching process of the power device, the detection 
response time tOCPFLT is set. The external RC filter 
circuit of the OCP pin will increase the response time of 
the over-current detection protection, and it is used in 
very harsh environments. When the OCP pin voltage 
exceeds VOCTH and the time exceeds tOCPFLT, the 
SGM4853XA/B drivers internally trigger OCP function. 
Simultaneously, QFLT is turned on and EN/nFLT is 
pulled low to COM. 
When the OCP pin voltage exceeds VOCTH, the gate 
output of the SGM4853XA/B is pulled low at once after 
the internal delay, tOCPDEL, expires. See Figure 10. 
When the driver exits OCP fault event, the output 
remains low until the next high signal appears on the IN 
pin.

Fault Report Function and Setting 
The SGM4853XA/B drivers provide a fault report 
function, and the fault status is reported by the 
EN/nFLT pin. An under-voltage of VCC and an 
over-current event can cause the driver to indicate a 
fault. In the event of a fault, QFLT is turned on and 
EN/nFLT is pulled low to COM. The EN/nFLT output 
remains low until the fault condition is cleared. After the 
driver exits the fault event, QFLT is turned off and the 
voltage on the EN/nFLT pin is charged by the external 
pull-up circuit. The charging time constant is controlled 
by RFLTC and CFLTC. The fault clearing time tFLTC 
depends on the exponential charging characteristic of 
the capacitor. 
Figure 9 shows a typical circuit for the EN/nFLT pin. 
RFLTC is pulled up to the external power supply (VDD). 
CFLTC capacitor is connected from the EN/nFLT pin to 
COM pin. 
Assuming VDD = 3.3V, the fault clearing time tFLTC can 
be calculated by the following equation:

Enable Function 
The EN/nFLT pin also offers enable function. This pin 
can control the output of the drive. When the EN/nFLT 
voltage rises above VENH, the output is enabled. When 
the EN/nFLT pin voltage falls below VENL, the output is 
disabled. 
Figure 11 to Figure 13 show the timing diagrams of the 
SGM4853XA/B, and the relationship between enable 
signal threshold and IC logic.
