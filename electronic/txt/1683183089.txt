GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM836 family can monitor system voltages from 
0.4V to 5V. When the detection voltage falls below the 
preset threshold (VITL) or the manual reset (nMR) pin is 
driven low, the open-drain nRESET output is asserted. 
After the detection voltage and nMR voltage return 
higher than their respective thresholds, the nRESET 
output remains low within the user-adjustable delay 
time. 
The SGM836 uses a precision reference to achieve 1% 
threshold accuracy. The fixed reset timeout period can 
be set to 20ms by leaving the CT pin open and can be 
set to 300ms by connecting the CT pin to VDD through a 
resistor. The programmable reset timeout period can be 
set from 1.25ms to 10s through an external capacitor 
connected to the CT pin. Low quiescent current makes 
the 
SGM836 
very 
suitable 
for 
battery-powered 
applications. 
The SGM836 is available in Green SOT-23-6 and 
TDFN-2×2-6AL packages.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
When the SENSE voltage falls below VITL or the nMR 
pin is driven low, the open-drain nRESET output is 
asserted. After the SENSE and nMR voltages exceed 
their respective thresholds, the nRESET output 
remains low within the user-adjustable delay time. 
 
Feature Description 
The SGM836 device has a reset delay time adjustment 
function and a wide range of detection thresholds, so it 
can be widely used in various applications. The 
detection threshold voltages are factory-set from 0.9V 
to 5V, while the SGM836-ADJ detection threshold 
voltages must be set above 0.405V through an external 
resistance divider. The fixed 20ms reset timeout period 
can be set by leaving the CT pin open, and it also can 
be set to 300ms by connecting the CT pin to VDD 
through a resistor. The reset timeout period can be set 
from 1.25ms to 10s through programming an external 
capacitor which is connected to the CT pin. 
 
SENSE Input 
The SENSE pin is dedicated for voltage monitor. The 
nRESET will be asserted if the SENSE voltage falls 
below VITL. The internal comparator has built-in hysteresis 
to ensure smooth nRESET. It is recommended to 
connect a bypass capacitor from 1nF to 10nF at the 
SENSE pin to reduce the sensitivity to voltage transient 
and PCB layout parasitic. The SGM836 immunes to 
short negative transients on the SENSE pin. Sensitivity 
to transients is dependent on the voltage overdrive on 
this pin. The SGM836-ADJ typical circuit shown in 
Figure 5, it can monitor any voltage rail as low as 
0.405V.

Setting the Reset Delay Time 
There are 3 typical applications to set the reset timeout 
delay in Figure 6, Figure 6 (a) shows the CT pin is 
connected to VDD through a resistor (from 40kΩ to 
200kΩ must be used) to configure for a fixed 300ms 
delay time. Figure 6 (b) shows leaving the CT pin open 
to set a fixed 20ms delay time. Figure 6 (c) shows that 
the user-defined time can be set through programming 
the capacitor between the CT pin and the ground. tD is 
always between 1.25ms and 10s.

Figure 6. Different Setting methods of the nRESET Delay 
Time 
The nominal value of CT should be at least 100pF, so 
that the SGM836 can identify the presence of the 
capacitor. The reset timeout delay can be calculated by 
using Equation 1: 
tD (μs) = (5.58 × 106) × CT (μF) + 520μs

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Internally there is a precise 216nA current source, 
which charges the external capacitor CT to 1.206V 
threshold, and this charge time will determine the reset 
timeout delay. 
The capacitor will be discharged if nRESET is asserted. 
After clearing the nRESET condition, the internal 
current source will be enabled and the external 
capacitor will be recharged. When the voltage on the 
capacitor reaches 1.206V, nRESET is set to invalid. It 
is recommended to use low leakage capacitors such as 
ceramics, and the stray capacitance around the pins 
may cause errors in the reset delay time. 
 
Manual Reset (nMR) Input 
The manual reset (nMR) input allows the operator, test 
technician, or external logic circuit to initiate a reset. A 
logic low (0.3 × VDD) on nMR forces the nRESET low. 
After nMR returns to a logic high and the SENSE 
voltage rises above its reset threshold, nRESET is 
deasserted after a reset delay time period (tD). nMR is 
pulled up to VDD with an internal 100kΩ resistor. This 
pin can be left floating if nMR is not used. 
Figure 7 shows how to use nMR to monitor multiple 
system voltages. If the logic signal does not drive nMR 
fully to VDD, some extra current will flow into VDD due to 
the pull-up resistor on nMR. Figure 8 shows how to use 
an external FET to minimize the current draw.

Figure 8. An External MOSFET is used to Minimize IDD 
nRESET Output 
As long as SENSE voltage exceeds VITL and the nMR 
is logic high, nRESET remains high (deasserted). 
Either VSENSE is lower than VITL or nMR is set low, 
nRESET will be low (asserted). 
If nMR returns to logic high again and SENSE voltage 
exceeds VITH (VITL + VHYS), nRESET will remain low for 
a fixed reset delay time due to the delay circuit function. 
As soon as the reset delay has expired, the nRESET 
turns into logic high. The pull-up resistor between 
nRESET and VDD can be used to reset the 
microprocessor signal to obtain a voltage above VDD 
voltage. The pull-up resistor should be no less than 
10kΩ due to the limited nRESET pull-down ability.

Normal Operation (VDD > VDD_MIN) 
When the VDD voltage is higher than VDD_MIN, the logic 
state of nRESET is determined by VSENSE and the logic 
state of nMR. 
• nMR high: When VDD voltage is higher than 1.65V for a 
selected time (tD), the nRESET logic state corresponds 
to VSENSE relative to VITL. 
• nMR low: nRESET is held low regardless of VSENSE in 
this mode. 
 
Above Power-On Reset but Lower than VDD_MIN 
(VPOR < VDD < VDD_MIN) 
When the VDD voltage is lower than VDD_MIN and higher 
than the power-on reset voltage (VPOR), the nRESET is 
asserted and driven to a low-impedance state. 
 
Below Power-On Reset (VDD < VPOR) 
When the VDD voltage is lower than the required voltage 
(VPOR), the nRESET voltage is undefined. In the case of 
nRESET pulling up to VDD through a 100kΩ resistor, 
nRESET voltage is equal to or lower than VDD voltage.

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
The SGM836 requires a voltage supply within 1.65V 
and 6.5V. Figure 9 shows a typical application of the 
SGM836-2.5 used with a 2.5V microprocessor. 
Normally, the nRESET output is connected to the 
nRESET input of the microprocessor. It is necessary to 
connect a 1MΩ pull-up resistor between nRESET and 
VDD to keep the nRESET logic high if it is not asserted. 
The reset delay time can be set by CT while it depends 
on the requirement of microprocessor. If left it open, a 
typical 20ms of reset delay time is set.

Voltage Transient on SENSE Pin 
The short negative transient on the SENSE pin of the 
SGM836 can be relatively immune. The sensitivity to 
voltage transients depends on the value of threshold 
overdrive. The larger the overdrive is, the faster the 
nRESET responses. VITL is the threshold voltage in 
Equation 2. Use the percent of the sense voltage 
threshold to calculate the threshold overdrive. 
Overdrive = | (VSENSE / VITL - 1) × 100% |   (2) 
 
Layout Guide 
It is recommended to connect a 0.1µF ceramic 
capacitor to the VDD pin as close as possible. If there is 
no connection capacitor, minimize the parasitic 
capacitor to avoid a significant impact on the nRESET 
delay time.
