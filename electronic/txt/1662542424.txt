GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM8751 is a single, high speed, low power 
comparator, which features a fast 64ns propagation 
delay. The device is optimized for low voltage operation 
on 3V or 5V supply, and consumes only 150µA supply 
current. 
The SGM8751 supports rail-to-rail output operation. 
The output voltage swing is within 215mV of the rails 
without external pull-up or pull-down resistor. The 
device can be compatible with CMOS and TTL logics. 
Any input or output pin has a continuous short-circuit 
protection to both power supply rails.  
The SGM8751 is available in a Green SOT-23-5 package. 
It is rated over the -40℃ to +85℃ temperature range.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
The SGM8751 is a single, high speed, low power 
comparator with internal hysteresis. The device is 
optimized for low voltage operation from 2.7V to 5.5V 
single supply. It supports rail-to-rail output operation. 
With 4mA output current, the output voltage swing is 
within 215mV of the rails without external pull-up or 
pull-down circuitry. The SGM8751 is suitable for 
portable equipment. It can be compatible with CMOS 
and TTL logics. 
 
Output Structure 
In Figure 1, the SGM8751 has a push-pull output stage. 
When output is changed from logic high/low to low/high, 
the changed sink/source current pulls/pushes output 
pin to logic low/high. Beginning this transition, larger 
sink/source current is used to create a high slew rate 
transit from high/low to low/high. Once the output 
voltage reaches VOL/VOH, it will reduce the sink/source 
current to a just right value to maintain the VOL/VOH 
static condition. This current-driven push-pull output 
stage will significantly reduce the power consumption in 
application system. 
If low slew rate transition is needed in system design, 
adjusting the load capacitance will change the slew rate. 
The heavier capacitive load will slow down the output 
voltage transition. This feature will be used to reduce 
the interference generated by fast edge of transition 
between 1 and 0 in noise-sensitive system.

Figure 3. The Application of Line Receiver 
Layout and Bypassing 
Good power supply decoupling, layout and grounding 
are very important for SGM8751 to realize the full 
high-speed capabilities in system, following skills will be 
used: 
 A 0.1µF to 4.7µF range ceramic capacitor is used to 
provide good power supply decoupling. This ceramic 
capacitor must be placed as close to +VS pin as 
possible. 
 For grounding, unbroken and low-inductance ground 
plane is a good choice. 
 For Layout, use short PCB trace to avoid unwanted 
parasitic feedback around the comparator. SGM8751 
must be soldered directly to the PCB and the socket is 
not recommended.
