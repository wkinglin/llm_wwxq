NOTE:  
1. The current limit and voltage limit are set for those values 
which applies onto the IN or TSEN pin current and voltage 
source for 10 minutes and should not cause any change to 
key operation parameters. 
OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.

NAME

FUNCTION 
1 
IN 
P 
Charge Power Input for Powering this Device and Feeding to the Charge Output. The 
capacitor with effective capacitance in the range of 0.1μF to 12μF is recommended. It 
should be placed close to this pin for decoupling. 
3 
TSEN 
IO 
Temperature Sensing and Enable Input. The external connection to this pin is checked, 
once power input voltage is in the effective range by feeding current (38.6μA) out of the 
pin. If the pin voltage is less than VENL (102mV), it is considered as being grounded. The 
charging function is disabled while the feeding current is reduced to about 25.5μA. If the 
pin voltage is higher than VENH (2.68V), charging function is enabled. If the pin voltage is 
between VENL and VENH, it is considered that the NTC thermistor is connected, and the 
ground resistance is evaluated for temperature safe charging. In this case, charging is 
allowed, only when the pin voltage is within the range of hot threshold resistance related 
voltage VHOT to cold threshold related voltage VCOLD. 
The feeding current biases the pin voltage to be higher than VCOLD but less than VENH. If 
pin voltage in this range is found, it is considered to be excessive cold condition or NTC 
connection open, charge function is disabled. 
4 
GND 
G 
Ground of the Circuit. 
8 
BAT 
O 
Output to the Battery and/or System Load for Charging and/or Powering the System Load. 
The output decoupling capacitor with effective capacitance in the range of 1μF to 12μF is 
recommended. The pin sinks about 4μA if the pin voltage is higher than charging voltage, 
and the pin sinks about 1.5mA if output clamp is triggered. 
2, 5, 6, 7 
NC 
NC 
No Internal Connection. 
Exposed 
Pad 
GND 
— 
Exposed Pad. Exposed pad is internally connected to GND. Connect it to a large ground 
plane to maximize thermal dissipation. 
 
NOTE:  
1. P = Power, IO = Input and Output, G = Ground, O = Output, NC = No Connection.

NOTES: 
1. Forced leakage may occur when temperature is higher than +85℃ for battery over-voltage free. 
2. VIN - VBAT need more than 95% × ICHG × RON when ICHG > 200mA. 
3. Both charge voltage and charge current are designed to drop in the temperature range over +130℃ and either charge voltage 
or charge current drops to zero by TFOLD. 
4. Timings may vary beyond the limits over +85℃ but functionality keeps. 
5. Guaranteed by design and characterization. Not production tested.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
The SGM41566A and SGM41566B are the constant- 
voltage and constant-current profile charge regulator 
with the input condition check. It features with input 
clamp, output clamp, die temperature regulation, NTC 
temperature-oriented protection and floating charging 
protection. As shown in Figure 1, there are only few 
external components desired. Figure 2 shows the 
illustrative charge profiles. 
 
Exhausted Battery Charging Inhibition 
If the voltage at BAT pin is below VINH once the 
charging input is applied on the IN pin, the charging 
does not start, which assures no risk charging to an 
exhausted battery. 
 
Wide Charge Available Input Range 
Charging is kept when the input voltage is higher than 
the nominal input range, or when the supply cannot 
keep voltage and current stable. The charge current is 
regulated to prevent over-heating when the input 
voltage is at the higher range end, and it keeps 
conduction and maintains minimum forward drop-out 
when the input voltage is at the lower range end. It can 
charge from pulse train input such as half-sine wave of 
rectified AC and slow change source like solar cell 
photo-voltage, while it keeps charge state flags until the 
internal bias losses or the input stays low for long 
enough. 
 
Voltage Fold-Back Power Retaining 
When the end-of-charge condition is certified, it lowers 
the output to the safe voltage VFCHG, while keeping the 
current limit at the level of normal charge and retaining 
power to the load system. The design avoids frequent 
discharging and recharging cycling in the situation that 
charge supply is always attached. 
 
Minimum Floating Charge Time 
When the charging current with high system load that 
sinks more than the residual end-of-charge current and 
the battery voltage stays higher than the floating charge 
voltage for over tFLT duration, the battery will stop 
charging and enter the end-of-charge fold-back power 
retaining state. As a weak source, it may also cause the 
current to fall to less than the residual end-of-charge 
current, and minimum floating charge time > tFLT/2 is a 
part of condition for full-of-charge certification. 
 
Over-Temperature Charge Regulation 
The device senses the die temperature. The thermal 
fold-back function starts to reduce the charge current 
when the internal temperature reaches the typical value 
of +130℃. 
 
BAT Over-Voltage Protection 
When any leakage or transient pulls VBAT higher than 
104% × VCHG in charge, the BAT sinks current with 
1.5mA clamp current for protection. 
 
Full-of-Charge and Input Clamp 
When the full-of-charge is certified, the input IIN drops 
low and the output voltage steps down from VCHG to 
VFCHG. The sudden current changes the signals to the 
source side for turning into the full-of-charge state, and 
the source side can read the state by checking the 
output voltage or current. In case of wireless or 
contactless charging with high open load voltage, the 
device clamps its input voltage to about 21V with 26mA 
sinking. 
 
NTC Temperature Sensing and Enable 
The TSEN sources current (38.6μA) is used to read 
ground resistance for temperature-oriented protection. 
A grounded NTC thermistor is connected to the TSEN 
pin for temperature sensing. Charging is allowed only 
when the temperature is in suitable range. When a 
β3380 R25 10kΩ NTC is used, the precise upper and 
lower thresholds are 45℃ and 0.5℃, respectively. 
Pull the TSEN to ground to disable charge function, and 
pull the TSEN to high voltage > 2.68V to dismiss the 
temperature-oriented protection function, while enables 
charge. 
 
Pre-Charge Safety Time 
To avoid further damage to bad battery or wrong 
system load, if the BAT pin voltage cannot reach 65% × 
VCHG for over tSAFE (94 minutes), the charging will be 
stopped.
