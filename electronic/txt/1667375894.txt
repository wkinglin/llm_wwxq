GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM853 is a reset timer with dual voltage detector 
featuring low power and small solution size for 
applications requiring a highly integrated solution.  
As a reset timer, the SGM853 has an input (RESET pin) 
and a fixed delay push-pull 1× output (RESET_OUT pin). 
It generates a low-level reset signal for 500ms (TYP) if 
the input has a low-level voltage for 8s (TYP). Then the 
reset signal returns to high for subsequent loads reset. 
The SGM853 also has two voltage detector functions 
with 4 inputs and 2 outputs including a push-pull 1× 
output and a push-pull 2× output. The 2× output 
provides greater source and sink current. On the one 
side, the ALL_PG output pin indicates whether the 3 
input pins (SUS_PG, VCC_PG and AUX_PG) are in a 
high-level voltage at the same time. If the above 3 input 
pins are high at the same time, the ALL_PG output pin 
is set to high, and vice versa. On the other side, the 
PROCHOT_OUT output pin generates a fixed 12ms 
delay time and indicates whether the PROCHOT input 
pin is in a high-level voltage. If PROCHOT rises to 
high-level voltage, PROCHOT_OUT rises after a fixed 
12ms 
delay 
time, 
and 
PROCHOT_OUT 
falls 
immediately when PROCHOT falls. 
The SGM853 operates over a junction temperature 
range of -40℃ to +125℃. It is available in a Green 
UTQFN-1.6×1.6-12AL package.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
The SGM853 is both a reset timer and a dual voltage 
detector that features low power and small solution size 
for applications requiring a highly integrated solution. 
 
Reset Timer 
A reset event occurs and forces the reset input (RESET 
pin) in a low-level input voltage for at least 8s. The 
RESET_OUT generates a low-level reset signal for 
500ms to shut down the subsequent loads or PMIC. 
Then the reset signal returns to a high-level voltage 
until the input pin is in the next low-level state for more 
than 8s. 
If the RESET is released and returns to high-level 
voltage within 8s, the counter resets and the 
RESET_OUT remains high. 
 
Detector 1: ALL_PG 
The ALL_PG output pin monitors 3 input pins at the 
same time: SUS_PG, VCC_PG and AUX_PG pins. If 
the application scenario requires voltage detection on 
up to 3 power rails, connect the power rail to the above 
three input pins respectively. 
 
Detector 2: PROCHOT and PROCHOT_OUT 
The PROCHOT_OUT pin is used to monitor PROCHOT 
input pin. If the PROCHOT input rises to a high-level 
voltage, the PROCHOT_OUT rises after a fixed delay 
time of 12ms, and PROCHOT_OUT falls immediately 
when PROCHOT in low-level voltage. If PROCHOT 
keeps 
in 
high-level 
voltage 
within 
12ms, 
the 
PROCHOT_OUT remains low.
