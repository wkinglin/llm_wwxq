OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
The SGM2030 is a low power and low dropout LDO and 
provides 300mA output current. These features make 
the device a reliable solution to solve many challenging 
problems in the generation of clean and accurate 
power supply. The high performance also makes the 
SGM2030 useful in a variety of applications. The 
SGM2030 provides protection functions for output 
overload, output short-circuit condition and overheating. 
 
Input Capacitor Selection (CIN) 
The input decoupling capacitor is necessary to be 
connected as close as possible to the IN pin for 
ensuring the device stability. 1μF or larger X7R or X5R 
ceramic capacitor is selected to get good dynamic 
performance. 
When VIN is required to provide large current 
instantaneously, a large effective input capacitor is 
required. Multiple input capacitors can limit the input 
tracking inductance. Adding more input capacitors is 
available to restrict the ringing and to keep it below the 
device absolute maximum ratings. 
 
Output Capacitor Selection (COUT) 
The output decoupling capacitor should be located as 
close as possible to the OUT pin. 1μF or larger X7R or 
X5R ceramic capacitor is selected to get good dynamic 
performance. The minimum effective capacitance of 
COUT that SGM2030 can remain stable is 0.5μF. For 
ceramic capacitor, temperature, DC bias and package 
size will change the effective capacitance, so enough 
margin of COUT must be considered in design. Larger 
capacitance and lower ESR COUT will help improve the 
load transient response and increase the high 
frequency PSRR. 
 
Enable Control 
The SGM2030 uses the EN pin to enable/disable its 
device. 
When the EN pin voltage is lower than 0.3V, the device 
is in shutdown state. 
When the EN pin voltage is higher than 1.5V, the device 
is in active state. The output voltage is regulated to 
expected value. 
 
Output Current Limit and Short-Circuit 
Protection 
When overload events happen, the output current is 
internally limited to 310mA (MIN). When the OUT pin is 
shorted to ground, the short-circuit protection will limit 
the output current. 
 
Thermal Shutdown 
The SGM2030 can detect the temperature of die. When 
the die temperature exceeds the threshold value of 
thermal shutdown, the SGM2030 will be in shutdown 
state and it will remain in this state until the die 
temperature decreases to +135℃. 
 
Layout Guidelines 
To get good PSRR, low output noise and high transient 
response performance, the input and output bypass 
capacitors must be placed as close as possible to the 
IN pin and OUT pin separately. VIN and VOUT had better 
use separate ground planes and these ground planes 
are single point connected to the GND pin.
