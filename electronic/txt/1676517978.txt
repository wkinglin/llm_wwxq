High Speed Piezo-Sounder and 
Ultra-Sound Transducer Driver

FEBRUARY2023–REV.A.1 
GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM4547 is matched dual-channel high speed 
piezo-sounder and ultra-sound transducer driver which 
is integrated boost DC/DC to achieve high driven 
voltage. The unique circuit design provides excellent 
performance for delivering 2A peak current to highly 
capacitive loads.  
To reduce problems with time and clock skew, 
SGM4547 is a good choice, with matching delays and 
maintaining integrity of input to output pulse-widths. 
Matching rise/fall delay times improve the drive 
capability and speed. Non-overlapping drive technology 
is used to minimize the dynamic switching loss. 
In order to get higher volume sound from piezo- 
sounder and ultra-sound transducer, boost DC/DC is 
integrated to provide high driven voltage. The tiny 
package makes the device very suitable for space 
limited applications. 
The SGM4547 is available in a Green TDFN-3×3-14L 
package. It operates over an ambient temperature 
range of -40℃ to +85℃.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.
