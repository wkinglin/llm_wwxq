GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM8264-2 bipolar-input headset driver achieves 
very low 1.6nV/ Hz  noise density with an ultra low 
distortion of 0.00002% at 1kHz. The SGM8264-2 offers 
rail-to-rail output swing to within 150mV of supply rails 
with a 2kΩ load, which increases headroom and 
maximizes dynamic range. The device also has a high 
output drive capability of ±110mA. 
The device operates over a wide supply range of 3.6V 
to 36V or ±1.8V to ±18V, on only 4.1mA of supply 
current per amplifier. The SGM8264-2 is unity-gain 
stable and provides excellent dynamic behavior over a 
wide range of load conditions. 
The SGM8264-2 is available in a Green SOIC-8 
package. It operates over an ambient temperature 
range of -40℃ to +85℃.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
The SGM8264-2 is a unity-gain stable, precision driver 
with very low noise; the device is also free from output 
phase reversal. Applications with noisy or high-impedance 
power supplies require decoupling capacitors close to 
the device power supply pins. In most cases, 0.1μF 
capacitors are adequate. 
 
Operating Voltage 
The SGM8264-2 driver operates from 3.6V to 36V or 
±2.25V to ±18V supplies while maintaining excellent 
performance. However, some applications do not 
require equal positive and negative output voltage 
swing. With the SGM8264-2, power supply voltages do 
not need to be equal. For example, the positive supply 
could be set to +25V with the negative supply at -5V. In 
all cases, the input common mode voltage must be 
maintained within the specified range. In addition, key 
parameters are assured over the specified temperature 
range of TA = -40℃ to +85℃. 
 
Input Protection 
The input terminals of the SGM8264-2 are protected 
from excessive differential voltage with back-to-back 
diodes, as Figure 1 illustrates. In most circuit applications, 
the input protection circuitry has no consequence. 
However, in low-gain or G = +1 circuits, fast ramping 
input signals can forward bias these diodes because 
the output of the amplifier cannot respond rapidly 
enough to the input ramp. If the input signal is fast 
enough to create this forward bias condition, the input 
signal current must be limited to 10mA or less. If the 
input signal current is not inherently limited, an input 
series resistor (RI) and/or a feedback resistor (RF) can 
be used to limit the signal input current. This input 
series resistor degrades the low-noise performance of 
the SGM8264-2 and is examined in the following Noise 
Performance section. Figure 1 shows an example 
configuration when both current-limit input and feedback 
resistors are used.

Equation 1 shows the total circuit noise for varying 
source impedances with the operational amplifier in a 
unity-gain configuration (Figure 2, no feedback resistor 
network, and therefore no additional noise contributions). 
The SGM8264-2 (GBP = 16MHz, G = +1) is shown with 
total circuit noise calculated. The operational amplifier 
itself contributes both a voltage noise component and a 
current noise component. The voltage noise is commonly 
modeled as a time-varying component of the offset 
voltage. The current noise is modeled as the time- 
varying component of the input bias current and reacts 
with the source resistance to create a voltage component 
of noise. Therefore, the lowest noise operational 
amplifier for a given application depends on the source 
impedance. For low source impedance, current noise is 
negligible, and voltage noise generally dominates. The 
low voltage noise of the SGM8264-2 driver makes it a 
good choice for use in applications where the source 
impedance is less than 1kΩ. 
The following equation shows the calculation of the

APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued) 
Basic Noise Calculations 
Design of low-noise operational amplifier circuits 
requires careful consideration of a variety of possible 
noise contributors: noise from the signal source, noise 
generated in the operational amplifier and noise from 
the feedback network resistors. The total noise of the 
circuit is the root-sum-square combination of all noise 
components. 
The resistive portion of the source impedance produces 
thermal noise proportional to the square root of the 
resistance. The source impedance is usually fixed; 
consequently, select the operational amplifier and the 
feedback 
resistors 
to 
minimize 
the 
respective 
contributions to the total noise. 
Figure 3 illustrates both inverting and non-inverting 
operational amplifier circuit configurations with gain. In 
circuit configurations with gain, the feedback network 
resistors also contribute noise. 
The current noise of the operational amplifier reacts 
with the feedback resistors to create additional noise 
components. The feedback resistor values can generally 
be chosen to make these noise sources negligible. The 
equations for total noise are shown for both 
configurations.

APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued) 
Total Harmonic Distortion Measurements 
The SGM8264-2 driver has excellent distortion 
characteristics. THD + noise is below 0.00015% (G = 
+1, VOUT = 3VRMS, BW = 80kHz) throughout the audio 
frequency range, 20Hz to 20kHz, with a 2kΩ load. 
The distortion produced by SGM8264-2 driver is below 
the measurement limit of many commercially available 
distortion analyzers. However, a special test circuit 
(such as Figure 4 shows) can be used to extend the 
measurement capabilities. 
Operational amplifier distortion can be considered an 
internal error source that can be referred to the input. 
Figure 4 shows a circuit that causes the operational 
amplifier distortion to be 101 times (or approximately 
40dB) greater than that normally produced by the 
operational amplifier. The addition of R3 to the otherwise 
standard non-inverting amplifier configuration alters the 
feedback factor or noise gain of the circuit. The 
closed-loop gain is unchanged, but the feedback 
available for error correction is reduced by a factor of 
101, thus extending the resolution by 101. Note that the 
input signal and load applied to the operational 
amplifier are the same as with conventional feedback 
without R3. The value of R3 should be kept small to 
minimize its effect on the distortion measurements.

Figure 4. Distortion Test Circuit 
 
Validity of this technique can be verified by duplicating 
measurements at high gain and/or high frequency 
where the distortion is within the measurement 
capability of the test equipment. Measurements for this 
datasheet were made with an Audio Precision System 
Two distortion/noise analyzer, which greatly simplifies 
such repetitive measurements. The measurement 
technique can, however, be performed with manual 
distortion measurement instruments. 
 
Capacitive Loads 
The dynamic characteristics of the SGM8264-2 have 
been optimized for commonly encountered gains, loads, 
and operating conditions. The combination of low 
closed-loop gain and high capacitive loads decreases 
the phase margin of the amplifier and can lead to gain 
peaking or oscillations. As a result, heavier capacitive 
loads must be isolated from the output. The simplest 
way to achieve this isolation is to add a small resistor 
(RS equal to 50Ω, for example) in series with the output. 
 
Power Dissipation 
SGM8264-2 driver is capable of driving 2kΩ loads with 
a power supply voltage up to ±18V. Internal power 
dissipation increases when operating at high supply 
voltages. Copper leadframe construction used in the 
SGM8264-2 driver improves heat dissipation compared 
to conventional materials. Circuit board layout can also 
help minimize junction temperature rise. Wide copper 
traces help dissipate the heat by acting as an additional 
heat sink. Temperature rise can be further minimized by 
soldering the device to the circuit board rather than 
using a socket. 
 
Electrical Overstress 
Designers often ask questions about the capability of 
an operational amplifier to withstand electrical overstress. 
These questions tend to focus on the device inputs, but 
may involve the supply voltage pins or even the output 
pin. Each of these different pin functions has electrical 
stress limits determined by the voltage breakdown 
characteristics of the particular semiconductor fabrication 
process and specific circuits connected to the pin. 
Additionally, internal electrostatic discharge (ESD) 
protection is built into these circuits to protect them 
from accidental ESD events both before and during 
product assembly.
