NOVEMBER2015–REV.A 
GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM8140 is a PIR sensor and vibration sensor 
analog front end which consists of 2 independent 
building block circuits. One is a dual rail-to-rail input 
and output operational amplifier, and the other is an 
ultra-low power comparator. Both the operational 
amplifier and the comparator have been specifically 
designed to operate over a wide range of voltages from 
1.4V to 5.5V. The SGM8140 only consumes 1.1μA 
working current, so it is ideal for use in a variety of 
battery-powered applications. 
The operational amplifier is unity-gain stable and 
features a 5kHz gain-bandwidth product. It is suitable 
for low frequency systems in the case of monitoring 
battery current and conditioning sensor signal. 
The comparator has a push-pull output, which drive 
resistive or capacitive with absolute lowest power 
consumption. 
The SGM8140 is available in a Green TQFN-4×4-16L 
package. It is specified for the -40 ℃ to +85 ℃ 
industrial temperature range. 
FEATURES 
● Ultra-Low Power: 1.1μA (TYP) at VS = 5V 
● Wide Supply Voltage Range: 1.4V to 5.5V 
● Rail-to-Rail Input and Output Amplifier

● Comparator Propagation Delay: 6μs (TYP) 
● Comparator Push-Pull Output Current Drive: 
19mA (TYP) at VS = 5V 
● -40℃ to +85℃ Operating Temperature Range 
● Available in a Green TQFN-4×4-16L Package

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.
