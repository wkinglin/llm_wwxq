GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM41528 is a battery charger and system power path 
management device for 2-cell Li-Ion or Li-polymer batteries. 
Its low-impedance power path optimizes efficiency, reduces 
battery charging time, and extends battery life. I2C 
programming makes it a flexible powering and charger design 
solution. 
The SGM41528 can detect the input source types which 
include SDP/CDP/DCP and non-standard adapter through 
the D+/D- pins following USB BC1.2 Specification. 
The SGM41528 features a dynamic power management 
(DPM) to avoid input adapter overloading or to meet the 
maximum current limit. It keeps the system voltage regulated 
to its minimum setting in DPM mode by reducing the charge 
current. The SGM41528 also provides supplement mode to 
further support system output in case that the charge current 
decreased to zero and input is still overload. The SGM41528 
can provide the maximum power point with an algorithm 
called input current optimizer to avoid the input source from 
overloading. 
The SGM41528 supports the default mode (standalone) 
without host control. It automatically detects the battery 
voltage and starts the charge. A charge cycle automatically 
terminates when a full charge is detected if the device is not 
in 
thermal 
regulation 
or 
DPM 
mode. 
The 
charger 
automatically initiates a new charging cycle if the battery 
voltage falls below the recharge threshold.  
The SGM41528 supports USB On-The-Go (OTG) operation 
by supplying default 5.1V on the VBUS with an output current 
limit up to 2A. 
The SGM41528 provides full protections for safety of battery 
charging and system operation, including battery temperature 
monitoring, 
charging 
safety 
timer, 
over-current 
and 
over-voltage protections. When any fault occurs, the 
SGM41528 asserts a nINT pulse to notify the host.  
The SGM41528 is available in a Green WLCSP-2.1×2.1-25B 
package.

ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

2. The voltage spikes on SW pins should be less than the 
absolute maximum rating. Following the layout guidelines is 
helpful to minimize the switching noise. 
 
OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied.

PIN DESCRIPTION (continued) 
PIN 
NAME 
TYPE (1) 
FUNCTION 
D3 
ILIM 
AI 
Input Current Limit. A resistor between ILIM and GND pins can clamp the input current limit as IINMAX = 
KILIM/RILIM. When EN_ILIM = 1, the lower limit between IINDPM[4:0] registers and ILIM pin resistor setting 
set the actual input current limit. The ILIM pin can supply higher than 500mA current limit only. If the 
current limit is not triggered, the ILIM pin voltage indicates the actual input current limit by IIN = KILIM × 
VILIM/(RILIM × 0.8V). Change EN_ILIM = 0 can disable both input current limit clamping and input current 
monitor function from ILIM pin. 
D4 
REGN 
P 
Gate Drive Power Supply. Power supply for internal MOSFET drivers and IC. Connect a 4.7μF ceramic 
capacitor from REGN pin to GND. It is recommended to place the capacitor close to REGN pin.

E3 
TS 
AI 
Temperature Sense Input Pin. Connect to the battery NTC thermistor that is grounded on the other side. 
To program operating temperature window, it can be biased by a resistor divider between REGN and 
GND. When TS pin voltage goes to hot or cold range, the charge suspends. It is recommended to use a 
103AT-2 type thermistor.

with Boost Mode for USB Input

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
The SGM41528 is a battery charger and system power path 
management device with integrated Boost converter and 
power switches for use with 2-cell Li-Ion or Li-polymer batteries. 
The device includes four main power switches: input blocking 
MOSFET (Q1, QBLK), high-side switching MOSFET (Q2, 
HSFET), low-side switching MOSFET (Q3, LSFET), and 
battery MOSFET (Q4, BATFET). 
 
Power-On Reset (POR) 
The internal circuit of the device is powered from the greater 
voltage between VVBUS and VBAT. When the voltage of the 
selected source goes above its UVLO level (VVBUS > 
VVBUS_UVLOZ or VBAT > VBAT_UVLOZ), a POR happens and 
activates the BATFET driver. Upon activation, the I2C 
interface will also be ready for communication, and all the 
registers reset to their default values. 
 
Power-Up from Battery Only (No Input 
Source) 
When there have no other input source but only the battery, 
that the voltage is higher than the UVLO threshold 
(VBAT_UVLOZ), is presented, the BATFET turns on to connect 
the system to the battery. The quiescent current is minimum 
because the REGN LDO remains off. Conduction losses are 
also low due to small RDSON of BATFET. Low losses help to 
extend the battery run time. The discharge current through 
BATFET is continuously monitored. 
 
Power-Up Process from the Input Power 
Source 
Upon connection of an input source (VBUS), the input source 
from VBUS pin is checked to turn on the internal REGN LDO 
regulator and the bias circuits (no matter whether the battery 
is present or not). Before the Boost converter starts, the 
device is detected and set the input current limit threshold. 
The sequences of actions when VBUS as input source is 
powered up are: 
1. Poor power source detection (qualification). 
2. Input power source type detection. (Based on D+/D- 
inputs. It is used to set the default input current limit 
(IINDPM[4:0]).) 
3. REGN LDO power-up. 
4. DC/DC converter power-up. 
Details of the power-up steps are explained in the following 
sections. 
 
Poor Power Source Detection (Qualification) 
When valid VBUS is plugged in, the input power source 
(adapter or other source) is checked for its type and current 
capacity. To start the Boost converter, the input (VBUS) must 
meet the following conditions: 
1. VVBUS < VVBUS_OV. 
2. VVBUS > VBAD_SRC + VBAD_SRC_HYS (100mV TYP) during tBAD_SRC 
test period (30ms TYP) in which the IBAD_SRC (7.6mA TYP) 
current is pulled from VBUS. 
Once the VBUS over-voltage protection is detected, the 
SGM41528 will automatically retry the detection when the 
over-voltage fault condition disappears. If above condition 2 is 
detected (bad source adapter), the SGM41528 retries the 
detection and enters HIZ mode (EN_HIZ bit is reset to 0) after 
7 consecutive failures. In HIZ mode, the system is supplied by 
the battery only. Resume the converter operation requires 
re-plugging the adapter and/or toggling the EN_HIZ bit. When 
the adapter is plugged in, the EN_HIZ bit is automatically 
reset to 0. 
 
Input Power Source Type Detection 
The input power source detection will run through the D+/D- 
lines after the adapter passes the poor source qualification 
when the AUTO_INDET_EN bit is set to 1. The SGM41528 
follows the USB Battery Charging Specification 1.2 (BC1.2) to 
detect input adapter power source type via D+/D- lines. All the 
types of SDP/CDP/DCP and non-standard adapter can be 
automatically detected and indicated. When the input power 
source type detection is completed, the statuses of some 
related registers and pins are updated as detailed below: 
1. Input current limit register (IINDPM[4:0]) is changed to set 
the right current limit. 
2. Change the input voltage limit register (VINDPM[4:0]) to 
default setting if EN_VINDPM_RST = 1. Keep VINDPM[4:0] 
register value unchanged if EN_VINDPM_RST = 0. 
3. Change the VBUS_STAT[2:0] bits according to the input 
source type detection result. 
4. The PG_STAT bit is set to 1 and the nPG pin is pulled to 
logic low. 
5. The nINT pin is pulsed to notify the host. 
The input current or the input voltage is always limited by the 
IINDPM[4:0] or VINDPM[4:0] register and the limit can be 
updated by the host if needed. Regardless of the input current 
optimizer (ICO) setting, the charger input current is always 
limited by the lower value of the IINDPM[4:0] register or the 
current limit set by ILIM pin.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
The input power source type detection is ignored if 
AUTO_INDET_EN = 0. In this case, the IINDPM[4:0] register 
remains unchanged and the VBUS_STAT[2:0] bits keep 000 
(no input). If EN_VINDPM_RST bit is set to 0 by the host 
before the input power source type detection, the VINDPM[4:0] 
register remains unchanged. 
 
Input Current Limit by D+/D- Detection 
The input current limit of SGM41528 is determined and set by 
the integrated D+/D- based input power source detection. 
Four major steps are included in the D+/D- detection: VBUS 
detection, data contact detection (DCD, detect non-standard 
adapter), primary detection (detect SDP), and secondary 
detection (detect CDP and DCP). Please refer to Figure 3. 
Table 1 shows the non-standard adapter type detection. 
After the input power source type detection is completed, the 
nINT pin sends out a low pulse to notify the host. In addition, 
the VBUS_STAT[2:0] bits and the IINDPM[4:0] register are 
updated as below, refer to Table 2. 
 
Input Current Limit Force Detection 
In host mode, the host can set FORCE_INDET = 1 to force 
the charger to run the input current limit detection. The 
FORCE_INDET bit automatically reset to 0 once the detection 
is done. Due to the force detection result, the VBUS_STAT[2:0] 
bits and IINDPM[4:0] register may be changed.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
REGN LDO Power-Up 
The REGN low dropout regulator powers the internal bias 
circuits, HSFET and LSFET gate drivers and TS rail 
(thermistor pin). The nPG pin can also be pulled up to REGN. 
The REGN LDO enables when the following 3 conditions are 
satisfied and remain valid for 220ms delay time, otherwise the 
device stays in HIZ mode, and the REGN LDO keeps off. 
1. VVBUS > VVBUS_UVLOZ (in forward direction Boost mode) or 
VVBUS < VVBUS_UVLOZ (in reverse direction OTG Buck mode). 
2. A valid input source is detected by the poor power source 
detection. 
3. Input power source type detection is done. 
In HIZ state, the quiescent current drawn from VBUS is very 
small (less than IVBUS_HIZ). System is only powered by the 
battery in HIZ mode. 
 
DC/DC Converter Power-Up 
The input current limit is set when input source detection is 
completed, then the VBUS_STAT[2:0] bits update to indicate 
the input source type, the nPG changes to logic low to 
indicate the power good and the PG_STAT and PG_FLAG 
bits also give the corresponding indication. The 1.5MHz 
switching converter composed of LSFET and HSFET is 
enabled and can start switching. Converter is initiated with a 
soft-start when the system voltage is ramped up.  
The BATFET remains on to charge the battery if the battery 
charging function is enabled, otherwise BATFET turns off. 
The SGM41528 provides an auto-run battery discharge 
source (IBAT_DISCHG, 11mA (TYP)) for 13ms to detect the 
battery presence prior to the charge starts. During normal 
operation (include HIZ mode or battery only operation), this 
discharge 
current 
also 
can 
be 
enabled 
by 
setting 
EN_BAT_DISCHG bit to 1.  
At light load condition, if charging is disabled or the battery 
voltage is lower than VSYS_MIN, the SGM41528 changes from 
PWM mode to PFM mode. The SYS and BUS voltage 
relationship decides the switching duty cycle during the PFM 
operation. Host can disable the PFM operation via writing 
PFM_DIS = 1. If the PFM mode is selected, the out-of-audio 
(OOA) feature can be chosen under PFM_OOA_DIS = 0 
condition. In OOA operation mode, the converter switching 
frequency is larger than 20kHz even at extremely light load to 
prevent the audible range operation. 
 
Input Current Optimizer (ICO) 
The SGM41528 provides input current optimizer (ICO) to 
identify the input adapter source maximum power point. To 
avoid the input adapter source overload and staying in 
VINDPM, the ICO algorithm identifies maximum input current 
limit of the adapter automatically and updates this input 
current limit to ICO_ILIM[4:0] register. 
The ICO function is default enabled, and it can be disabled by 
the host through setting EN_ICO bit to 0. After a DCP type 
power source is detected, the ICO algorithm runs 
automatically when EN_ICO bit is valid. The host can set 
FORCE_ICO bit to force the ICO algorithm under EN_ICO bit 
to 1 condition. Refer to Table 3. 
The actual input current limit is reported by ICO_ILIM[4:0] 
register in ICO mode, while it is decided by the IINDPM[4:0] 
register when out of ICO mode. In addition, the actual input 
current is also limited by an external resistor at ILIM pin when 
EN_ILIM = 1.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
When the ICO algorithm is activated, it runs to dynamically 
and continuously adjust the input current limit using 
ICO_ILIM[4:0] 
register. 
During 
the 
adjustment, 
the 
ICO_STAT[1:0] and ICO_FLAG bits change until they are 
finally set. The operation of ICO algorithm depends on the 
battery voltage as following: 
Case 1: When VBAT < VSYS_MIN, the device starts ICO 
algorithm by ICO_ILIM[4:0] register with an initial value that 
equals the IINDPM. Where the IINDPM is the maximum input 
current limit that determined by the system. 
Case 2: When VBAT > VSYS_MIN, the device starts ICO 
algorithm by ICO_ILIM[4:0] register with an initial value of 
500mA. The 500mA is the minimum input current limit which 
minimizes the input power source overload. 
During the optimization, if VINDPM is triggered, the ICO 
algorithm decreases the input current limit (the dynamic 
ICO_ILIM[4:0] register) to avoid input source overloading. 
When the maximum input current limit is detected, the 
ICO_ILIM[4:0] register reflects the optimal maximum input 
current limit which is not trigger VINDPM. The ICO_FLAG bit 
is set and the ICO_STAT[1:0] bits are updated to 10 to 
indicate the maximum input current detected. 
In above case 1, if both VINDPM and IINDPM are not 
triggered at ICO_ILIM[4:0] initial value, the ICO_ILIM[4:0] 
register keeps the initial value and the ICO_STAT[1:0] = 01 to 
indicate the ICO optimization is in process. If the load 
becomes heavy, the VINDPM still not be triggered but 
IINDPM is triggered, the ICO algorithm is also completed, the 
ICO_ILIM[4:0] register keeps the initial value still, the 
ICO_FLAG bit is set and ICO_STAT[1:0] bits are updated to 
10 to indicate the maximum input current detected. 
In above case 2, if the VINDPM is not triggered and the 
converter is under light load condition, the ICO_ILIM[4:0] 
gives the input current limit a little higher than the actual input 
current 
(500mA 
minimum 
input 
current 
limit). 
The 
ICO_STAT[1:0] bits remain 01 to indicate the ICO 
optimization is in process. If the load becomes heavy, the ICO 
algorithm automatically runs to set new ICO_ILIM[4:0] 
register value. 
Once the ICO algorithm is completed (ICO_STAT[1:0] = 10), 
the ICO_ILIM[4:0] register will keep un-change unless one of 
the following events occurs. Each of the following events can 
force the ICO algorithm to run again and reset the 
ICO_STAT[1:0] bits to 01: 
1. EN_HIZ bit is toggled or re-plugin the input source.  
2. Host changes the IINDPM[4:0] register. 
3. Host changes the VINDPM[4:0] register. 
4. Host sets the FORCE_ICO bit to 1. 
5. Resume from VBUS_OVP. 
 
OTG Buck Mode 
The SGM41528 supports USB On-The-Go (OTG). When a 
load device is connected to the USB port, the converter can 
operate as a Buck synchronous converter (Buck mode) with 
1.5MHz switching frequency to supply power from the battery 
to that load. The USB OTG output current limit is 
programmable from 500mA to 2A (default). Converter will be 
set to Buck mode if at least 30ms is passed from enabling this 
mode (EN_OTG bit = 1) and the following conditions are 
satisfied: 
1. VBAT > VOTG_BAT. 
2. VVBUS < VVBUS_PRESENT. 
3. TS pin voltage is out of VBHOTx and VBCOLDx range. 
The default output Voltage is set to VVBUS = 5.1V (via 
OTG_VLIM[3:0] register) and is maintained as long as VBAT is 
above VOTG_BAT, and the VVBUS is above VVBUS_PRESENT. The 
output current can reach up to the programmed value by 
OTG_ILIM[3:0] register (2A). The VBUS_STAT[2:0] status 
bits are set to 111 in Buck mode (OTG). 
In OTG Buck mode, the SGM41528 default works in PFM 
mode at light load to improve the efficiency. The SYS and 
BUS voltage relationship decides the switching duty cycle. 
Host can disable the OTG PFM operation via writing 
PFM_DIS bit. If the PFM mode is selected, the out-of-audio 
(OOA) feature can be chosen under PFM_OOA_DIS = 0 
condition. In OOA operation mode, the converter switching 
frequency is larger than 20kHz even at extremely light load to 
prevent the audible range operation.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Host Mode and Default Mode Operation 
with Watchdog Timer 
After power-on reset (POR), the SGM41528 starts in default 
mode (standalone) with all registers reset to default values as 
if the watchdog timer is expired. When the host is in sleep 
mode or there is no host, the device stays in the default mode 
in which the SGM41528 operates like an autonomous charger. 
After 16.5 hours (default fast charging safety timer), the 
device stops charging the battery by turning off the BATFET, 
while the Boost converter continuously supplies the system 
load without shutdown. 
Most of the flexibility features of the SGM41528 become 
available in the host mode when the device is controlled by a 
host with I2C. By setting the WD_RST bit to 1, the device 
changes to host mode. In this mode, the WD_STAT bit is low 
and all device parameters can be programmed in order to 
prevent the device watchdog reset from going back to the 
default mode, the host must disable the watchdog timer by 
writing 00 to WATCHDOG[1:0], or consistently reset the 
watchdog timer before expiry by writing 1 to WD_RST bit to 
prevent WD_STAT bit from being set. Every time a 1 is written 
to WD_RST bit, the watchdog timer will restart counting. 
Therefore, it should be reset again before overflow (expiry) to 
keep the device in the host mode. The SGM41528 goes back 
to default mode and resets all related registers when the 
watchdog timer expires.

Battery Charging Management 
The SGM41528 is designed for charging 2-cell Li-Ion or 
Li-polymer batteries with a charge current up to 2.2A (MAX). 
The battery connection switch (BATFET) is in the charge or 
discharge current path and features low on-resistance to 
allow high efficiency and low voltage drop. 
 
Charging Cycle in Autonomous Mode 
Charging is enabled if EN_CHG = 1 and nCE pin is pulled low. 
In default mode, the SGM41528 runs a charge cycle with the 
default parameters itemized in Table 4. At any moment, the 
host can be controlled by changing to the host mode.

Start a New Charging Cycle 
If the converter can start switching and all the following 
conditions are satisfied, a new charge cycle starts: 
• NTC temperature fault is not asserted (TS pin). 
• Safety timer fault is not asserted. 
• Charging enabled (2 conditions: EN_CHG bit = 1, nCE pin is 
low). 
• Battery voltage is below the programmed full charge level 
(VREG). 
A new charge cycle starts automatically if battery voltage falls 
below the recharge threshold level (VREG - 100mV or VREG - 
200mV configured by VRECHG[1:0] bits). Also, if the charge 
cycle is finished, a new charging cycle can be initiated by 
toggling of the nCE pin or EN_CHG bit. 
Normally a charge cycle terminates when the charge voltage 
is above the recharge threshold level and the charging 
current falls below the termination threshold if the device is 
not in thermal regulation or dynamic power management 
(DPM) mode.

Charge Status Report 
The charge status bits (CHRG_STAT[2:0]) indicate the 
charging phases of the device as below: 
• 000 = Not Charging 
• 001 = Trickle Charge 
• 010 = Pre-Charge 
• 011 = Fast Charge (CC Mode) 
• 100 = Taper Charge (CV Mode) 
• 101 = Top-Off Timer Active 
• 110 = Charge Termination 
When the device changes to any of the above statuses, or the 
charge cycle is completed, the nINT pin is pulsed to notify the 
host. 
Battery Charging Profile 
The SGM41528 features a full battery charging profile with 
five phases. When a charging cycle starts, the battery voltage 
(VBAT) is tested and appropriate current and voltage regulation 
levels are selected as shown in Table 5. Depending on the 
detected status of the battery, the proper phase is selected to 
start or for continuation of the charging cycle. The five phases 
are: trickle charge (battery voltage too low), pre-charge, 
constant current, constant voltage and an optional top-off 
trickle charging phase. 
Note that in the DPM or thermal regulation modes, normal 
charging functions are temporarily modified: the charge 
current is less than the value in the register; termination is 
disabled, and the charging safety timer is slowed down by 
counting at half clock rate.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Charge Termination 
A charge cycle is terminated when the battery voltage is 
higher than the recharge threshold and the charge current 
falls below the programmed termination current. Unless there 
is a high power demand for system and it needs to operate in 
supplement mode, the BATFET turns off at the end of the 
charge cycle. Even after termination, the Boost converter 
operates continuously to supply the system. 
CHRG_STAT[2:0] bits are set to 110 and a negative pulse is 
sent to nINT pin after termination.  
If the charger is regulating input current, input voltage or 
junction temperature instead of charge current, termination 
will be temporarily prevented. EN_TERM bit is a termination 
control bit and can be set to 0 to permanently disable 
termination before it happens. 
Due to offset of the internal current comparator, the 
termination charge current may be much higher (40% TYP) 
than the set value when it is set too low (50mA TYP). A delay 
in termination can be added (optional) as a compensation for 
comparator offset using a programmable top-off timer. During 
the delay, constant voltage charge phase continues and gives 
the falling charge current the chance to drop closer to the 
programmed value. The top-off delay timer has the same 
restrictions of the safety timer. In other words, if the safety 
timer is suspended under certain conditions, the top-off timer 
will also be suspended or if the safety timer is slowed down, 
the top-off timer will also be slowed down. Code 101 in 
CHRG_STAT[2:0] indicates that the top-off timer is valid. The 
CHRG_STAT[2:0] bits change to 110 after the top-off timer 
expires. And the nINT pin reports a negative pulse to notify 
the host. 
Any of the following events resets the top-off timer:  
1. Disable to enable transition of nCE (charge enable). 
2. A low to high change in the status of termination. 
3. Set REG_RST bit to 1. 
The setting of the top-off timer is applied at the time of 
termination detection and unless a new charge cycle is 
started, modifying the top-off timer parameters after 
termination has no effect. A negative pulse is sent to nINT 
when top-off timer is started or ended. If set CHRG_MASK bit 
to 1, the CHRG_STAT[2:0] bits change will not produce nINT 
pulse. 
Temperature Qualification 
The charging current and voltage of the battery must be 
limited when battery is cold or hot. A thermistor input for 
battery temperature monitoring is included in the device that 
can protect the battery based on JEITA guidelines. There is 
no battery temperature protection when Boost or Buck 
converter stops switching. 
 
Compliance with JEITA Guideline 
JEITA guideline (April 20, 2007 release) is implemented in the 
device for safe charging of the Li-Ion battery. JEITA highlights 
the considerations and limits that should to be considered for 
charging at cold or hot battery temperatures. High charge 
current and voltage must be avoided outside normal 
operating temperatures (typically 0 ℃ and 60 ℃). Four 
temperatures levels are defined by JEITA from T1 (minimum) 
to T4 (maximum). Outside this range, charging should be 
stopped. The corresponding voltages sensed by NTC are 
named VT1 to VT4. Due to the sensor negative resistance, a 
higher temperature results in a lower voltage on TS pin. The 
battery cool range is between T1 and T2, the warm range is 
between T3 and T4. Charge must be limited in the cool and 
warm ranges. 
One of the conditions for starting a charge cycle is having the 
TS voltage within VT1 to VT4 window limits. If during the 
charge, battery gets too cold or too hot and TS voltage 
exceeds the T1 - T4 limits, charging is suspended (zero 
charge current) and the controller waits for the battery 
temperature to come back within the T1 to T4 window. 
JEITA recommends reducing charge current to 1/2 of fast 
charging current or lower at cool temperatures (T1 - T2). For 
warmer temperature (within T3 - T4 range), charge voltage is 
recommended to be kept below 4.1V/cell. 
The SGM41528 follows the JEITA requirement by its flexible 
charge parameter settings. At warm temperature range (T3 - 
T4), the charge voltage can be set to 8.0V (default), 8.3V, 
VREG, or charge suspend through JEITA_VSET[1:0] register. 
At cool temperatures (T1 - T2), the fast charge current can be 
set to 100%, 40%, or 20% (default) of ICHG or charge suspend 
through JEITA_ISETC[1:0] bits. The charge termination is still 
enabled (if EN_TERM = 1) when the "cool" or "warm" 
temperature is detected.

OTG Buck Mode Temperature Monitoring 
The device is capable to monitor the battery temperature for 
safety during the OTG Buck mode. The temperature must 
remain within the VBCOLDx to VBHOTx thresholds, otherwise the 
OTG mode will be suspended and VBUS_STAT[2:0] bits are 
set to 000. Moreover, TS_STAT[2:0] bits are updated to report 
OTG mode cold or hot condition. Once the temperature 
returns within the right window, the OTG Buck mode is 
resumed and TS_STAT[2:0] bits are cleared to 000 (normal).

Safety Timer 
Abnormal battery conditions may result in prolonged charge 
cycles. An internal safety timer is considered to stop charging 
in such conditions. If the charging safety timer timeout occurs, 
TMR_STAT bit is set and a negative pulse is sent to nINT pin. 
This feature is optional and can be disabled by setting 
EN_TIMER bit to 0. 
The safety timer counts at half clock rate when charger is 
under input voltage regulation, input current regulation or 
thermal regulation, and the actual charge current is always 
decreased. As an example, if the charging safety timer is set 
to 7.5 hours and the charger is under input current regulation 
(IINDPM_STAT = 1) in the whole charge cycle, the actual 
safety time will be 15 hours. Clearing the TMR2X_EN bit will 
disable the half clock rate feature. If TMR2X_EN = 1 and 
SGM41528 is already in DPM or thermal regulation, writing 
the TMR2X_EN = 0 will not take effect. 
The safety timer is paused if supplement mode occurs or a 
fault occurs which disables the charging. The TMR2X_EN bit 
also has no effect in this condition because the timer counting 
has stopped. It will resume once the fault condition is 
removed. If charging cycle is stopped and restarted by 
toggling nCE pin or EN_CHG bit, the timer resets and restarts 
a new timing. 
The fast charge safety timer can be reset by the following 
events: 
1. Stop and restart the charging cycle (change EN_CHG bit, 
toggle nCE pin, or charged battery falls below recharge 
threshold). 
2. Charge status changes between pre-charge and fast 
charge (in default mode or host mode). 
The pre-charge safety timer including both trickle charge 
phase and pre-charge phase is fixed 2 hours counter and  
runs when VBAT < VBAT_LOW, it follows the same rules as the 
fast charge safety timer in terms of reset, getting suspended, 
and half-rate counting when TMR2X_EN is valid. 
 
Narrow Voltage DC (NVDC) Design in SGM41528 
The SGM41528 features an NVDC design using the BATFET 
that connects the system and battery. By using the linear 
region of the BATFET, the charger regulates the system bus 
voltage (SYS pin) above the minimum setting using Boost 
converter even if the battery voltage is very low. MOSFET 
linear mode allows the large voltage difference between SYS 
and BAT pins to appear as VDS across the switch while 
conducting and charging battery. SYS_MIN[3:0] register sets 
the minimum system voltage (default 7V). If the system is in 
minimum system voltage regulation, VSYS_STAT bit is set. 
The BATFET operates in linear region when the battery 
voltage is lower than the minimum system voltage. The 
system voltage is regulated at 300mV (TYP) higher than the 
minimum system voltage. As the battery gradually gets 
charged, until its voltage rises above the minimum system 
voltage, the BATFET changes from linear mode to fully 
turned-on mode, and the system voltage keeps VDS of 
BATFET higher than the battery voltage. 
The system voltage is always regulated to 100mV (TYP) 
above the battery voltage if: 
1. The charging is terminated. 
2. Charging is disabled and the battery voltage is above the 
minimum system voltage setting.

SGM41528 Dynamic Power Management (DPM) 
The SGM41528 features a dynamic power management 
(DPM). To implement DPM, the device always monitors the 
input current and voltage to regulate power demand from the 
source and avoid input adapter overloading or to meet the 
maximum current limits specified in the USB specifications. 
Overloading an input power source may result in either the 
voltage tending to fall below the input voltage limit (VINDPM) or 
the current trying to exceed the input current limit (IINDPM or 
ICO_ILIM[4:0] or ILIM pin setting). With DPM, the device 
keeps the VSYS regulated to its minimum setting by reducing 
the battery charge current adequately such that the input 
parameter (voltage or current) does not exceed the limit. In 
other words, charge current is reduced to satisfy IIN ≤ IINDPM or 
VIN ≥ VINDPM whichever occurs first. DPM can be either an IIN 
type (IINDPM) or VIN type (VINDPM), depending on which 
limit is reached. 
Changing to the supplement mode may be required if the 
charge current is decreased and reached to zero while the 
input is still overloaded. In this case, the charger reduces the 
system voltage below the battery voltage to allow operation in 
the supplement mode and provide a portion of system power 
demand from the battery through the BATFET. 
The IINDPM_STAT or VINDPM_STAT status bits are set 
during an IINDPM or VINDPM respectively. Figure 10 
summarizes the DPM behavior (IINDPM type) for a design 
example with a 5V/3A adapter, 6.5V battery, 1.5A charge 
current setting and 7V minimum system voltage setting.

Battery Supplement Mode 
When the system is under heavy load, the system voltage 
may drop below the battery voltage, the BATFET gradually 
starts to turn on. At low discharge currents, the BATFET gate 
voltage is regulated (RDS modulation). At higher currents, the 
BATFET will turn fully on (reaching its lowest RDSON). From 
this point, increasing the discharge current will linearly 
increase the BATFET VDS (determined by RDSON × ID). Using 
the MOSFET linear mode at lower currents prevents swinging 
oscillation of entering and exiting the supplement mode. 
BATFET gate regulation V-I characteristic is shown in Figure 
11. If the battery voltage falls below its minimum depletion, 
the BATFET turns off and exits supplement mode.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
16-Bit ADC 
The integrated 16-bit ADC in SGM41528 allows the user to 
get critical system information for optimizing the charger 
behavior. The ADC related functions are controlled by ADC 
control register. The ADC_EN bit gives the option to enable or 
disable the ADC for power save purpose. The ADC 
conversion behavior can be set to continuous or one-shot 
mode through the ADC_RATE bit. The ADC_EN bit is 
automatically cleared once a one-shot conversion cycle 
completes. Re-assert ADC_EN bit can start a new 
conversion. 
Set ADC_EN bit to 1 to enable the ADC. The ADC can be 
operated when VBAT or VBUS is valid (VBAT > VBAT_UVLOZ or 
VVBUS_UVLOZ < VVBUS < VVBUS_OV). The SGM41528 will not 
execute the ADC under both VBAT and VBUS are invalid, and 
the ADC result registers will not be updated. In addition, the 
SGM41528 resets ADC_EN bit without sending any pulse on 
nINT pin. The ADC behaves the same if the ADC_EN bit is 
set while all ADC channels' enable bits are 0. To ensure that 
ADC is running a conversion, it is recommended to read back 
ADC_EN bit after setting it to 1. The ADC conversion is 
interrupted if the charger mode changes during ADC 
conversion running (e.g. EN_OTG bit goes to 1, EN_HIZ bit 
goes to 1 or an adapter plug-in). The ADC resumes with the 
interrupted channel when the mode change is complete. 
The sample speed is programmable via ADC_SAMPLE[1:0] 
bits, and the ADC conversion time (tADC_CONV) for each 
measurement is changed according to ADC_SAMPLE[1:0] 
bits setting. By default, the ADC function disable register 
(REG0x16) is set to 0x00 and all ADC channel will be 
converted in both continuous and one-shot conversion 
modes.  
If one bit of ADC function disable register (REG0x16) is set to 
1 before the conversion, the corresponding channel ADC 
conversion data is not updated to the ADC result registers. In 
this case, the data host read-back from the ADC result 
register is from the default POR value or the last valid ADC 
conversion. If one bit of ADC function disable register 
(REG0x16) is set to 1 during the ADC conversion cycle, the 
SGM41528 finishes this channel conversion in this cycle, and 
not converts this channel in next cycle.  
In continuous conversion mode, as long as the ADC_EN bit is 
set to 1, the ADC circuitry is active even if all ADC channel 
conversion is disabled by REG0x16. In one-shot mode, the 
ADC_EN bit is cleared automatically if all ADC channel 
conversion is disabled. Once one bit in REG0x16 is set to 0, 
the ADC conversion begins soon.  
In continuous conversion mode, the ADC_DONE_STAT bit 
keeps 0 and ADC_DONE_FLAG bit remains unchanged. The 
ADC_DONE_STAT and ADC_DONE_FLAG bits are set when 
a one-shot conversion is completed. 
To exit the ADC measurement, one of following ways is 
possible to do: 
1. Set the ADC_EN bit to 0. The ADC measurement stops 
immediately. The last valid ADC measurement value can be 
read back into the ADC measurement result registers. 
2. Set all ADC function disable bits in REG0x16 to 1. The 
ADC stops after the current cycle measurement is completed. 
3. Set the ADC_RATE bit to 1. The ADC conversion can be 
set to one-shot conversion mode. The ADC stops after one 
cycle measurement is completed. 
If an adapter is plugged in, the ADC suspends, and it 
resumes after SGM41528 finishes the input source detection. 
Other than that, ADC conversion always keeps normal 
operation even a fault occurs in SGM41528.

Status Outputs Pins (nPG and nINT) 
Power Good Indication (nPG) 
When a good input source is connected to VBUS and input 
type is detected, the PG_STAT status bit goes high and the 
nPG pin goes low. A good input source is detected if all the 
following conditions on VVBUS are satisfied and input type 
detection is completed: 
• VVBUS is in the operating range: VVBUS_UVLOZ < VVBUS < VVBUS_OV. 
• Input source is not poor: VVBUS > VBAD_SRC (3.6V TYP) when 
IBAD_SRC (7.6mA TYP) loading is applied. (Poor source 
detection.) 
• Completed input source type detection. 
 
nINT Interrupt Output Pin 
When a new update occurs in the charger states, a 256μs 
negative pulse is sent through the nINT pin to interrupt the 
host. The host may not continuously monitor the charger 
device and by receiving the interrupt, it can react and check 
the charger situation on time. By default, each of the following 
events will generate a nINT pulse. 
1. Good input power source detected. 
a) VVBUS < VVBUS_OV 
b) VVBUS > VBAD_SRC when IBAD_SRC current is applied  
2. Good input power source removed. 
3. Entering junction temperature regulation. 
4. Entering VINDPM regulation. 
5. Entering IINDPM regulation. 
6. Watchdog timer expired. 
7. VBUS_STAT[2:0] bits change. 
8. TS_STAT[2:0] bits change. 
9. CHRG_STAT[2:0] bits change, including charge complete. 
10. A rising edge on any of the *_STAT bits of REG0x0B to 
REG0x0E. 
11. Battery over-voltage detected. 
12. Junction temperature shutdown. 
13. VBUS over-voltage detected. 
14. Charge safety timer expired, including pre-charge timer 
expired. 
If the event mask bit is set to 1, the corresponding nINT pulse 
does not send out when the event happens. For each event, 
there are three related bits:  
1. STAT bit: holding the current status. 
2. FLAG bit: holding nINT event information, ignore the 
current status. 
3. MASK bit: prevent the event from sending out nINT. 
When each of the above events occurs, the SGM41528 
sends out a nINT pulse and reports the event source through 
the corresponding FLAG registers. After the host reads the 
FLAG register bits, they are automatically reset to 0, and to 
re-assert the FLAG requires a new rising edge on STAT bit.

For example, if EN_ILIM = 1 and the IINDPM[4:0] register is 
3A , a 750Ω resistor is connected between ILIM and ground, 
the actual input current limit is clamped to 1.38A (KILIM = 1035 
TYP). When ILIM pin voltage is higher than 0.8V, the 
SGM41528 clamps the input current and enters input current 
regulation. The same behavior as entering IINDPM through 
IINDPM[4:0] register, the IINDPM_STAT and IINDPM_FLAG 
bits are also set and SGM41528 reports a nINT if the 
IINDPM_MASK bit is 0.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
When EN_ILIM = 1 and the input current is not clamped by 
ILIM pin, the ILIM pin voltage (VILIM, lower than 0.8V) is 
proportional to the actual input current. In this case, the input 
current can be monitored and calculated by:

(4) 
For example, with a 750Ω ILIM resistor, the 0.4V ILIM voltage 
corresponds to 0.69A input current. If ILIM pin is shorted to 
GND, the ILIM won't help on limiting the input current and the 
limit is set by the IINDPM[4:0] register. If ILIM pin is open, the 
ILIM voltage will float above 0.8V, and the input current is 
limited to zero. 
Setting EN_ILIM bit to 0 can disable the ILIM pin clamping 
function as well as the input current monitoring function. 
Either enable or disable ILIM pin function operation takes 
effect immediately.  
 
SGM41528 Protection Features 
Monitoring of Voltage and Current 
During the converter operation, the input and system voltages 
(VVBUS and VSYS) and switch currents are constantly 
monitored to assure safe operation of the device in both Buck 
and Boost modes, as will be explained below. 
 
Boost Mode Voltage and Current Monitoring 
1. Input Under-Voltage (VBUS_UVP) 
The Boost converter stops switching once VBUS voltage falls 
below VBAD_SRC during operation. During VBUS under-voltage, 
the PG_STAT and PG_FLAG bits can be set, and a nINT 
pulse is asserted to notify the host. When the under-voltage 
condition disappears, the device automatically resumes 
switching.  
2. Input Over-Voltage (VBUS_OVP) 
The input voltage range for Boost mode operation is above 
VBAD_SRC and below VVBUS_OV. Converter switching will stop as 
soon as VBUS voltage exceeds VVBUS_OV over-voltage limit. 
During VBUS over-voltage, the SGM41528 sets the 
VBUS_OVP_STAT and VBUS_OVP_FLAG bits, and reports a 
nINT pulse if the VBUS_OVP_MASK bit is set to 0. When the 
over-voltage condition disappears, the Boost converter 
automatically resumes switching again. 
3. System Over-Voltage (SYSOVP) 
During a system load transient, the device clamps the system 
voltage to protect the system components from over-voltage. 
The SYSOVP threshold is related to the battery voltage. 
When VBAT < VSYS_MIN, the SYSOVP threshold is VSYS_MIN + 
360mV; when VBAT > VSYS_MIN, the SYSOVP is VBAT + 440mV. 
Once a SYSOVP occurs, switching stops to clamp any 
overshoot and a 16mA sink current is applied to SYS to pull 
the voltage down. 
4. System Over-Current (SYSOCP) 
To protect system from overloading or short-circuit event, the 
device continually compares VSYS to VVBUS. If the IINDPM is 
triggered and the heavy load further cause the SYS voltage 
drop to below VBUS voltage more than 250mV, the SGM41528 
stops switching and automatically tries to resume from this 
fault condition. If 7 consecutive retry failures are detected, the 
EN_HIZ bit is set automatically. The SGM41528 sets the 
SYS_SHORT_FLAG and reports a nINT to host if the 
SYS_SHORT_MASK is 0. 
 
OTG Buck Mode Voltage and Current Monitoring 
In Buck mode, the QBLK (blocking FET) and LSFET (low-side 
switch) FET currents and VBUS voltage are monitored for 
protection. 
1. Output Over-Voltage Protection for VBUS 
In Buck mode, converter stops switching and exits Buck 
mode (by clearing EN_OTG bit) if VBUS voltage rises above 
regulation and exceeds the VOTG_OVP over-voltage limit (6.03V 
TYP). A nINT pulse is sent and the OTG_FLAG bit is set high. 
2. Output Over-Current Protection for VBUS 
In OTG Buck mode, when OTG output current is higher than 
OTG_ILIM[3:0] bits and VBUS drops to lower than VBAD_SRC, 
the Buck converter stops switching. The device automatically 
tries to resume from this fault condition. After 7 consecutive 
retry failures, the EN_OTG bit is cleared, the OTG_FLAG bit 
is set, and a nINT is pulsed to notify the host.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
SGM41528 Thermal Regulation and Shutdown 
Boost Mode Thermal Protections 
Internal junction temperature (TJ) is always monitored to 
avoid overheating. A limit of +120 ℃ is considered for 
maximum IC surface temperature in Boost mode and if TJ 
intends to exceed this level, the device reduces the charge 
current to keep maximum temperature limited to +120℃ 
(thermal regulation mode) and sets the TREG_STAT bit to 1. 
As expected, the charging current is always lower than 
programmed value under thermal regulation conditions. The 
safety timer runs at half clock rate, and the charge termination 
is 
disabled. 
The 
thermal 
regulation 
temperature 
is 
programmable from +60℃ to +120℃ with 20℃ step.  
If the junction temperature exceeds TSHUT (+150℃), thermal 
shutdown protection arise in which the converter is turned off, 
the SGM41528 sets the TSHUT_STAT and TSHUT_FLAG bits, 
and reports a nINT pulse if the TSHUT_MASK bit is set to 0. 
When the device recovers and TJ falls below the hysteresis 
band of TSHUT_HYS (30℃ under TSHUT), the converter resumes 
automatically. 
If the charge is disabled, the thermal regulation mode doesn't 
work, but the thermal shutdown protection keeps work. 
 
OTG Buck Mode Thermal Protections 
Similar to Boost mode, TJ is monitored in OTG Buck mode for 
thermal shutdown protection. If junction temperature exceeds 
TSHUT (+150℃), the Buck mode stops switching and the 
EN_OTG bit is reset to 0 automatically. Similarly, the 
SGM41528 sets the TSHUT_STAT and TSHUT_FLAG bits, 
and reports a nINT pulse if the TSHUT_MASK bit is set to 0. If 
TJ falls below the hysteresis band of TSHUT_HYS (30℃ under 
TSHUT), the Buck mode can recover again by re-enabling 
EN_OTG bit by the host. 
 
Battery Protections 
Battery Over-Voltage Protection (BATOVP) 
The over-voltage protection threshold of the battery pin is 4% 
above the programmed battery regulation voltage (VREG) 
during charging phase. In case of a BATOVP, charging stops 
right away, the SGM41528 sets the BATOVP_STAT and 
BATOVP_FLAG bits, and reports a nINT pulse if the 
BATOVP_MASK bit is set to 0. 
 
I2C Serial Interface and Data Communication 
Standard I2C interface is used to program SGM41528 
parameters and get status reports. I2C is well known 2-wire 
serial communication interface that can connect one (or more) 
master device(s) to some slave devices for two-way 
communication. The bus lines are named serial data (SDA) 
and serial clock (SCL). The device that initiates a data 
transfer is a master. A master generates the SCL signal. 
Slave devices have unique addresses to identify. A master is 
typically a micro controller or a digital signal processor. 
The SGM41528 operates as a slave device with address 
0x6B (6BH). It has 38 8-bit registers, numbered from 
REG0x00 to REG0x25. A register read beyond REG0x25 
(0x25) returns 0xFF. 
 
Physical Layer 
The standard I2C interface of SGM41528 supports standard 
mode and fast mode communication speeds. The frequency 
of stand mode is up to 100kbits/s, while the fast mode is up to 
400kbits/s. Bus lines are pulled high by weak current source 
or pull-up resistors are in logic high state with no clocking 
when the bus is free. The SDA and SCL pins are open-drain.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
I2C Data Communication 
START and STOP Conditions 
A transaction is started by taking control of the bus by master 
if the bus is free. The transaction is terminated by releasing 
the bus when the data transfer job is done as shown in Figure 
13. All transactions begin by the master who applies a START 
condition on the bus lines to take over the bus and exchange 
data. In the end, the master terminates the transaction by 
applying one (or more) STOP condition. START condition is 
defined when SCL is high and a high-to-low transition on the 
SDA is generated by master. Similarly, a STOP is defined 
when SCL is high and SDA goes from low to high. After a 
START and before a STOP, the bus is considered busy. BTW, 
only a master can send out the START and STOP signals.

Data Bit Transmission and Validity 
Data bit (high or low) must remain stable during clock HIGH 
period. The state of SDA can only change when SCL is LOW. 
For each data bit transmission, one clock pulse is generated 
by the master. Bit transfer in I2C is shown in Figure 14.

Figure 14. I2C Bus Bit Transfer 
 
Byte Format 
Data is transmitted in 8-bit packets (one byte at a time). The 
number of bytes in one transaction is not limited. In each 
packet, the 8 bits are sent successively with the Most 
Significant Bit (MSB) first. An acknowledge (or not-acknowledge) 
bit must come after the 8 data bits. This bit informs the 
transmitter whether the receiver is ready to proceed for the 
next byte or not. Figure 15 shows the byte transfer process 
with I2C interface. 
 
Acknowledge (ACK) and Not Acknowledge (NCK) 
After transmission of each byte by transmitter, an 
acknowledge bit is replied by the receiver as ninth bit. With 
the acknowledge bit, the receiver informs the transmitter that 
the byte has been received, and another byte is expected or 
can be sent (ACK) or it is not expected (NCK = not ACK). 
Clock (SCL) is always generated by the master, including for 
the acknowledge ninth bit, no matter who is acting as 
transmitter or receiver. SDA line is released for receiver 
control during the acknowledge clock pulse and the receiver 
can pull the SDA line low as ACK (reply a 0 bit) or let it be high 
as NCK during the SCL high pulse. After that, the master can 
either STOP (P) to end the transaction or send a new START 
(S) condition to start a new transfer (called repeated start). 
For example, when master wants to read a register in slave, 
one start is needed to send the slave address and register 
address, and then, without a stop condition, another start is 
sent by master to initiate the receiving transaction from slave. 
Master then sends the STOP condition and releases the bus. 
 
Data Direction Bit and Addressing Slaves 
The first byte sent by master after the START is always the 
target slave address (7 bits) and an eighth data-direction bit 
(R/ W ). R/ W  bit is 0 for a WRITE transaction and 1 for READ 
(when master is asking for data). Data direction is the same 
for all next bytes of the transaction. To reverse it, a new 
START or repeated START condition must be sent by master 
(STOP will end the transaction). Usually the second byte is 
also a WRITE, sending the register address that is supposed 
to be accessed in the next byte(s). The 7-bit slave address is 
1101011b (0x6B). The address bit arrangement is shown 
below, as shown in Figure 16 and Figure 17.

WRITE: If the master wants to write in the register, the third byte can be written directly as shown in Figure 18 for a single write 
data transfer. After receiving the ACK, the master may issue a STOP condition to end the transaction or send the next register 
data, which will be written to the next address in a slave as multi-write. A STOP is needed after sending the last data.

READ: If the master wants to read a single register (Figure 19), it sends a new START condition along with device address with 
R/ W  bit = 1. After ACK is received, the master reads the SDA line to receive the content of the register. Master replies with NCK 
to inform slave that no more data is needed (single read) or it can send an ACK to request for sending the next register content 
(multi-read). This can continue until an NCK is sent by master. A STOP must be sent by master in any case to end the 
transaction.

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
The SGM41528 is typically used as a charger with power 
path management in smart phones, tablets and other portable 
devices. In the design, it comes along with a host controller (a 
processor with I2C interface) and a 2-cell Li-Ion or Li-polymer 
battery. 
 
Detailed Design Procedure 
Inductor Selection 
The inductor selection mainly considers the inductance, the 
saturation current and heat rating current. The saturation 
current and heat rating current are better to higher than the 
possible maximum current considering the inductor current 
ripple as following formula: 
 
∆
>

(5) 
The inductor ripple current (∆I) depends on input voltage 
(VVBUS), output voltage (VSYS), inductor (L) and switching 
frequency (fSW):

(6) 
An inductor with a larger value results in less ripple current 
and a lower peak inductor current, reducing stress on the 
power MOSFET. However, the larger value inductor has a 
larger physical size, a higher series resistance, and a lower 
saturation current. To trade off between the inductor power 
loss and size, it is recommended to choose the inductor ripple 
current to be approximated 20% - 40% of the maximum input 
current. 
 
VBUS and PMID Capacitor 
The effective capacitance of VBUS and PMID should be 
enough to absorb the VBUS input switching ripple current. 
The equation below shows the input capacitor RMS current 
ICIN calculation.

Low ESR ceramic capacitors are recommended for input 
capacitor. The input capacitor voltage ripple can be calculated 
as follow:

VSYS Capacitor 
The VSYS output current of the Boost converter is 
discontinuous and therefore requires an output capacitor 
(CSYS) to supply AC current to the load. Ripple current rating 
of VSYS output capacitor should be higher than the maximum 
output ripple. The output capacitor RMS current can be 
calculated by below equation and the maximum value occurs 
at 50% duty cycle.

Layout Guidelines 
The switching node (SW) creates very high frequency noises, 
which are several times higher than fSW (1.5MHz) due to 
sharp rise and fall of the voltage and current in the switches. 
To reduce the ringing issues and noise generation, it is 
important to design a proper layout for minimizing the current 
path impedance and loop area. The following considerations 
can help to make a better layout.  
1. Place all the output capacitors as close as possible to SYS 
and BAT pins. The capacitors ground pins need to be 
connected to the IC ground with GND plane or short copper 
trace connections. 
2. Place the input capacitor between PMID and GND pins as 
close as possible to the chip with shortest copper connections 
(avoid vias). Choose the smallest capacitor size. 
3. Connect one pin of the inductor as close as possible to the 
SW pin of the device and minimize the copper area 
connected to the SW node to reduce capacitive coupling from 
SW area to nearby signal traces. This decreases the noise 
induced 
through 
parasitic 
stray 
capacitances 
and 
displacement currents to other conductors. SW connection 
should be wide enough to carry the charging current. Keep 
other signals and traces away from SW if possible.

4. Place output capacitor GND pin as close as possible to the 
GND pin of the device and the GND pin of input capacitor CIN. 
It is better to avoid using vias for these connections and keep 
the high frequency current paths short enough and on the 
same layer. A GND copper layer under the component layer 
helps to reduce noise emissions. Pay attention to the DC 
current and AC current paths in the layout and keep them 
short and decoupled as much as possible. 
5. For analog signals, it is better to use a separate analog 
ground (AGND) branched only at one point from GND pin. To 
avoid high current flow through the AGND path, it should be 
connected to GND only at one point (preferably the GND pin). 
6. Place decoupling capacitors close to the IC pins with the 
shortest copper connections. 
7. Solder the exposed thermal pad of the package to the PCB 
ground planes. Ensure that there are enough thermal vias 
directly under the IC, connecting to the ground plane on the 
other layers for better heat dissipation and cooling of the 
device. 
8. Select proper sizes for the vias and ensure enough copper 
is available to carry the current for a given current path. Vias 
usually have some considerable parasitic inductance and 
resistance. 
9. Route the feedback signal BATP and BATN away from SW 
node. 
 
NOTE: If the BATN and BATP lines cannot pass under the CBAT in PCB layout, 
            please wire them through the vias and in Kelvin connection.
