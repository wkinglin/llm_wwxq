DECEMBER 2022 – REV.A 
 
GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM72322A is a double-pole/double-throw (DPDT) 
switch, which supports from 0.4GHz to 3.8GHz. The 
device features low insertion loss and high isolation, 
which make it suitable for high linearity and 2G/3G/4G 
applications. 
The SGM72322A has the ability to integrate DPDT RF 
switch and GPIO controller on an SOI chip. Internal 
driver and decoder for switch control signals are offered 
by the GPIO controller, which makes it flexible in RF 
path routing and band selection. 
No external DC blocking capacitors required on the RF 
paths as long as no external DC voltage is applied, 
which can save PCB area and cost. 
The SGM72322A is available in a Green UTQFN-2×
2-12AL package.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.
