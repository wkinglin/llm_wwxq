GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM4T245S is a 4-bit bus transceiver with 
configurable voltage translation and 3-state outputs. The 
nAn and nBn are 4-bit data input and output ports, nDIR 
is the direction control input and nOE
ത
ത
ത
ത
ത is an output 
enable input. VCCA and VCCB are dual-supply pins. The 
supply voltage of VCCA and VCCB can range from 1.2V to 
5.5V, making the device suitable for bidirectional 
translating among any of the 1.2V, 1.5V, 1.8V, 2.5V, 
3.3V and 5.5V voltage nodes. The nAn, nDIR and nOE
ത
ത
ത
ത
ത 
pins are referenced to VCCA, and nBn pins are 
referenced to VCCB. 
The direction control (nDIR) input determines the 
direction of the data flow. The nDIR (active high) 
enables data from nAn ports to nBn ports. The nDIR 
(active low) enables data from nBn ports to nAn ports. 
When the output enable (nOE
ത
ത
ത
ത
ത) input is high, both nAn 
and nBn ports are disabled, so the buses are effectively 
isolated. 
This device is highly suitable for partial power-down 
applications using power-off leakage current (IOFF) circuit. 
When the device is powered down, the current backflow 
will be prevented from passing through the device. 
 
 
FEATURES 
● VCCA Supply Voltage Range: 1.2V to 5.5V 
● VCCB Supply Voltage Range: 1.2V to 5.5V 
● Inputs Accept Voltages Higher than the Supply 
Voltage 
● +20mA/-20mA Output Current 
● Outputs in High-Impedance State when VCCA or 
VCCB = 0V 
● -40℃ to +125℃ Operating Temperature Range 
● Available in Green TSSOP-16 and TQFN-2.6×1.8-16L

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
1. Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may 
affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
2. The input and output voltage ratings may be exceeded if 
the input and output clamp current ratings are observed. 
3. The performance capability of a high-performance integrated 
circuit in conjunction with its thermal environment can create 
junction temperatures which are detrimental to reliability. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.

NOTES: 
1. CPD is used to determine the dynamic power dissipation (PD in μW). 
PD = CPD × VCC
2 × fi × N + Σ(CL × VCC
2 × fo) 
where: 
fi = Input frequency in MHz. 
fo = Output frequency in MHz. 
CL = Output load capacitance in pF. 
VCC = Supply voltage in Volts. 
N = Number of inputs switching. 
Σ(CL × VCC
2 × fo) = Sum of the outputs. 
2. Per transceiver, fi = 10MHz, tR = tF = 1ns, CL = 0pF.
