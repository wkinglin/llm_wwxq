GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM2537 family is a compact electronic fuse 
(eFuse) with circuit protection functions, which can be 
used as a solution to power management. The FET 
hot-swap device is also highly integrated in a small 
package. With very few external components, the 
SGM2537 can provide multiple protection modes. To 
encounter overloads, voltage surges, short-circuits and 
high inrush current, the device is suitable as a robust 
defense. 
A single external resistor can be used to set the output 
current limit, and after detecting the voltage drop 
across the resistor, it is possible to monitor the load 
current accurately. Also, a single external capacitor is 
enough to set the output slew rate for applications with 
particular inrush current requirements. Using internal 
clamping circuits alone can quickly limit over-voltage 
events to a fixed maximum value within a safe range. 
The SGM2537-PRN variant provides an option to set a 
user-defined over-voltage cutoff threshold. 
The SGM2537 is available in a Green TDFN-2×2-8AL 
package.

NOTES: 
1. It is recommended to limit the nominal input voltage 
according to the output clamp voltage.  
2. When supply voltages are below 6V, the EN/UVLO and IN 
pins can be connected directly. When supply voltages exceed 
6V, a suitable resistor divider should be used from IN, 
EN/UVLO to GND pin. This resistor is used to guarantee that 
the EN/UVLO pin voltage is within the set limits. 
3. Guaranteed by design, not by tests at production. 
 
OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.

SGM2537 is an integrated eFuse, which ensures the 
safety of the power delivery system due to its rich 
features. The device has many user- or factory-adjustable 
settings to suit the needs of different application 
scenarios. The device can be used to protect 
downstream equipment from input voltage fluctuations 
and over-current events, while a thermal shutdown 
mechanism is integrated to protect the device itself 
during fault conditions. 
 
Under-Voltage Protection (UVP) and 
Under-Voltage Lockout (UVLO) 
SGM2537 implements under-voltage protection at IN 
pin to prevent IN voltage from being too low for normal 
operation of system and equipment. A fixed locking 
threshold voltage (VUVP) is provided inside the device 
for under-voltage protection. During start-up, if the VIN 
voltage exceeds VUVP(R), the device turns on the FET. 
During the on-process, if the VIN voltage is lower than 
VUVP(F), the device shuts down the FET. There is a 
hysteresis between the rising threshold and falling 
threshold of UVP. 
For the SGM2537, the UVLO comparator on the 
EN/UVLO pin can be used to set the user-adjustable 
under-voltage lockout threshold through the external 
resistance voltage divider. Figure 2 shows how to set 
the specific value of under-voltage lockout threshold 
using an external resistance voltage divider. There is a 
hysteresis between the rising threshold and falling 
threshold of UVLO.

Over-Voltage Protection 
The SGM2537 devices provide two ways to implement 
input over-voltage protection. 
Over-Voltage Lockout (OVLO) 
The SGM2537-xRN can implement user-programmable 
input over-voltage threshold through an external 
resistor divider. When the power supply voltage 
exceeds a certain level, the device turns off the supply 
to the load. The resistance divider feeds the divided 
voltage of the power supply to the nEN/OVLO pin. 
When the voltage at the nEN/OVLO pin exceeds the 
threshold VOVLO, the FET is disabled. When the voltage 
at the nEN/OVLO pin falls below the threshold, the FET 
is turned ON. 
The user needs to determine the appropriate resistance 
divider in order to correctly map the over-voltage 
threshold of the input voltage to the internal threshold 
VOVLO.

Over-Voltage Clamp (OVC) 
The SGM2537-3.8x/3.8RD, SGM2537-5.7x/5.7RD/5.7RN 
and SGM2537-13.7x devices provide the over-voltage 
clamp (OVC) function which continuously monitors the 
input voltage and ensures the output clamp voltage to 
VCLAMP level within a very short time tOVC once the input 
voltage exceeds the over-voltage clamp threshold 
VOVC.  
When the input voltage falls below the over-voltage 
clamp threshold VOVC, the clamp will release the output 
voltage, which can protect the safety of output device, 
and continuous output clamping condition usually 
results in thermal shutdown as shown in Figure 4. Once 
the junction temperature exceeds +156℃, the power 
MOSFET will be turned off by the thermal shutdown 
circuitry. For SGM2537-xL, if the power supply or 
EN/UVLO is reset (pulled low and then pulled up), the 
device tries to turn on the power MOSFET again. For 
SGM2537-xR/xRD/xRN, the device is designed with an 
auto-retry cycle after device temperature drops by THYS 
and an additional delay of tTSD_RST. Unless the fault is 
removed, the auto-retry cycle will be continued.

Response (Auto-Retry) 
As is shown in SELECTABLE MODEL, multiple device 
options apply to different clamping voltage thresholds. 
 
Inrush Current, Over-Current and 
Short-Circuit Protections 
SGM2537 adopts three levels of forward over-current 
protection function: 
1. Adjustable slew rate (SS) for inrush current protection. 
2. Adjust threshold (ILIM) for over-current in steady state 
or start-up. 
3. Adjust threshold (ISC) for severe over-current such as 
hard short-circuits in steady state or start-up. 
 
Slew Rate and Inrush Current Control (SS) 
When hot plugging or system charging large capacitive 
load occurs, the equipment power path will generate a 
large inrush current. The inrush current is proportional 
to the load capacitance and the output voltage slew 
rate. For a given load capacitance COUT, the 
relationship between the slew rate (SRON) and inrush 
current (IINRUSH) is shown in Equation 2.

The slew rate can be controlled by connecting a

calculated by Equation 3.

Active Current Limit 
The device will actively monitor the load current in both 
start-up and normal mode. When the load current rises 
to the over-current threshold ILIMIT set by RILIM, the 
device adjusts the FET to restrict the load current to 
ILIMIT in the time of tLIM. When the load current falls 
below the current limit, the device exits the current limit. 
Given a desired current limit ILIMIT, the value of RILIM can 
be calculated from Equation 4.

During the active current limit, there is more power 
dissipation on the device because the output voltage 
drops. If the internal temperature (TJ) of the device 
exceeds the thermal shutdown threshold (TSD), the FET 
will be turned off, and the device will either be latched 
off (SGM2537-xL) or restarted automatically after a 
certain time interval (SGM2537-xR/xRD/xRN) as 
shown in the OTP section.

Short-Circuit Protection 
When a serious over-current event similar to a 
short-circuit event occurs, the SGM2537 triggers a 
fast-trip response and limits the current to ILIMIT in order 
to prevent the system from being damaged by 
excessive current flowing through the device. When the 
current falls below the current limit ILIMIT, the device 
exits the current limit. If the fault persists, the device 
continues to operate in the current limit mode, causing 
the internal temperature of the device to rise until the 
thermal shutdown. Thereafter, the device will either be 
latched off (SGM2537-xL) or restarted automatically 
after a certain time interval (SGM2537-xR/xRD/xRN) as 
shown in the OTP section.

Over-Temperature Protection (OTP) 
The SGM2537 always monitors the temperature (TJ) of 
the internal die. Once the internal temperature exceeds 
the thermal shutdown threshold (TSD), the device shuts 
down immediately. When SGM2537-xL triggers the 
thermal shutdown, it still remains in the shutdown state 
unless the equipment is power cycled or re-enabled. 
When SGM2537-xR/xRD/xRN triggers the thermal 
shutdown, it remains in the shutdown state until the 
internal temperature of the equipment drops by THYS. 
After that, it will retry to turn on automatically after a tRST 
delay time if it is still enabled. See Table 1.

Quick Output Discharge (QOD) 
Some applications require the output capacitor to be 
discharged quickly when the eFuse is turned off, so that 
downstream devices will not take unexpected actions 
due to slow discharge of the output capacitor. 
SGM2537-xRD internally integrates the Quick Output 
Discharge function, which can be enabled by 
connecting the OUT pin to the QOD pin. The QOD pin 
has an internal FET to provide a fast discharge path. 
Initially the FET operates in the saturation region and 
causes a constant current discharge in the output 
capacitor. The FET then operates in the linear region, 
where the output capacitor discharges through an 
equivalent resistance. 
The QOD function of the chip can be equivalent to an 
RC discharge circuit to simplify the analysis. Among 
them, the discharge time of the output capacitor is the 
same as the charging time of the output capacitor 
under the same conditions. The discharge resistor 
RQOD is the equivalent resistance of the FET when it is 
used for discharge. It takes 5 times the time constant (τ 
= R×C) to discharge the capacitor voltage to 0.7% of 
the initial value. For example, when the equivalent 
QOD resistance is 15Ω, the time required to discharge 
a 100μF output capacitor from 5V to 35mV can be 
calculated by Equation 5.

For ILIMIT = 3.7A, according to Equation 5, RILIM = 544Ω. 
Using the closest standard 1% resistor values, RILIM = 
549Ω is chosen. 
Under-Voltage Lockout Set Point 
The supply under-voltage lockout (UVLO) threshold is 
set by a resistor divider connected to the EN/UVLO pin. 
This threshold can be calculated from Equation 7:

Where VUVLO_R is the rising threshold (1.2V) of the 
EN/UVLO pin. R1 and R2 are the resistors of the 
resistor divider. Since R1 and R2 cause additional 
leakage current to flow out of the input voltage, their 
values need to be taken into account for the acceptable 
leakage current of the system. The leakage current 
flowing through R1 and R2 from the supply is IR12 = 
VIN/(R1 + R2). Considering that an external active 
device connected to a resistor divider causes additional 
leakage current, this increases the calculation error of 
the supply under-voltage threshold. Therefore, the 
leakage current flowing through R1 and R2 (IR12) should 
be greater than 20 times the leakage current expected 
by the EN/UVLO pin. 
According to the application scenario requirements, 
VUVR = 4.3V. Given R1 = 1MΩ, R2 = 387kΩ can be 
obtained according to the above equation.

APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued) 
Setting Output Voltage Ramp Time (tSS) 
During the design process, it must be ensured that the 
junction temperature of the device does not meet the 
thermal shutdown threshold under either start-up or 
steady-state conditions. Given that the power stress to 
which the device is subjected at start-up is typically an 
order of magnitude greater than under steady-state 
conditions, the determination of start-up time and 
inrush current limit is particularly important to avoid 
thermal shutdown at start-up. There are two possible 
cases to discuss during start-up: 
 
Case 1: Start-Up without Load. Output Capacitance 
Draws Current 
During start-up, the voltage stress of the FET 
decreases as the output capacitor voltage increases. 
Use Equation 8 to calculate the average power 
dissipated on the device.

and Load Draw Current 
If the load keeps drawing current from the power supply 
during start-up, the power dissipated on the device will 
be greater. Assuming that the system has a resistive 
load, Equations 10 to 13 give the power dissipated by 
the resistive load during the start-up of the device.

Quick Output Discharge Using SGM2537-xRD 
When the SGM2537-xRD is disabled, the internal FET is turned off and the OUT pin is left floating, where the OUT 
voltage drop process is determined by the external load. In some applications, this can cause downstream 
equipment to be in an unpredictable state because the OUT voltage is in an undesired state. Connect the QOD pin 
to the OUT pin to realize the Fast Output Discharge function of the SGM2537-xRD, as shown in Figure 16. When the 
SGM2537-xRD is disabled via EN, the QOD pin is pulled low and provides a fast discharge path for the output 
capacitor. The output voltage discharge rate is determined by the output capacitance, the total resistance of the 
discharge path (internal plus external), and the external load.

Over-Voltage Lockout Using SGM2537-PRN 
The SGM2537-PRN implements the input over-voltage protection via a resistor divider circuit, which is connected 
from the supply to the nEN/OVLO pin to GND (as shown in Figure 19) to achieve a programmable over-voltage 
threshold. When the divided voltage on the nEN/OVLO exceeds VOVLO, the device turns off the internal FET and 
protects the downstream load.

APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued) 
Power Supply Recommendations 
The SGM2537 devices are suitable for a supply voltage 
from 2.7V to 18V. If the input supply is more than a few 
inches away from the device, it is recommended to 
place an input bypass ceramic capacitor greater than 
0.1μF. The rated current of the power supply must be 
greater than the over-current threshold set by the 
device, otherwise the supply voltage will drop in the 
event of an over-current or short-circuit. 
 
Transient Protection 
In the case of a short-circuit or over-current limit, the 
device may cut off the current, and due to the parasitic 
inductance in series at the input and output of the 
device, a positive voltage spike will occur at the input 
and output, and a negative voltage spike will occur at 
the output. The amplitude of the voltage spike is 
determined by the parasitic inductance. These 
transients can cause the voltage on the device pins to 
exceed their maximum absolute rating if the following 
measures are not taken: 
● The length of the wires at the input and output of the 
device is as small as possible. 
● A TVS diode is paralleled at the input port of the 
device to absorb a positive voltage spike, and a 
Schottky diode is connected in parallel to the output 
port to absorb a negative voltage spike. 
● Choose a large PCB GND plane. 
● Connect a low ESR ceramic capacitor larger than 
1μF near the output pin. 
● A ceramic capacitor CIN in the range from 0.001μF 
to 0.1μF is connected near the input pin to absorb 
and suppress transient voltage spikes and ringing. 
Use Equation 18 to calculate the input capacitance 
value.

Where VIN is the rating of the input voltage, ILOAD is the 
load current, LIN is the effective inductance seen 
looking into the source, and CIN is the capacitance of 
the input.

APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued) 
Output Short-Circuit Measurements 
The output short-circuit waveform may be affected by 
factors such as input leads, power supply bypass, 
layout, device selection, circuit location, and output 
short-circuit method. It is difficult to obtain repeatable 
and similar output short-circuit test results. Therefore, 
the short-circuit results in this datasheet are for 
informational purposes only. Different short-circuit test 
results may be achieved because of different test 
conditions. 
 
Layout Guidelines 
● In any application, it is recommended to connect a 
0.1μF or greater decoupling capacitor between IN 
and GND. This decoupling capacitor should be as 
close as possible to the IN and GND pins to 
minimize 
the 
area 
of 
the 
IN-decoupling 
capacitor-GND loop. 
● The power path should be as wide and short as 
possible, with a current-carrying capacity of more 
than twice the device's current limit. 
● The GND pin of the device must be connected to 
PCB ground which is a copper plane or island as 
short as possible. 
● In order to achieve the accuracy of the eFuse 
function, it is recommended to provide the eFuse 
with a ground plane that does not flow through large 
currents. The ground plane of the device is 
connected to the ground plane of the system via a 
star connection. 
● External components of the device as follows 
should be placed as close to the corresponding pins 
as possible: 
1. RILIM 
2. CSS 
3. Resistor dividers of EN/UVLO 
● The other end of these components is connected to 
ground via the shortest possible path. The ILIM pin 
should have a parasitic capacitance of less than 
50pF, and the connection path of this pin should be 
away from the switching signal. 
● Protection components such as TVS, snubbers, 
capacitors or Schottky diodes should be connected 
to the device via a short path to avoid large line 
inductance. It is important to note that the loop area 
formed by the protection components should be as 
small as possible.
