GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM61032 is a high efficiency and miniature size 
synchronous Buck converter for low input voltage 
applications. It is a perfect solution for compact designs. 
The 2.5V to 5.5V input voltage range is suitable for 
almost all available battery-powered applications. It 
operates in PWM mode at 1.5MHz (TYP) in the 
medium to heavy load range and automatically enters 
or exits the power-save mode (PSM) at light loads to 
maintain its high efficiency. During shutdown, the 
quiescent current is 0.02µA (TYP). 
This device is based on an adaptive off-time 
architecture, but still allows a wide range of output 
capacitors from 10μF to 150μF and even more. This 
flexibility makes the device a good choice for system 
power rails supply. It also supports 100% duty cycle 
operation and enters path-through mode (PTM) when 
certain conditions are met. At this mode, the quiescent 
current is reduced to 32μA. The adaptive off-time 
architecture provides excellent output voltage accuracy 
and superb load transient response. Only external 
feedforward compensation capacitor is needed to 
obtain faster response. 
The SGM61032 is available in a Green SOT-563-6 
package.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
Overview 
The SGM61032 is a high efficiency Buck switching 
converter optimized for handheld battery-powered 
applications. It operates at a quasi-fixed frequency of 
1.5MHz and uses adaptive off-time PWM control for the 
moderate to heavy load range. This allows using a 
small inductor and small capacitors for compact 
designs.  
At light load conditions, SGM61032 operates in 
power-save mode to reduce the switching frequency 
and losses for longer battery life. The power-save 
mode quiescent current is 45μA (TYP) and the 
quiescent current can reduce to 32μA (TYP) at 
path-through mode. 
Under-Voltage Lockout (UVLO) 
Operating with insufficient supply voltage can cause 
device malfunction or failure. The UVLO protection 
shuts down the device if the input voltage is below the 
VUVLO threshold. The VUVLO hysteresis is 210mV. When 
the input voltage exceeds the rising UVLO threshold, the 
device restarts with a fresh soft startup sequence.  
Device Enable and the Output Discharge 
FET 
When the input voltage is valid, pulling the EN input to 
logic high to enable the device and pulling it low to shut 
it down. In the shutdown mode, the switches and all 
control circuits are turned off to reduce the device 
current to 0.02μA (TYP). During shutdown, an internal 
FET (16Ω typical on-resistance) is turned on and 
connects the SW pin to the GND for smooth discharge 
of the output. This discharge function is also activated 
when the shutdown is caused by a thermal shutdown, 
UVLO, output OVP (VOVP_RISING = 110% (TYP) × VREF, 
VOVP_FALLING = 105% (TYP) × VREF) or short-circuit 
protection. 
Power Good (PG) 
PG is an open-drain output with 1mA sinking capability. 
This pin should be pulled up with an external resistor to 
a logic high rail which is no more than 5.5V unless it is 
not used. The PG signal is in high-impedance state 
when the output voltage is in regulation range. PG 
remains low until VOUT exceeds 95% of its nominal (set) 
value and goes low if VOUT drops below 90% of its 
nominal value. Table 1 shows how the PG state is 
changed in different conditions. VPG is the threshold of 
the PG hysteretic comparator. It has a 5% hysteresis 
band and goes high when VFB rises above 95% of the 
VREF. 
The PG output is useful for power supply sequencing 
as well. Usually, the multiple power rails of a system 
need to be powered in a specific sequence for proper 
startup. The PG output of the leading power supply is 
connected to the EN input of the subsequent power 
supply to implement such sequencing.

NOTE: 1. When working in path-through mode, PG Logic is 
High-Z. 
 
Soft-Start and Pre-biased Startup 
When the device is enabled, the output voltage is 
ramped up towards its nominal value by an internal 
soft-start circuit with a rate determined by the startup 
time (tSS). This circuit slowly ramps up the error 
amplifier reference voltage (VREF = 0.6V) after exiting 
the shutdown state or under-voltage lockout (UVLO). 
The soft-start is critical to prevent excessive inrush 
currents and to avoid triggering of the output 
over-current protection to provide a smooth output rise. 
It also prevents extreme input voltage drops due to 
large inrush current over the high-impedance batteries 
and input sources that can interrupt the power-up. 
The SGM61032 is also capable of starting with a 
pre-biased output capacitor when it is powered up or 
enabled. When the device is turned on, a bias on the 
output can exist due to the other sources connected to 
the load(s) such as multi-voltage ICs or simply because 
of residual charges on the output capacitors. For 
example, when a device with light load is disabled and 
re-enabled, the output can not drop during the off 
period and the device must restart under pre-biased 
output condition. Without the pre-biased capability, the 
device can not be able to start up properly. The output 
ramp is automatically initiated with the bias voltage and 
ramps up to the nominal output value.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Power-Save Mode (PSM) 
At light load conditions, the SGM61032 shifts to the 
power-save mode to reduce the switching frequency 
and minimize the losses. It also shuts down most of 
the internal circuits in power-save mode. In this mode, 
one or more PWM pulses are sent to charge the 
output capacitor and then the switches are kept off. 
The output capacitor voltage gradually drops due to 
small load current and when it falls below the nominal 
voltage threshold, the PWM pulses resume. If the 
load is still low, the output goes slightly higher than 
normal again and the switches are turned off. In 
power-save mode, the output voltage is slightly higher 
than nominal output voltage. This effect can be 
mitigated by a larger output capacitor. 
Low Dropout Operation with 100% Duty 
Cycle 
When the input voltage gradually drops to the 
regulation output voltage, the SGM61032 can operate 
at 100% duty cycle and keep the high-side MOSFET 
continuously on for minimal input-to-output voltage 
difference. The low-side MOSFET is kept off. In this 
mode, the lowest input voltage for keeping the output 
regulated is determined by load current and the 
resistive drops from the input to the output as given in 
Equation 1:

      (1) 
where: 
VIN_MIN is minimum input voltage to maintain output 
voltage in regulation. 
IOUT_MAX is maximum output current. 
RDSON is high-side MOSFET on-resistance. 
RL is inductor DC resistance (DCR). 
 
Path-Through Mode 
When FB voltage is lower than VREF, load current is 
less than 2A and high-side MOSFET is kept on for 
more than 100μs and the device stops switching and 
keeps 
high-side 
MOSFET 
on 
constantly. 
All 
unneeded circuits are shut down for reducing the 
quiescent current to 32μA (excluding the current 
flowing through the feedback resistor). It can greatly 
reduce the power consumption at light load and 
increase the operating time of battery application. 
When the FB voltage reaches to the internal 
reference voltage or the load current is larger than 2A, 
the SGM61032 resumes regulating mode. 
Switch Current Limits and Short-Circuit 
Protection (Hiccup) 
Limiting the switch current protects the switch itself 
and also prevents over-current in the source and the 
inductor. If the high-side (HS) switch current exceeds 
the ILIM threshold, HS switch is turned off and the 
low-side (LS) switch is turned on to reduce the 
inductor current and limit the peak. 
If 32 cycles consecutive repetition of this event occurs, 
the current limit is half reduced for the next 32 cycles 
and then if the over-current continues, the device 
stops switching and turns the output discharge circuit 
on. A new startup is initiated automatically (hiccup) 
after 500μs (TYP). The hiccup repeats until the 
overload or short-circuit fault is cleared. 
Thermal Protection and Shutdown 
Thermal protection is included to protect the die 
against 
overheating 
damage. 
If 
the 
junction 
temperature exceeds TJSD threshold, the switching is 
stopped and the device is shut down. An automatic 
recovery with a soft-start begins when the junction 
cools down for 25℃ below the TJSD limit.

Input Capacitor Selection 
High frequency decoupling input capacitors with low 
ESR are needed to circulate and absorb the high 
frequency switching currents of the converter. Place 
this capacitor right beside the VIN and GND pins. A 
10μF ceramic capacitor with X5R or better dielectric 
and 0805 or smaller size is sufficient in most cases. A 
larger value can be selected to reduce the input current 
ripple. 
Inductor Selection 
The inductor current ripple is determined by the 
inductance value (L). A lower inductance results in 
higher 
peak-to-peak current that increases the 
converter conduction losses. On the other hand, a large 
inductance results in slower transient response and 
larger size. ISAT should be higher than IL_MAX, and 
sufficient margin should be reserved. Generally, the 
saturation current above high-side current limit is 
enough. Typically, the peak-to-peak inductor current is 
selected between 20% and 40% of the maximum 
output current. Equation 2 can be used to choose the 
inductance value based on ∆IL.

where:

fSW is switching frequency (MHz).  
L is the inductance value (µH).

First choose R2 value below 100kΩ to avoid high noise 
sensitivity on the FB pin. Do not choose a very small 
value for R2 otherwise the loss will be increased on this 
resistor that reduces the light load efficiency. 
LC Filter 
The inductor (L) and the output capacitor (C) form a 
low-pass filter for removing switching AC components 
and passing the DC voltage to the output. Table 4 lists 
some suitable high frequency inductor and ceramic 
capacitor combinations that can be applied for most 
applications. Note that variations as high as +20% to 
-30% in the effective inductance due to tolerances. 
Similarly, for the COUT, due to tolerances and bias 
voltage derating the effective capacitance can vary by 
+20% to -50%. For lower ripple at small output voltages 
(< 1.8V), a larger output capacitance is needed (at least 
22µF). 
A feedforward capacitor improves transient response to 
the load steps and reduces the output ripple in PSM. A 
10pF capacitor is recommended for the 1.8V output in 
the typical application.

NOTES:  
1. If VOUT is close to VIN, a 0.47µH inductor is recommended 
to improve stability. The 0.47µH inductor can use the same 
COUT/CFF combination as the 1µH inductor. 
2. Not be soldered. 
Thermal Considerations 
Especial care must be taken for power dissipation and 
thermal relief in high power density designs. The 
SGM61032 is a low-profile and fine-pitch surface- 
mount package that is typically used in a small area or 
volume. Thermal coupling, airflow and heat sinking 
must be considered in the system level and the space 
between heat generating elements must be managed 
properly. 
To enhance the thermal performance, the PCB itself 
has a significant role and to help transfer the heat away 
by using large copper traces/planes that are connected 
to the device pins (and thermal pads if present). 
Considering a proper airflow in the system can 
complete the thermal relief for reliable operation of the 
power supply. 
Layout Guidelines 
A critical component of a high frequency switching 
power supply is the PCB layout. A good layout can 
improve the overall performance of the system and a 
poor layout can result in stability issues and EMI 
problems. The following guidelines are provided for 
designing a power supply layout with the SGM61032. 
• Place the input/output capacitors and the inductor as 
close as possible to the IC pins and keep the power 
traces short. Use direct and wide traces for routing 
power paths to assure low trace parasitic resistance 
and inductance. 
• Connect the ground returns of the input and output 
capacitors close to the GND pin and at the same 
point to avoid a ground potential shift and to minimize 
high frequency current path. 
• Keep the output voltage sense trace and FB pin 
connections away from the high frequency and noisy 
conductors such as power traces and SW node to 
avoid magnetic and electric noise coupling. 
• Use GND planes in mid-layers for shielding and 
minimizing the ground potential drifts.
