GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM42622B is a low voltage stepper motor driver 
with control logic and low RDSON MOSFET power stages 
all integrated in a small TQFN package. 
This device uses fixed off-time PWM current control for 
two independent H-bridges and is capable for fine 
microstepping resolution up to 1/256. Aimed for battery- 
powered applications, it can go to near zero-power 
standby mode for increased battery life. 
A full set of protection features are provided including 
over-current, short-circuit, and thermal shutdown.  
The SGM42622B is available in a Green TQFN-3×3-16L 
package. It operates over an ambient temperature 
range of -40℃ to +85℃.

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.

FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM42622B is a low voltage stepper motor driver 
that 
includes 
a 
10-bit 
sequencer 
with 
1/256 
microstepping capability, two PWM current controllers 
and two protected full-bridges in power stage. 
 
Standby and Power-Up 
This device can be placed in standby mode to reduce 
the power consumption to near zero by pulling the 
STBY/RESET input pin below the VSTBYL threshold. 
In standby mode, the supply current of the controller is 
significantly reduced and the power stage is shutdown 
with outputs in a high-impedance state.  
Once the SGM42622B exits the standby mode, the 
controller restarts like a power-up situation. 
 
Microstepping Sequencer 
The 4-bit binary value on the MODEx inputs is latched 
just after power-up or when the device exits standby 
mode. In normal operation, the input value is ignored 
and the MODE3 and MODE4 inputs act as step clock 
(STCK) and direction (DIR) inputs. The only exception 
is when MODE1 and MODE2 are both at low state. In 
such condition, the latched value is ignored and the 
device operates in full-step mode. If either MODE1 or 
MODE2 input returns to high state, the previous 
operating mode will be restored.

Figure 4. Mode Selection Examples 
 
The sequencer is a 10-bit counter used to set the PWM 
current controller’s reference and H-bridge current 
direction. The counter resets to zero after power-up or 
standby and is counted with each rising edge of STCK. 
It is increased if DIR = high or decreased if DIR = low. 
The current direction and references that determine the 
output currents of the device as listed in Table 2 for 
full-step mode. VREF is the reference input (0.1V to 0.5V 
recommended) to adjust the output current magnitudes. 
The values for other step modes are listed in Table 2. 
Table 3 lists the reference and sequencer values for 1/2, 
1/4 and 1/8 step modes. For higher microstepping 
resolutions, the same pattern is extended. Positive 
numbers show that the output current flows from 
OUTx1 to OUTx2, and negative numbers show 
opposite direction. 
In all step modes, the home state (reset) is loaded in 
sequencer at power-up or after exiting the standby 
mode.

FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION (continued) 
PWM Current Control 
Figure 5 shows bridge current flow and PWM timing 
control. Each bridge has its own independent PWM 
current controller. The bridge current flows from its 
negative pole to ground through a sense pin and a 
sense resistor. The sense pin voltage (VSENSEA or 
VSENSEB) is proportional to the phase current and 
compared to the reference that is set based on the 
sequencer value and VREF (Table 2). As soon as VSENSEx 
exceeds the VREFx value, a comparator triggers the 
off-time and the decay sequence. 
In off-time, the current first decays with a slow rate and 
then with a fast rate. In the slow decay portion, both 
low-side switches of the full-bridge are turned on, and 
output voltage is near zero. When 5/8 of the tOFF_SLOW 
has expired, the polarity of the output voltage is 
reversed by current recirculating to start the fast decay.  
 
Reverse voltage is generated by circulating the current 
through the high-side switch. 
The reference voltage (VREF) must be chosen based on 
the load peak current and the sense resistance: 
VREF = RSENSEx × ILOAD, PEAK                (1) 
The RSENSEx must be small enough to avoid excessive 
power loss in the resistor and prevent large negative 
voltage peaks on the SENSEx pin caused by current 
recirculation. A few resistances can be paralleled to 
achieve the required power rating and resistance value. 
Note that if the selected RSENSEx is too small, the 
accuracy and performance of the device will be 
degraded due to the low measurement sensitivity and 
influence of the noise and comparator offsets.

FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION (continued) 
Setting PWM Off-Time 
The total off-time (slow decay + fast decay) of the PWM 
is programmed by an external resistor (ROFF) between 
the TOFF pin and ground, as shown in Figure 6. For 
stable regulation, a small series RC branch must be 
placed parallel to the ROFF (see Table 4). 
The relationship between the off-time and the external 
resistor value is shown in Off-Time vs. ROFF curve. The 
value typically ranges from 10μs to 120μs.

Over-Current Protection (OCP) 
If the current through any FET exceeds the preset 
over-current threshold, all FETs in the H-bridge will be 
disabled for a period of approximately 16ms, and the 
EN/nFAULT pin will be pulled low. After the period, the 
chip resumes operation and EN/nFAULT pin is released. 
Over-current conditions are sensed in both directions: 
that is, a short to ground, supply, or across the motor 
winding will all result in an over-current shutdown. 
Note that over-current protection does not use the 
current sensing circuitry used for PWM current control 
and is independent of the ISENSE resistor value or VREF 
voltage. 
 
Thermal Shutdown 
If the die temperature (TJ) exceeds the maximum safe 
temperature threshold, a thermal shutdown event 
occurs. With a thermal shutdown the EN/nFAULT pin is 
pulled low by the internal open-drain MOSFET that 
disables the power stage as shown in Figure 7. 
The EN/nFAULT is released when TJ returns back to 
the safe range (TJ < TTSD - THYS).
