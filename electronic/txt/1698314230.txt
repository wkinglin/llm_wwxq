OCTOBER2023–REV.A 
ENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM2821 is a high efficiency, high-performance, 
Class-D audio power amplifier with dual mode of 
Automatic Level Control (ALC). It operates from 2.5V to 
5.5V supply voltage. When powered with 5V supply 
voltage, it is capable of delivering a continuous average 
output of 2.4W into 4Ω load with 1% THD+N. 
As a Class-D audio amplifier, the SGM2821 features up 
to 88% efficiency and 72dB PSRR at 217Hz which 
make the device ideal for battery-powered high-quality 
audio applications.  
A key benefit of the SGM2821 over typical Class-D 
audio power amplifiers is that it generates much less 
EMI emissions, thus greatly simplifying the system 
design for portable applications. The device also 
includes the over-current and short-circuit protections 
with auto-recovery, which ensures the device can be 
operated safely and reliably without the need for 
system interaction.

Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications.

IMPORTANT APPLICATION NOTES 
1. When turning on the supply voltage or cancelling 
the shutdown mode, it must first enter ALC-1 mode 
as the default state. Be sure that the device stays in 
ALC-1 mode for a period longer than 10µs, and 
then lower the voltage level of the CTRL pin to 
enter other operating modes. 
2. As a Class-D power audio amplifier, the SGM2821 
requires adequate power supply decoupling to 
ensure its optimum performance such as output 
power, efficiency, and THD+N. Place a 10µF 
decoupling ceramic capacitor as close to the VDD 
pin as possible. 
3. It is recommended to employ a ground plane for 
SGM2821 on the system board. 
4. Use a simple ferrite bead filter for further EMI 
suppression. Choose a ferrite bead with a rated 
current which is no less than 2A or greater for 
applications with a load resistance less than 6Ω. 
Also, place the respective ferrite beard filters as 
close to the output pins, VOP and VON, as 
possible. 
5. For applications where the power supply is rated 
more than 4.6V or the load resistance less than 6Ω, 
it is strongly recommended to add a simple 
snubber circuit (as shown in Figure 8) between the 
two output pins, VOP and VON, to prevent the 
device from accelerated deterioration or abrupt 
destruction due to excessive inductive flybacks that 
are induced on fast output switching or by an 
over-current or short-circuit condition.

3W Low EMI Class-D Audio Power Amplifier 
SGM2821 
with Dual Mode of Automatic Level Control

APPLICATION INFORMATION 
The SGM2821 is a high efficiency, high-performance, 
filterless Class-D audio power amplifier with dual 
modes of Automatic Level Control (ALC). The SGM2821 
operates from 2.5V to 5.5V supply. When powered with 
5V supply voltage, the SGM2821 is capable of 
delivering up to 3W into a 4Ω load or 1.7W into an 8Ω 
load, with 10% THD+N in ALC-OFF mode. 
As a Class-D power audio amplifier, the SGM2821 
features 88% high efficiency and 72dB PSRR at 217Hz 
which make the device ideal for battery-supplied, 
high-quality audio applications. A key benefit of the 
SGM2821 over typical Class-D audio power amplifiers 
is that it generates much less EMI emissions, thus 
greatly simplifying the system design for portable 
applications. The device includes the circuitry can 
minimize turn-on and turn-off transients (also known as 
pops-and-clicks), as well as auto-recovering over- 
current protection (OCP) and short-circuit protection 
(SCP). 
Furthermore, the SGM2821 includes under-voltage 
lockout to ensure proper operation when the device is 
first powered up, and thermal-overload protection to 
safeguard the die temperature during operation. 
Fully Differential Amplifier 
The SGM2821 is configured in a fully differential 
topology. The fully differential topology ensures that the 
amplifier outputs a differential voltage on the output that 
is equal to the differential input times the gain. The 
common-mode feedback ensures that the common- 
mode voltage at the output is biased around 1.6V 
regardless of the common-mode voltage at the input. 
Although the fully differential topology of the SGM2821 
can still be used with a single-ended input, it is highly 
recommended that the SGM2821 be used with 
differential inputs in a noisy environment, like a wireless 
handset, to ensure maximum noise rejection. 
Automatic Level Control (ALC) 
The automatic level control is to maintain the audio 
output signals for a maximum voltage swing without 
distortion when an excessive input that may cause 
output clipping is applied. With the ALC function, the 
SGM2821 lowers the voltage gain of the amplifier to an 
appropriate value such that the clipping at the outputs 
is eliminated. It also eliminates the clipping of the 
output signal due to the reduction of the power-supply 
voltage. 
The attack time and release time of the ALC are 
separately set for ALC-1 and ALC-2 modes, as shown 
in Table 1. The attack time is defined as the time 
interval required for the gain fall to its steady-state gain, 
assumed that a sufficiently large input signal is applied. 
The release time is the time interval required for the 
amplifier to exit out of the present mode of operation.

Mode Control 
Shutdown and Startup 
When the CTRL pin is pulled to ground, the SGM2821 
is forced into the shutdown mode. In the shutdown 
mode, all the circuitry is disabled and the supply current 
is eliminated except leakage current, and the 
differential outputs are shorted to ground through an 
internal resistor (2.5kΩ) individually. Once in the 
shutdown mode, the CTRL pin must remain low for at 
least 1ms (the shutdown settling time), before it can be 
brought high again. When the CTRL pin is asserted 
high, the device exits out of the shutdown mode and 
enters into the ALC-1 mode after a startup time (tSTUP) 
of 29ms. 
CTRL Voltage Setting 
The mode of operation in SGM2821 is determined by 
the voltage applied to the CTRL pin. An example of 
setting the mode of operation by a host processor or 
microcontroller is shown in Figure 5. As depicted in the 
Figure 5, three external resistors (RCTRL1, RCTRL2 and 
RCTRL3 with ±1% accuracy) connected to the CTRL pin 
and two GPIO ports from the host are used to set the 
voltage at the CTRL pin. By asserting the two GPIO 
pins high or low, 4 modes of operation (ALC-1, ALC-2, 
ALC-OFF and Shutdown) are defined, as described in 
Table 2. It is recommended to add a ceramic capacitor 
(≥ 0.1μF) to the CTRL pin to smooth out the mode 
transition as well as to minimize noise interference.

In Table 2, ‘H’ indicates a high-level output voltage (VIO) 
at the host’s I/O ports. ‘L’ indicates a low-level output 
voltage (GND) at the ports. To generate a proper 
voltage at the CTRL pin for a specific mode of 
operation, the two GPIO ports are required to have 
sufficient pull-down capability. Also, the ground (GND) 
of the host must be at the same potential as that of 
SGM2821. Furthermore, the voltage at the CTRL pin is 
a function of the supply voltage (VIO) applied onto the 
host. Table 3 defines suitable resistors to be used for 
various supply voltages at VIO.

In applications where only ALC-1 and shutdown modes 
are needed, the CTRL circuit diagram can be simplified 
as shown in Figure 6. In this case, one external resistor 
(RCTRL1) and one GPIO port are used to set the voltage 
at the CTRL pin. The value of the resistor is chosen 
such that the resulting RC time constant (≥ 1ms) will 
provide sufficient noise rejection at the CTRL pin. Two 
modes of operation (ALC-1 and Shutdown) are defined, 
as described in Table 4. It is recommended to add a 
ceramic capacitor (≥ 0.1μF) to the CTRL pin to smooth 
out the mode transition as well as to minimize noise 
interference.

APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued) 
Mode Transition 
When SGM2821 exits shutdown mode to working state, 
it must first enter ALC-1 mode as the default state. Be 
sure that the device stays in ALC-1 mode for a period 
longer than 10µs. After the startup, the device can be 
configured into another active state, either ALC-2 or 
ALC-OFF, and can also transition back and forth 
among three active modes as dictated by the host 
without constraints. 
Filterless Design 
Traditional Class-D amplifiers require an output filter. 
The filter adds cost and the size of the system board. 
Furthermore, it degrades the performance of power 
efficiency and THD+N. The SGM2821’s filterless 
modulation scheme does not require an output filter. 
Because the switching frequency of the SGM2821 is 
well beyond the bandwidth of most speakers, voice coil 
movement due to the switching frequency is very small. 
Use a speaker with a series inductance larger than 
10µH. An 8Ω speaker typically exhibits a series 
inductance in the range from 20µH to 100µH. 
However, LC filter is required when the trace between 
the SGM2821 and the speaker exceeds 100mm. Long 
trace acts like tiny antenna and generates EMI 
emissions which may result in FCC and CE certification 
failures. 
Low EMI Design 
Traditional Class-D amplifiers require the use of 
external LC filters, or shielding, to minimize EMI 
emissions. The SGM2821 uses a proprietary edge-rate- 
controlled (ERC) circuitry to reduce EMI emissions, 
while maintaining high efficiency. 
How to Reduce EMI 
The SGM2821 does not require an LC output filter for 
short connections from the amplifier to the speaker. 
However, additional EMI suppressions can be made by 
use of a ferrite bead in conjunction with a capacitor, as 
shown in Figure 7. Choose a ferrite bead with low DC 
resistance (DCR) and high impedance (100Ω ~ 330Ω) 
at high frequencies (> 100MHz). The current flowing 
through the ferrite bead must be also taken into 
consideration. The effectiveness of ferrites can be 
greatly aggravated at much lower than the rated current 
values. Choose a ferrite bead with at least 2A rated 
current. The capacitor value varies based on the 
chosen ferrite bead and the actual speaker lead length. 
Choose a capacitor less than 1nF based on EMI 
performance.

RC Snubber Circuit 
For applications where the power supply is rated more 
than 4.6V or the load resistance less than 6Ω, it may 
become necessary to add an RC snubber circuit 
between the two output pins, VOP and VON, for 
robustness and reliability. Figure 8 shows a simple RC 
snubber circuit, which can be used to prevent the 
device from accelerated deterioration or abrupt 
destruction due to excessive inductive flybacks that are 
induced on fast output switching or by an over-current 
or short-circuit condition.

Under-Voltage Lockout (UVLO) 
The SGM2821 incorporates circuitry designed to detect 
a low supply voltage. When the supply voltage drops 
below 2V (TYP), the SGM2821 goes into shutdown 
mode. The device will emerge out of the shutdown 
mode and resume its normal operation only when the 
supply voltage is restored to above 2.2V (TYP) and the 
CTRL pin is pulled high.

APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued) 
Auto-Recovering Over-Current Protection 
(OCP) & Short-Circuit Protection (SCP) 
Once an over-current or a short-circuit condition at the 
differential outputs is detected, either to the power 
supply or to ground or to each other, the SGM2821 
goes into shutdown mode. During shutdown, the 
SGM2821 activates auto-recovering process whose 
aim is to return the device to normal operation once the 
fault condition is removed. This process repeatedly 
examines if the fault condition persists, and returns the 
device to normal operation immediately after the fault 
condition is removed. This feature helps protect the 
device from large currents and maintain long-term 
reliability while removing the need for external system 
interaction to resume normal operation. 
Over-Temperature Shutdown (OTSD) 
The thermal-overload protection on the SGM2821 
prevents the device from being damaged when the die 
temperature exceeds +160℃. Once the die temperature 
exceeds the prescribed value, the device will be forced 
into shutdown mode and the outputs are disabled. Note 
that this is not a latched fault. Instead, the thermal fault 
will be cleared once the temperature of the die is 
lowered by 30℃. This large hysteresis will prevent it 
from generating motor boating sound and allow the 
device resume normal operation without the need for 
external system interaction. 
Pop-and-Click Suppression 
When asserting CTRL pin from low to high level, the 
SGM2821 features a 29ms startup turn-on time to 
suppress the click-pop noise. For the best power-off 
pop performance, the amplifier should be placed in 
shutdown mode before removing the power supply 
voltage. 
Decoupling Capacitor (CS) 
The decoupling capacitor stabilizes the power supply 
voltage applied onto the SGM2821, thus improving its 
THD performance. It also prevents voltage ringing with 
a long lead. A ceramic capacitor of 10µF with low 
equivalent-series-resistance (ESR) is required for 
decoupling and to be placed as close to the SGM2821 
as possible to minimize the resistance and inductance 
of the traces between the device and the capacitor. To 
filter out lower-frequency noise, a capacitor of 100µF or 
greater should be placed close to the SGM2821. 
Input Capacitors (CI) 
The input capacitors and input resistors determine the 
corner frequency of the high-pass filter. The corner 
frequency (fC) is calculated with the Equation 1. 
=
π
C
I
I
1
f
2 RC
                  (1) 
where RI = 29kΩ. 
The corner frequency directly influences the low 
frequency signals and consequently determines output 
bass quality. 
PCB Layout 
As the output power increases, the interconnect 
resistance (PCB traces and wires) among the audio 
amplifier, load, and power supply creates a voltage 
drop. The voltage loss on the traces between the 
SGM2821 and the load results in lower output power 
and lower efficiency. The higher trace resistance 
between the supply and the SGM2821 has the same 
effect as a poorly regulated supply, increasing the 
voltage ripples on the supply line and also reducing the 
peak output power. The effect of the residual trace 
resistance will be intensified as the output current 
increases. To maintain the highest output voltage swing 
for a maximum output power, the PCB traces that 
connect the output pins to the load and the supply pins 
to the power supply should be as wide and short as 
possible to minimize trace resistance. 
The use of power and ground planes will give the best 
THD+N performance. While reducing trace resistance, 
the use of power planes also creates parasite 
capacitors that help filter the power supply line. 
The inductive nature of the speakers can also result in 
overshoots on one or both edges, clamped by the 
parasitic diodes to ground and VDD in each case. From 
an EMI standpoint, this is the highly unfavorable 
waveform that will radiate or conduct to other 
components 
on 
the system board and cause 
interference. It is essential to keep the power and 
output traces short and well shielded if possible. Use of 
ground 
planes, 
beads, 
and 
micro-strip 
layout 
techniques are all useful in preventing unwanted 
interference.

APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued) 
As the distance from the SGM2821 to the speaker 
increases, the amount of EMI radiation will increase 
since the output wires or traces acting as antenna 
become more efficient with their lengths. Acceptable 
EMI is highly application specific. Ferrite bears placed 
close to the SGM2821 may be needed to reduce EMI 
radiation. The value of the ferrite bears is also application 
specific.
