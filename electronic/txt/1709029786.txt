JULY2016–REV. A
GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
The SGM8712 is a dual, ultra-low power comparator, 
which consumes only 300nA (TYP) supply current per 
channel at 1.4V. The device can operate from 1.4V to 
5.5V single supply, and is guaranteed to operate at 1.4V, 
2.5V and 5V. It supports rail-to-rail input operation. The 
above features make the SGM8712 a good choice for 
battery-powered applications. 
The SGM8712 has a push-pull output structure. When 
driving any resistive or capacitive load, it is capable of 
consuming the absolute minimum power. 
The SGM8712 has a great trade-off between low power 
and high speed, and the propagation delay is only 6μs 
with 100mV overdrive at 1.4V. 
In addition, the SGM8712 fits in a small package, so it 
is also suitable for mobile phone and handheld electronic 
devices. 
The SGM8712 is available in a Green MSOP-8 package. 
It is rated over the -40°C to +85°C temperature range. 
FEATURES 
● Ultra-Low Supply Current: 
300nA/Channel (TYP) at VS = 1.4V 
● Supply Voltage Range: 1.4V to 5.5V 
● Push-Pull Output 
● Output Drive Capability: 19mA (TYP) at VS = 5V 
● Rail-to-Rail Input and Output 
● Propagation Delay: 6μs (TYP) at VS = 1.4V 
● -40℃ to +85℃ Operating Temperature Range 
● Available in a Green MSOP-8 Package

OVERSTRESS CAUTION 
Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to 
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods 
may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any 
conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended 
Operating Conditions section is not implied. 
 
ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION 
This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are 
not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all 
integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. 
Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures 
can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle 
performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision 
integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage 
because even small parametric changes could cause the 
device not to meet the published specifications. 
 
DISCLAIMER 
SG Micro Corp reserves the right to make any change in 
circuit design, or specifications without prior notice.
