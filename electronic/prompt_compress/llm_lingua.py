"SGM8091/SGM8092  SGM8093/SGM8094  350MHz, Rail-to-Rail Output,  CMOS Operational Amplifiers      SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  JANUARY2013\u2013REV.B.4  GENERAL DESCRIPTION  The SGM8091/3 (single), SGM8092 (dual) and  SGM8094 (quad) are low cost, high speed, voltage  feedback amplifiers. These devices can operate from  2.5V to 5.5V single supply, and consume 4.3mA low  quiescent current per amplifier. And, the supply current  of SGM8093 is only 75\u03bcA in power-down mode. So  SGM8093 is suitable for battery-powered equipment and  portable devices, which require low power dissipation.  The SGM8091/2/3/4 provide a wide input common  mode voltage range and rail-to-rail output voltage  swing.  These devices are designed to provide optimal  performance in all aspects. They exhibit a wide  bandwidth of 350MHz (G = +1) and a 0.1dB gain  flatness of 125MHz (G = +1). The short settling time and  low distortion make the operational amplifiers appropriate  for buffering high speed ADC and DAC.   The SGM8091 is available in Green SOT-23-5 and  SOIC-8 packages. The SGM8092 is available in Green  SOIC-8 and MSOP-8 packages. The SGM8093 is  available in Green SOT-23-6 and SOIC-8 packages.  The SGM8094 is available in Green SOIC-14 and  TSSOP-14 packages. They are specified over the  extended -40\u2103 to +125\u2103 temperature range.

Functional operation of the device at any  conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended  Operating Conditions section is not implied.    ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION  This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are  not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all  integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions.  Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures  can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle  performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision  integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage  because even small parametric changes could cause the  device not to meet the published specifications.

"content": "APPLICATION INFORMATION  Rail-to-Rail Output  The SGM8091/2/3/4 support rail-to-rail output operation.  In single power supply application, for example, when  +VS = 5V, -VS = GND, 1k\u03a9 load resistor is tied from  OUT pin to ground, the typical output swing range is  from 0.03V to 4.97V.    Driving Capacitive Loads  The SGM8091/2/3/4 are not designed for driving heavy  capacitive load. If greater capacitive load must be  driven in application, the circuit in Figure 1 can be used.  In this circuit, the IR drop voltage generated by RISO is  compensated by feedback loop.        Figure 1. Circuit to Drive Heavy Capacitive Load    Power Supply Decoupling and Layout  A clean and low noise power supply is very important in  amplifier circuit design. Besides of input signal noise,  the power supply is one of important source of noise to  the amplifiers through +VS and -VS pins. Power supply  bypassing is an effective method to clear up the noise  at power supply, and the low impedance path to ground  of decoupling capacitor will bypass the noise to GND.  In application, 10\u03bcF ceramic capacitor paralleled with  0.1\u03bcF or 0.01\u03bcF ceramic capacitor is used in Figure 2.  The ceramic capacitors should be placed as close as  possible to +VS and -VS power supply pins.

Amplifier Power Supply Bypassing    Grounding  In low speed application, one node grounding technique  is the simplest and most effective method to eliminate  the noise generated by grounding. In high speed  application, the general method to eliminate noise is to  use a complete ground plane technique, and the whole  ground plane will help distribute heat and reduce EMI  noise pickup.    Reduce Input-to-Output Coupling  To reduce the input-to-output coupling, the input traces  must be placed as far away from the power supply or  output traces as possible. The sensitive trace must not  be placed in parallel with the noisy trace in same layer.  They must be placed perpendicularly in different layers  to reduce the crosstalk. These PCB layout techniques  will help to reduce unwanted positive feedback and  noise.

A. 2    GENERAL DESCRIPTION  The SGM3752 is an asynchronous Boost WLED driver  with high efficiency, low EMI and high output voltage.  The Boost converter integrates a 40V, 1.5A internal  FET which operates at 1.2MHz switching frequency. Its  strong driving ability can drive single or multiple parallel  LED strings, which can be used as LED driver for smart  phone and tablet backlight.  The default LED current can be programmed by the  external current-sense resistor RSET. By varying the  duty cycle of the PWM signal applied to the CTRL pin,  the internal reference voltage is adjusted, which  ultimately adjusts the LED sink current. With full PWM  duty cycle, the internal reference voltage VREF is 200mV  (TYP). The SGM3752 is essentially a driver that adopts  analog dimming control, and it will not produce audible  noise on the output capacitor. The SGM3752 integrates  ringing cancellation, and it can effectively reduce EMI  noise in DCM mode. The SGM3752 provides excellent  line regulation and load regulation, as well as excellent  load transient response. The SGM3752 also features  various protection functions such as open LED  protection, OCP protection and thermal shutdown  protection.  The SGM3752 is available in a Green TSOT-23-6  package.

{"product_name": "SGM3752", "content": "DETAILED DESCRIPTION  The SGM3752 is an asynchronous Boost converter that  operates at 1.2MHz switching frequency and integrates  a power FET with peak current limit of 1.5A. The  maximum output voltage can reach 38V. The device is  capable of driving LEDs from 1 series to 10 series and  the input voltage range is 2.7V to 5.5V. The strong  driving capability of the device can drive single or  multiple parallel LED strings, which can be used as  LED driver for smart phone and tablet backlight.  The SGM3752 operates with peak current control, and  the internal compensation circuit greatly reduces the  complexity of the design. The loop design can be  completed with only one external sampling resistor  RSET. Peak current mode controls the on time of the  switching FET by comparing the error signal of the  internal GM amplifier with the inductance current signal.  Through the duty cycle of the PWM signal added to the  CTRL pin, the SGM3752 can set the reference voltage  VREF. When the duty cycle is 100%/10%/1%, the typical  values of VREF are 200mV/20.3mV/2.5mV respectively,  and the supported PWM signal has a wide frequency  range from 10kHz to 100kHz. It can realize linear  dimming in the range of PWM duty cycle 0.2% to 100%.  The SGM3752 also has excellent line regulation and  load regulation, as well as excellent load transient  response performance. It also has complete protection  functions, including open LED protection, OCP  protection and thermal shutdown protection. At the  same time, the output current can be programmed  through the resistor RSET connected to the FB pin.    Soft Start-Up  SGM3752 integrates the soft start-up function to ensure  that the output voltage of Boost converter rises slowly  by limiting the output voltage of GM amplifier during  start-up. This method effectively avoids the surge  current. After the start-up is completed, the device  switches  to  the  internal  reference  voltage  for  closed-loop control.    Open LED Protection  Open LED protection feature shuts off the IC in case of  LED or RSET disconnection, which prevents damage to  the device. The SGM3752 monitors the voltage of SW  pin in each switching cycle. When VSW exceeds VOVP  threshold for 8 consecutive cycles, the device turns the  switch FET off, and shuts down the IC. The device  remains in shutdown until the CTRL pin is toggled to  logic high. This function can effectively prevent the  device from being damaged when the output voltage  exceeds VOVP threshold.    Shutdown  When the CTRL pin remains low voltage for more than  2.5ms, the SGM3752 enters shutdown mode. In  shutdown mode, the internal switch FET stops  switching, and the device maintains in a low loss  condition. At the same time, the minimum forward  voltage of the LED array should be kept higher than the  maximum input voltage. Otherwise a DC current path is  resulted from the inductor and Schottky diode to the  LED array.    Current Program  The FB pin voltage VFB depends on the internal  reference voltage VREF. At full PWM duty cycle, the  typical value of VREF is 200mV. The external  programming of LED current can be realized by using  the current-sense resistor connected in series with the  LED. The RSET resistor value is given by Equation 1:  FB LED SET V I R =                 (1)  where  ILED = sum of LED string(s) current  VFB = FB pin regulation voltage  RSET = current sense resistor.  The FB voltage accuracy and current sense resistor  accuracy determines the output current accuracy.    LED Brightness Dimming  The PWM signal applied to the CTRL pin controls the  LED current. For PWM dimming signal, the device  required PWM frequency range is 10kHz to 100kHz,  which can obtain accurate reference voltage and small  LED current ripple. The LED brightness dimming can  be realized by changing PWM duty cycle. The  relationship between duty cycle and FB regulation  voltage is calculated by Equation 2:  VFB = Duty \u00d7 200mV + 0.75mV         (2)  where  Duty = duty cycle of the PWM signal  200mV = internal reference voltage  0.75mV = most appreciate maximum from production  statistics       38V High Efficiency, Boost White  SGM3752  LED Driver with PWM Dimming Control      9  AUGUST 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued)  The LED brightness is easily adjusted by controlling the  duty cycle of the PWM signal applied to CTRL pin. The  recommended minimum PWM duty cycle is 0.1% for no  blind dimming.  As shown in Figure 3, the SGM3752 adjusts the 200mV  reference voltage based on PWM duty cycle of the  CTRL pin. The PWM reference voltage is then filtered  by the internal RC filter. The RC filter output is then fed  to the non-inverting input of the error amplifier. The  advantage is that the value of the reference voltage  VREF only depends the duty cycle of the PWM signal  and does not depend on the amplitude. Under this  working principle, although the PWM signal is used for  dimming, its essence is an analog dimming. The PWM  signal is only used to modulate the reference voltage  VREF, which can avoid the occurrence of audible noise.    GM Amplifer VBG 200mV EA Output CTRL FB VREF     Figure 3. FB Voltage Adjustment via PWM Signal    However, it should be noted that since the reference  voltage VREF is obtained by the charge and discharge of  the RC low-pass filter, the VREF has a ripple voltage with  the same frequency as the PWM signal, which will  significantly increase the LED ripple current. With the  increase of PWM signal frequency, the ripple voltage of  VREF decreases, and the LED ripple current decreases.    Under-Voltage Lockout  Under-voltage lockout prevents the device from  operating at input voltage below 2.2V (TYP). When VIN  falls below 2.2V, the device enters shutdown mode and  the internal switch FET is turned off. If VIN reaches 2.3V  (TYP), the IC will resume operation.    Thermal Shutdown  When the junction temperature of the IC exceeds 160\u2103 (TYP), the internal thermal shutdown is triggered and  the device enters the shutdown state. When the  junction temperature is dropped by 20\u2103 (TYP), the  device will restart and resume operation.    Operation with CTRL  The CTRL pin is an enable control pin with logic high  voltage of 1.5V and logic low voltage of 0.4V. When the  control voltage of CTRL pin is higher than 1.5V and the  input voltage is higher than the UVLO threshold, the  device starts up. When the control voltage of CTRL pin  is lower than 0.4V, the device enters shutdown mode  and the switch FET is turned off.       38V High Efficiency, Boost White  SGM3752  LED Driver with PWM Dimming Control      10  AUGUST 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  ", "index": 4}
{"product_name": "SGM3752", "content": "APPLICATION INFORMATION  The SGM3752 is a 38V high-efficiency and low EMI  Boost DC/DC converter, which supports dimming by  changing the duty cycle of the PWM signal applied to  CTRL pin. The stable dimming range is 0.2% to 100%.  The device has excellent line regulation, load regulation  and transient response performance. It can be widely  used in various panel backlight lighting.    Design Requirements  In this design example, Table 1 lists the operating  conditions. The LED array adopts 10S1P, and the  output current of each string of LED is 20mA.  Table 1. Design Parameters  DESIGN PARAMETER  EXAMPLE VALUE  Input Voltage Range  2.7V to 5.5V  Output, LED Number per String  10  Output, LED String Number  1  Output, LED Current per String  20mA    Inductor Selection  Inductance is an important power device for Boost  converter  design.  Selecting  appropriate  inductor  parameters can ensure that the system has high  efficiency and stable steady-state performance. At the  same time, it will also affect the system transient  response and loop stability. Inductor\u2019s DC resistance,  saturation current and inductance are important specs  for DC/DC design. Large inductance results in small  ripple current, which is beneficial to smaller output  ripple voltage and higher transmission efficiency. Use  Equation 3 to calculate the average inductor current  IL(DC):  OUT OUT L(DC) IN V I I V \u03b7 \u00d7 = \u00d7              (3)  where  VOUT = Boost output voltage  IOUT = Boost output current  VIN = Boost input voltage  \u03b7 = power conversion efficiency.    Use the minimum input voltage, maximum output  voltage, and maximum load current to calculate the  worst-case average current. The selected inductor  should provide a peak to peak ripple current \u0394IL(P-P) to  be 30% to 40% of inductor average DC current IL (DC)  calculated in Equation 3.

When the inductor current  is close to or higher than the saturation current, the  inductance will drop rapidly, which causes the peak  inductor current to rise and reach the peak current limit  of the IC. The selected inductor\u2019s saturation current  should maintain a 20% margin, and a 4.7\u03bcH to 10\u03bcH  inductor is recommended for SGM3752.    Schottky Diode Selection  In order to ensure the best efficiency of SGM3752, the  selected Schottky diode should have low forward  voltage, fast reverse recovery speed, and low junction  capacitance. At the same time, the average and peak  current ratings of the selected diode should exceed the  average output current and peak inductor current. It is  recommended to have a 20% current margin.  Additionally, the Schottky diode reverse breakdown  voltage should be higher than the open LED protection  voltage threshold to avoid damage. It is recommended  to use ONSemi NSR0240 for the SGM3752.       38V High Efficiency, Boost White  SGM3752  LED Driver with PWM Dimming Control      11  AUGUST 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued)  Output Capacitor Selection  The output capacitance of SGM3752 is used to meet  the loop stability and output ripple requirement. At the  same time, it affects the loop bandwidth and the  transient response performance. MLCC capacitor with  low ESR is recommended as the output capacitor. For  a given output voltage ripple requirement, the minimum  output capacitance value can be calculated according  to Equation 6:    ( ) OUT IN OUT OUT OUT S RIPPLE V V I C V f V \u2212 \u00d7 = \u00d7 \u00d7          (6)  where  VRIPPLE = peak-to-peak output ripple.  A 1\u03bcF to 10\u03bcF MLCC capacitor is recommended for  typical application. Since the reference voltage VREF is  obtained by filtering the pulse signal, the actual output  ripple contains the pulsed ripple, which carries the  same frequency as the PWM signal. The interference  ripple can be effectively reduced by using 1\u03bcF MLCC  capacitor. For higher total output current applications, it  is recommended to use 2.2\u03bcF or larger MLCC output  capacitor to minimize output ripple.    LED Current Set Resistor  Use Equation 1 to calculate the RSET resistance.  Multiple resistors can also be connected in parallel to  obtain the required resistance value.    Thermal Considerations  Thermal dissipation of the IC should be considered to  design the SGM3752. High IC junction temperature will  trigger thermal shutdown. The heat loss is related to the  system input and output. Lower input voltage and  higher output current leads to more heat loss. The  thermal dissipation can be reduced by reasonable  layout. The allowable heat loss of device can be  determined by Equation 7:  A D JA 150 T P \u03b8 \u2212 = \u2103              (7)  where  TA = the ambient temperature for the application.  \u03b8JA = the thermal resistance junction-to-ambient given  under absolute maximum ratings section.    Power Supply Recommendations  The SGM3752 operates with an input voltage range of  2.7V to 5.5V. It is recommended to use 22\u03bcF MLCC  capacitor as the input capacitor. If the SGM3752 is  located far away from the input power supply, an  additional high-capacity capacitor is recommended to  damp the wiring inductance.    EMI Precaution and Ringing Cancelling  Careful layout, routing and selection of decoupling  components are critical to suppress EMI related noise.  Ways of EMI suppression include propagation limit and  reduction of energy swings, such as inserting ferrite  bead  in  power  supply  trace,  selecting  high  self-resonance frequency decoupling capacitors and  SW node ringing cancellation. Figure 4 is a simplified  circuit showing that ringing is caused by diode\u2019s  junction capacitance Cj and Boost inductor L, which  injects current swings into power supply traces; the 2  voltage waveforms on the right illustrate the difference  of circuit performance, with or without ringing  cancellation.

Good layout plays a positive  role in loop stability, signal integrity and low EMI. Since  the switch FET of SGM3752 works at a typical  switching frequency of 1.2MHz, its power circuit layout  needs to be designed more carefully. The SW node  contains high dV/dt and di/dt switching. The area of SW  node should be as small as possible, and the input and  output loop needs to maintain the minimum loop path,  which can effectively suppress the generation of ringing.  For the high current path, it should be as wide and short  as possible. The input capacitance CIN should be close  to VIN pin and GND pin to reduce the influence of  parasitic parameters on the line. The inductor and the  Schottky diode should be placed close to the SW pin to  reduce the area of the SW node, which reduces EMI.  The output capacitance COUT should be as close to  VOUT as possible, and the ground of COUT should be  close to GND pin to reduce grounding return. FB  resistors should be placed close to FB pin. For signal  grounding, it is recommended to route the ground  signal away from the power ground plane with small  and short traces, and connect the signal ground with  power ground via a single point close to the GND pin.

# > {'compressed_prompt': 'Question: Sam bought a dozen boxes, each with 30 highlighter pens inside, for $10 each box. He reanged five of boxes into packages of sixlters each and sold them $3 per. He sold the rest theters separately at the of three pens $2. How much did make in total, dollars?\nLets think step step\nSam bought 1 boxes x00 oflters.\nHe bought 12 * 300ters in total\nSam then took 5 boxes 6ters0ters.\nHe sold these boxes for 5 *5\nAfterelling these  boxes there were 3030 highlighters remaining.\nThese form 330 / 3 = 110 groups of three pens.\nHe sold each of these groups for $2 each, so made 110 * 2 = $220 from them.\nIn total, then, he earned $220 + $15 = $235.\nSince his original cost was $120, he earned $235 - $120 = $115 in profit.\nThe answer is 115',
