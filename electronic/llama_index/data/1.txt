There are two packaging sizes for SGM42600

SGM42600  Dual H-Bridge Motor Driver        SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  FEBRUARY 2019 \u2013 REV. A  GENERAL DESCRIPTION  The SGM42600 is a motor driver device with two  integrated H-bridges that can run one bipolar stepper  motor or two DC brush motors. It can be used in a  variety of applications such as printers and battery-  powered toys.  Each H-bridge consists of four N-MOSFETs to drive  one motor winding. The SGM42600 can supply up to  2A peak or 1.5A RMS output current (with proper  heatsinking at VCC = 5V and TA = +25\u2103). At lower VCC  voltages, the current capability is decreased slightly.  Internal  protection  functions  are  provided  for  over-current  protection  (OCP),  power  supply  under-voltage  lockout  (UVLO),  charge  pump  under-voltage lockout (CPUV) and over-temperature  protection (OTP). Fault conditions are indicated by the  nFAULT pin.  Sleep mode allows saving power when the device is  not driving the motor. The SGM42600 will enter into  sleep mode when nSLEEP is low.  The SGM42600 is available in Green TQFN-4\u00d74-16L  and TSSOP-16 (Exposed Pad) packages. It operates  over an ambient temperature range of -40\u2103 to +125\u2103.
