Feature Description  For SGM4040, the precision level of this Zener diode is  significant. For the regulation of SGM4040, the required  quiescent current for this device is low. Also, shunting  the load current to the ground is one method to regulate  and it depends on the load resistance and level of input  voltage. For operating SGM4040, an external resistor  between the cathode and power supply is required for  setting the input current. For getting lower noise, an  external capacitor is also recommended to filter the  noise at the input and output pins of the precision Zener  diode.    Device Functional Modes  The output of SGM4040 is fixed and non-adjustable,  which means there is a feedback loop inside the device  and the Zener diode operates in the closed-loop mode.  Also, the device will work typically if IZ is between the  range of IZMIN and IZMAX, so a proper selection of  external resistor is important to make sure that the load  and cathode current are within the typical range.

{"product_name": "SGM4040", "content": "APPLICATION INFORMATION  The SGM4040 is designed to provide a voltage  reference accurately with ultra-low power dissipation.  For the application of critical-space system, the  sub-miniature packages (SOT-23 and SC70-5) can be  selected. Because of the excellent stability of the shunt  voltage reference, the capacitors are not required to be  connected between CATHODE and ANODE pins.  However, if a bypass capacitor is required, the stability  of SGM4040 will not be reduced. For SGM4040, the  typical cathode current is 48uA to 15mA, and the  reversed breakdown voltage is 2.5V.  Between ANODE pin and CATHODE pin is a parasitic  Schottky diode. Therefore, leaving * pin (pin 3 of  SOT-23 package or pin 2 of SC70-5 package) floating  or connected to ANODE pin is a good choice.     Load Current and Cathode  For the shunt regulator shown in Figure 2, RS is  required to be connected between VS and the cathode  of SGM4040. The value of RS is significant for this  shunt regulator because it determines how much  current can be flowed to the voltage reference itself (IZ)  and the load (IL), and the user needs to make sure that  the cathode current (IZ) is operated within the design  specification. However, for one extreme case, if the  supply voltage and load is varied (the load current IL is  maximum and the VS is minimum), it is recommended  that the resistance of RS should be selected low  enough to guarantee normal operation of the shunt  regulator. For the other extreme, IL is minimum and VS  is maximum, the resistance of RS should be large  enough to guarantee that the operating current IZ is less  than 15mA.  The equation 1 shows the calculation of RS.  \u2212 = + S Z S L Z V V R I I                  (1)    SGM4040 IZ + IL VS RS IL VZ IZ     Figure 2. Shunt Regulator    Thermal Hysteresis  The definition of thermal hysteresis is the voltage  change at +25\u2103 after thermal cycling to -40\u2103 and  +125\u2103 respectively. To explain, first finish thermal  cycling at -40\u2103, then measure the output voltage after  moving the device into the condition of +25\u2103. Second,  finish thermal cycling at +125\u2103 and then measure the  output voltage at +25\u2103. The difference of the output  voltage at these two testing conditions is the thermal  hysteresis. The thermal hysteresis is common for the  precision device because of the stress of thermal-  mechanical package. Also, thermal hysteresis will be  contributed by temperature of mounting, operating and  storing.
