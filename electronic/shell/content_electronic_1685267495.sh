The output will switch as  the result of the input noise, although there is 6mV  internal hysteresis. For this case, it is recommended to  add external resistors at the positive terminal of the  comparator. For the circuit which is shown in Figure 3,  the external 25mV hysteresis is added so the total  hysteresis is 31mV, which will improve the noise  immunity. The equation shown as below is used to  calculate the total supported hysteresis of the circuit.

Adding Hysteresis to the SGM8752-1Q    Relaxation Oscillator  A relaxation oscillator can be made by SGM8752-1Q  due to its high speed property. For the following circuit,  the R2 network with the same resistance sets two trip  points which are 1/3VS and 2/3VS. The resistance of R2  network should be small enough to reject the effect of  parasitic capacitance as the operation of SGM8752-1Q is  high speed. The 1/3VS and 2/3VS are the two thresholds  of the input signal, which can switch the output of the  signal. Also, after calculation, the sum of charging and  discharging period is 2ln2 × R1C. With the application  which is shown as below, the calculated oscillated  frequency is equal to 10.9MHz. However, because of  the parasitic capacitance, the theoretical frequency is  around 9.6MHz.  Design Requirements  For the R2 network, the users must set values of three  resistors equally to ensure that the two trip points are  equal to 1/3VS and 2/3VS. Also, the resistance of R2  network should be small enough to reject the effect of  parasitic capacitance. In addition, there are two  requirements for the value of R1, which are drawing  less current and providing high switching frequency. On  top of this, higher capacitance for the capacitor is  required for improving the error which is caused by the  tolerance and parasitic capacitance.    Detailed Design Procedure  For the application, the positive input, +VIN is equal to  the 1/3VS if the VOL is close to GND. And +VIN is equal  to 2/3VS if the VOH is close to VS.  The charging and discharging periods at the negative  input and which are reflected at VC, are the same, and  the value of charging and discharging period is equal to  R1C.    2/3VS 1/3VS +VS 1.38R1C t VC + _ R2 = 5kΩ R1 = 1kΩ R2 = 5kΩ R2 = 5kΩ C = 62pF VS = 5V +VS SGM8752-1Q VOUT t f = 10MHz     Figure 4.

Because  SGM8752-1Q is a high speed comparator, it is excellent to use the device for the designing of a high speed window  comparator, with two thresholds VHI and VLO. If the voltage level of VIN is between the two thresholds of the circuit,  the output of the circuit will be in high position. For the application of active low which is shown in Figure 6, the  position of VHI and VLO is different from the application in Figure 5. On top of this, the supported voltage ranges for  both of the applications are from 2.7V to 5.5V.    + _ + _ VHI VIN VLO VOUT SGM8752-1Q SGM8752-1Q V VHI VLO VIN VOUT Time     Figure 5.

For the noisy or high impedance power  supply condition, a bypass capacitor should be added  closed to the power supply pin to enhance the stability.  The section of Layout illustrates how to place the  bypass capacitor.    Layout  An excellent design for PCB layout is necessary for  high speed devices. Any stray capacitance or improper  grounding will influence the performance of the high  speed comparator.  In order to minimize the propagation delay, the users  should make sure that the resistance of the signal  source is as low as possible. The resistance from the  input signal and the stray capacitance can create an  RC filter, which can decrease the amplitude for  high-frequency component. In addition, the input  capacitance and the stray capacitance result in several  pF capacitances.  The paralleled 2.2μF and 0.1μF ceramic capacitors  need to be placed as close to the device. The 2.2μF  capacitor is used to enhance the stability by rejecting  the ripple, and 0.1μF capacitor provides a charge for  high-frequency component.  For high speed applications, the rising or falling edge of  the signal will cause a potential DC voltage shift. For  minimizing this negative influence, a plane of GND  should be taken into account as it can reduce the effect  of stray capacitance. Also, the ground plane can  provide multiple paths for the current flow. In addition,  for the high speed signal, the current will flow back at  GND plane under its previous signal path. Any hole and  via can increase the inductance which can reduce the  performance of the high speed transmission. If vias are  necessary at the ground plane, please place them  randomly.               6.5ns, Rail-to-Rail I/O,   SGM8752-1Q  High Speed, Automotive Comparator      13  MAY 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  "}'
