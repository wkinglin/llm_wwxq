BOOT pin is used to provide a drive voltage higher than the input voltage to the  high-side power switch. Place a 0.1μF Boost capacitor (CBOOT) as close as possible to the IC between  this pin and SW pin.  2  GND  G  Ground Pin. It is the reference for input and the regulated output voltages. Special layout  considerations are required.  3  FB  I  Feedback Input. Feedback pin for programming the output voltage. Connect a feedback resistor  divider tap to this pin.   4  EN  I  Precision Enable Input. The device is enabled if the voltage on this pin exceeds the 1.23V rising  threshold. It can be used to program the UVLO with a resistor divider on the VIN pin. Do not leave  this pin floating.  5  VIN  P  Power Supply Input Pin. This pin is connected to the input supply voltage and powers the internal  control circuitry. VIN voltage is monitored by a UVLO lockout comparator. Due to power  switching, this pin has high di/dt transition edges and must be decoupled to the GND by input  capacitors as close as possible to the GND pin to minimize the parasitic inductances.  6  SW  P  Switching Node Output. Switching node of the internal power converter and should be connected  to the output inductor and bootstrap capacitor. This node should be kept small on the PCB to  minimize capacitive coupling, noise coupling and radiation.

It can deliver up to 600mA to the output  over a wide input voltage range from 4V to 36V.   The SGM61307 employs peak-current mode control  with fixed-frequency in continuous conduction mode.  SGM61307A features a power-save mode in which  operating frequency is adaptively reduced under light  load conditions to reduce switching and gate drive  losses to keep high efficiency. SGM61307B operates in  PWM mode over the full load range to maintain  constant switching frequency and achieve low output  voltage ripple.  The EN pin can achieve the precision enable, and can  also be used to increase the input UVLO threshold by  using a resistor divider.  An internal precision reference voltage and a fixed  soft-start timer are included. Several protection  features such as input under-voltage lockout, output  over-voltage protection, hiccup mode short-circuit  protection, current limit protection, and thermal  shutdown are integrated to ensure safe operation.    Peak Current Mode Control  Figure 2 shows the functional block diagram and Figure  3 shows the switching node operating waveforms of the  SGM61307. Switching node voltage is generated by  controlling the duty cycles of the complementary  high-side and low-side switches. The duty cycle of the  high-side switch is used as control parameter of the  Buck converter to regulate output voltage and is  defined as: D = tON/tSW, where tON is the high-side  switch on-time and tSW is the switching period. During  high-side switch on-time, the SW pin voltage swings up  to approximate VIN, and the inductor current, IL, linearly  rises with a slope of (VIN - VOUT)/L. When control logic  turns off the high-side switch, the low-side switch will be  turned on after a short dead time. During off-time,  inductor current discharges through the low-side switch  with a slope of (-VOUT/L). In ideal case, where losses  are ignored, D is proportional to the output voltage and  inversely proportional to the input voltage: D = VOUT/VIN.

SW Node and Inductor Current Waveforms in  Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM)  The SGM61307 employs fixed-frequency peak-current  mode control in continuous conduction mode. In light  load conditions, the SGM61307A will enter power-save  mode to reduce the switching frequency and the  associated switching and gate drive losses.  In continuous conduction mode, the controller has an  outer voltage feedback loop to get accurate DC voltage  regulation. The output of the outer loop is fed to an  inner peak-current control loop as reference command  that adjusts the peak-current of the inductor. The  inductor peak-current is sensed from the high-side  switch and is compared to the peak-current reference  to control the duty cycle. In other words, as soon as the  inductor current reaches the reference peak-current  determined by voltage loop, the high-side switch is  turned off and the low-side switch is turned on after  dead time. The voltage feedback loop is internally  compensated,  which  allows  for  fewer  external  components, simpler design, and stable operation with  almost any combination of output capacitors.    Minimum Input Voltage (4V) and UVLO  The recommended minimum operating input voltage is  4V. It may operate with lower voltages that are above  the VIN rising UVLO threshold (3.75V TYP). If VIN falls  below its falling UVLO threshold (3.4V TYP), the device  will stop switching. The applications of UVLO include  ensuring  reliable  operation,  sequencing,  and  protections such as battery discharge.       4V to 36V Input, 600mA  SGM61307  Synchronous Buck Converter      14  DECEMBER 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) Enable  The voltage on the EN pin provides the precision  enable and disable of SGM61307. The device will  enable if the EN pin voltage exceeds the enable  threshold of 1.23V and VIN exceeds its UVLO threshold.  The device will disable if the EN voltage is externally  pulled low or the VIN pin voltage falls below its UVLO  threshold. The EN pin cannot be left floating and can be  connected to VIN to enable the operation of the device.  An  external  input  UVLO  adjustment  circuit  is  recommended in Figure 4. The EN input can be driven  by an external logic signal to facilitate system  sequencing and protection. If VEN < 1.1V (TYP), the  device will shut down. Only if VEN > 1.23V (TYP), the  device will start operation. It’s crucial to note that the  voltage supplied to the EN pin should never exceed VIN  + 0.3V.   VIN EN RENT RENB SGM61307   Figure 4. System UVLO by Enable Divider    Bootstrap Voltage  An internal regulator provides the bias voltage for gate  driver using a 0.1μF ceramic capacitor. X5R or better  dielectric types are recommended. The capacitor must  have a 10V or higher voltage rating.  The SGM61307 operates at maximum duty cycle when  input voltage is closed to output voltage as long as the  bootstrap voltage (VBOOT - VSW) is greater than its UVLO  threshold. When the bootstrap voltage falls below its  UVLO, the high-side switch is turned off, and the  integrated low-side switch is turned on to recharge the  BOOT capacitor. After the recharge, the high-side  switch is turned on again to regulate the output.    Soft-Start  The 1.8ms (TYP) soft-start time is integrated to slow  the ramp of output voltage when SGM61307 is first  enabled or powered up, which can prevent the input  inrush current.   At the beginning of power-up, there is a 35ms (TYP)  blank time tOCP_BLK during which the over-current  protection is disabled.   Without this feature, the inductor current will be large  enough to trigger the current-limit protection when  starting up with a large amount of output capacitors,  which may results in the hiccup mode and the output  voltage cannot ramp up to the regulation voltage.   By disabling the over-current protection during tOCP_BLK,  the output voltage of SGM61307 can be charged with  the maximum limited current and maximizes the output  current capacity.  The inductor current will not be out of control during  tOCP_BLK because the peak current limit (IHS_LIMIT) and  valley current limit (ILS_LIMIT) protection function are still  available.    Light-Load Operation (PSM Version)  At light loads, SGM61307A enters pulse-skipping  power-save mode (PSM) to reduce switching loss and  keep high efficiency by lowering the number of  switching pulses. When the peak inductor current is  below PSM current threshold, the corresponding  internal COMP voltage (VCOMP) will be lower than the  internal threshold, the device will enter PSM.   After entering PSM for a delay time, some modules are  shut down to minimum input current, and the device  draws only 77μA (TYP) input quiescent current. The  high-side MOSFET will not switch until the output  voltage falls for the internal VCOMP to rise above the  internal threshold. Since the integrated current  comparator catches the inductor peak-current only, the  average load current entering PSM varies with the  applications and external output filters.    Light-Load Operation (FPWM Version)  At light loads, SGM61307B still operates in PWM mode.  The frequency is constant, output voltage ripple is low  and the output voltage regulation is tight.    Minimum On-Time, Minimum Off-Time and  Frequency Foldback  Minimum on-time tON_MIN and minimum off-time tOFF_MIN,  are the smallest duration of time that the HS switch can  be on and off. tON_MIN is typically 85ns and tOFF_MIN is  typically 100ns in the SGM61307.       4V to 36V Input, 600mA  SGM61307  Synchronous Buck Converter      15  DECEMBER 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) In continuous conduction mode operation, the voltage  conversion range is limited by tON_MIN and tOFF_MIN  without frequency foldback.  With fixed switching frequency, the minimum duty cycle  allowed is  DMIN = tON_MIN × fSW             (1)  The maximum duty cycle allowed is  DMAX = 1 - tOFF_MIN × fSW           (2)  When the output voltage is given, the maximum VIN can  be found by  × OUT IN_MAX SW ON_MIN V V  = f t             (3)  The minimum VIN can be found by  × OUT IN_MIN SW OFF_MIN V V  = 1 - f t            (4)  In order to extend the maximum duty cycle and lower  the  minimum  duty  cycle,  SGM61307  features  frequency foldback when the tON_MIN or tOFF_MIN is  triggered.  When VIN voltage increases and the on-time decreases  to tON_MIN, the switching frequency starts to decrease to  lower the minimum duty cycle further for keeping VOUT  in regulation.  When VIN voltage decreases and the off-time  decreases to tOFF_MIN, the switching frequency starts to  decrease to extend the maximum duty cycle further for  keeping VOUT in regulation.  By frequency foldback, the frequency can be  decreased to about 165kHz minimum. For a given  output voltage, VIN_MAX is increased and VIN_MIN is  lowered. With the wide range of frequency foldback, the  output voltage can remain in regulation with a much  lower supply voltage, which leads to a lower drop-out.    Over-Current and Short-Circuit Protection  The SGM61307 features current limiting on both the  peak and valley inductor current under over-current  conditions. Hiccup mode is activated if overload or  short-circuit condition persists to prevent over-heating.  High-side MOSFET over-current protection is naturally  provided by peak current mode control. In each cycle,  the high-side current sensing starts after the high-side  switch has been turned on for a short time (blanking  time). The sensed high-side switch current is compared  with the Error Amplifier (EA) output (VCOMP) minus slope  compensation. By clamping VCOMP to a maximum value,  the peak current can be limited precisely.  The low-side switch current is also sensed and  monitored. If the current in the high-side switch  exceeds IHS_LIMIT, the high-side switch will automatically  be turned off and after a short dead-time, the low-side  switch will be turned on to take over the current in the  inductor. The low-side switch will be turned off if the  low-side switch current falls below ILS_LIMIT.  Under overload or short-circuit conditions, if the FB  voltage decreases to 30% of the reference voltage and  the current of the HS switch triggers IHS_LIMIT for 128  consecutive cycles, the output starts to hiccup and  device stops switching for about 135ms. After the  135ms off-period, the device is restarted with a  soft-start cycle. If the overload or short-circuit condition  is still present, the same hiccup cycle will repeat until  the fault is removed. Under over-current conditions,  hiccup mode reduces power dissipation and prevents  the over-heating to the device.  For SGM61307B, if the inductor current goes negative  and exceeds the negative current limit ILS_NEG, the  device stops switching. The negative current limit is  designed to protect the low-side switch from excessive  negative current.    Output Over-Voltage Protection (OVP)  The SGM61307 contains an over-voltage comparator  that monitors the FB pin voltage. The over-voltage  threshold is approximately 110% of nominal FB voltage.  When the voltage at the FB pin exceeds the  over-voltage threshold (VOUT_OV), switching will be  stopped and both high-side and low-side switches will  be turned off. If the over-voltage fault is removed, the  regulator will automatically recover.    Thermal Shutdown  To avoid damage from over-heating, the junction  temperature is continuously monitored. And if the  temperature exceeds the shutdown level (TSD = +170℃,  TYP), all power switches are turned off immediately.  When the device is cooled off for 20 ℃ (typical  hysteresis), the device automatically resumes normal  operation after a soft-start.       4V to 36V Input, 600mA  SGM61307  Synchronous Buck Converter      16  DECEMBER 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  "}'

The following design procedure can be used to select  components for the SGM61307.    Typical Application  Few external components are required for SGM61307  to convert from a wide voltage range supply to a lower  voltage level output. A basic schematic for the device  as a Buck converter is shown in Figure 5.  When select the external components, the needs of the  application and the stability criteria of the device's  control loop should be taken into consideration. Table 1  can be used to select external components.  Table 1.

To keep operating quiescent current small and prevent  voltage errors due to leakage currents, it  is  recommended to choose RFBB in the range of 10kΩ to  100kΩ. Given VOUT = 5V and choose the value of RFBB  to be 22.1kΩ, RFBT can be calculated from Equation 5.  The calculation result of RFBT is 116.025kΩ, a standard  value of 115kΩ is selected.         4V to 36V Input, 600mA  SGM61307  Synchronous Buck Converter      17  DECEMBER 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued)  Switching Frequency  Several parameters such as losses, inductor and  capacitors sizes and response time are considered in  selection of the switching frequency. Higher frequency  increases the switching and gate drive losses, and  lower frequency requires larger inductance and  capacitances, which results in larger overall physical  size and higher cost. Therefore, a tradeoff is needed  between losses and component size. As described in  Minimum On-Time, Minimum Off-Time and Frequency  Foldback section, the switching frequency is also  limited by the tON_MIN, tOFF_MIN, the input voltage, the  output voltage and the frequency foldback minimum  limitation. For this design, a switching frequency of  2MHz is selected.    Input Capacitor Selection  High-quality ceramic capacitor(s) (X5R or X7R or better  dielectric grade) must be used for input decoupling of  the SGM61307. At least 2.2μF of capacitance is  recommended on the VIN input. The voltage rating  should have adequate design margin to handle the  highest expected input surge voltage. The VIN  capacitor ripple current rating must also be greater than  the maximum input current ripple.  For this design, a ceramic capacitor with at least 50V  voltage rating is required to support the maximum input  voltage. So, one 4.7μF/50V, X7R capacitor is selected  for the input decoupling capacitor. To improve high  frequency filtering, a small parallel 0.1µF ceramic  capacitor is recommended to place as close as  possible to VIN and GND pins.    Inductor Selection  Three parameters of the inductor are critical in the  design: nominal inductance value, saturation current  and maximum RMS current.  Equation 6 is conventionally used to calculate the  output inductance of a Buck converter. The ratio of  inductor current ripple (∆IL) to the maximum output  current (IOUT) is represented as KIND factor (∆IL/IOUT).  The inductor ripple current is bypassed and filtered by  the output capacitor and the inductor DC current is  passed to the output. Inductor ripple is selected based  on a few considerations. The peak inductor current  (IOUT + ∆IL/2) must have a safe margin from the  saturation current of the inductor in the worst-case  conditions, especially if a hard-saturation core type  inductor (such as ferrite) is chosen. For peak current  mode converter, the saturation current should be  greater than the switch current limit.   Typically, a 20% to 40% ripple is selected (KIND = 0.2 to  0.4). Choosing a higher KIND value reduces the selected  inductance, however, a too high KIND factor may result  in insufficient slope compensation.   - = × × × IN_MAX OUT OUT MIN OUT IND IN_MAX SW V V V L I K V f        (6)  ( ) OUT IN_MAX OUT L IN_MAX SW V    V  - V ΔI  =  V    L   f × × ×            (7)  Generally, a smaller inductor is preferred to allow larger  bandwidth and smaller size. But inductor of too low  results in larger current ripple, which increases the  power dissipation in the inductor and MOSFETs. Larger  inductor current ripple also requires more output  capacitance to smooth out the larger current ripple. The  current limit can be falsely triggered with full load when  the inductor current ripple is large. For peak current  mode control, larger current ripple improves the signal  to noise ratio of comparator, and too small inductor  current ripple is not recommended.  In this example, KIND = 0.4 is chosen, and the minimum  inductor value for 36V input voltage is calculated to be  8.97μH. So the nearest larger inductance of 10μH with  2.4A RMS current and 3.2A saturation current is  selected.    Output Capacitor Selection  Three primary criteria must be considered for design of  the output capacitor (COUT):  1. The converter pole location.  2. The output voltage ripple.  3. The transient response to a large change in load  current.       4V to 36V Input, 600mA  SGM61307  Synchronous Buck Converter      18  DECEMBER 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued)  Equation 8 can be used to calculate the minimum  output capacitance that is needed to supply a current  step for 8 cycles until the control loop responds to the  load change with a maximum allowed output transient  of ΔVOUT_SHOOT (overshoot or undershoot).

The output voltage ripple caused by the output  capacitor charging and discharging can be dominated  by Equation 9:   ( ) ( ) IND OUT L OUT_C SW OUT SW OUT K I ΔI ΔV  =   =  8 f C 8 f C × × × × ×    (9)  Note that the impact of output capacitor ESR on the  transient is not taken into account in Equation 9. For  ceramic capacitors, the ESR is generally small enough  to ignore its impact on the calculation of ΔVOUT transient.  However, for aluminum electrolytic and tantalum  capacitors, or high current power supplies, the ESR  contribution to ΔVOUT must be considered. For a  specific output capacitance value, use Equation 10 to  calculate the output voltage ripple caused by the ESR  of the output capacitor.  OUT_ESR L IND OUT ΔV  = ΔI ESR = K I ESR × × ×      (10)  In this example, the target output ripple is 25mV. Given  ΔVOUT_ESR = ΔVOUT_C = 25mV, and chose KIND = 0.4.  The ESR of output capacitor should be smaller than  104mΩ according to Equation 10. And the COUT should  be larger than 0.6μF according to Equation 9.  Base on the above mentioned, the output capacitor  must be larger than 4.8μF. So, one 10μF, 16V, X5R  ceramic capacitor is selected after taking derating into  consideration.    Bootstrap Capacitor  The SGM61307 requires a small external bootstrap  capacitor, CBOOT, between the BOOT and SW pins to  provide the gate drive supply voltage for the high-side  MOSFET. The bootstrap capacitor is refreshed when  the high-side MOSFET is off and the low-side switch is  conducted. An X7R or X5R 0.1μF ceramic capacitor  with a voltage rating of 10V or higher is recommended  for stable operating performance over-temperature and  voltage variations.    Under-Voltage Lockout Set-Point  The Input UVLO can be programmed using an external  voltage divider on the EN pin of the SGM61307. In this  design, RENT is connected between VIN pin and EN pin  and RENB is connected between EN pin and GND (see  Figure 5). The UVLO has two thresholds, VIN_RISING for  power-up (turn-on) when the input voltage is rising and  VIN_FALLING for power-down (turn-off) when the voltage is  falling. The enable rising threshold voltage VEN_H is  1.23V (TYP) and enable hysteresis voltage VEN_HYS is  0.13V (TYP). Given VIN_RISING as 6.0V, select RENB to be  200kΩ to minimize input current from the supply, then  RENT and VIN_FALLING can be calculated by following  equations.  × ENT ENB IN_RISING EN_H ENB R  + R V  = V R          (11)    ×       IN_RISING ENT ENB EN_H V R  =   - 1 R V           (12)  ( )× ENT ENB IN_FALLING EN_H EN_HYS ENB R + R V  = V  - V R    (13)  By Equation 12, RENT is calculated to be 775.6kΩ, and  a standard value of 768kΩ is selected. Based on the  value of RENT, VIN_FALLING can be calculated to be 5.3V  by Equation 13         4V to 36V Input, 600mA  SGM61307  Synchronous Buck Converter      19  DECEMBER 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued)  Layout  Layout Guidelines  PCB is an essential element of any switching power  supply. The converter operation can be significantly  disturbed due to the existence of the large and fast  rising/falling voltages that can couple through stray  capacitances to other signal paths, and also due to the  large and fast changing currents that can interact  through parasitic magnetic couplings, unless those  interferences are minimized and properly managed in  the layout design. Insufficient conductance in copper  traces for the high current paths results in high resistive  losses in the power paths and voltage errors. Following  the guidelines provided here are necessary to design a  good layout:    Place low-ESR ceramic capacitor (X5R or X7R or  better dielectric) CIN as close as possible to VIN  pin and GND pin. The grounding for CIN and COUT  should be local on the top side planes that connect  to the GND pin.    Minimize the area and path length of the loop  formed by VIN pin, bypass capacitors connections,  SW pin and GND pin.    Use short, thick traces or copper pours for high  current conduction path like VIN, VOUT and GND.    Keep the SW area minimal and away from  sensitive signals like FB input and divider resistors  to avoid capacitive noise coupling.    Place the resistor divider of RFBT and RFBB as close  as possible to the FB pin and avoid long traces in  the divider network. Sense VOUT at the load and  place the sense path on the other side of a  shielded layer.    Use heat-sinking vias to connect the ground  planes on the top and bottom layers or multiple  copper layers for heat dissipation. Ensure that  there is enough copper for heat dissipation to keep  the junction temperature below +125℃.    Figure 6. Top Layer    Figure 7. Bottom Layer           "}'
