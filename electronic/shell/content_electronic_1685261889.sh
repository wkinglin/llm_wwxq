The two-wire control interface  of SGM457 is compatible with I2C bus. The operating  temperature range of the SGM457 is from -40℃ to  +125℃.  The temperature diode sensor is integrated into the  SGM457 device, and the thermal paths are provided by  the package leads and the plastic package. Due to the  low thermal resistance of metals, the package leads  provide the main thermal path.    Writing and Reading Operation  In order to access the specified pointer register of  SGM457, it is necessary to send the values of the  desired pointer register after addressing the slave  device. As already illustrates in Figure 3, the values of  pointer register are required after each write command.  If the master device desires to read the information of  the specified register, a write command must be sent by  the master at first to indicate which pointer register is  needed. First, the slave address should be sent with  the low state of R/W ഥ, followed by the address of the  pointer address. Second, the STARhould be sent by the  master (the slave address of the specified SGM457),  and then followed with the high state of R/W ഥ to indicate  a read command (Figure 4). For the condition of  repeated reading, it is not required for sending the  bytes of pointer register again, unless the device is  reset or the address of pointer register is altered by the  write command. It is unnecessary to repeatedly send  the Pointer Register values to the slave when the same  register continuously reads. Because the Pointer  Register will remain the previous value if there is no  write command to Pointer Register.    Slave Mode Operations  The SGM457 can also transmit or receive the data  under read or write condition. The device cannot drive  the SCL signal when used as a slave device.    Slave Receiver Mode  When the slave is desired to receive the data, the  master will firstly send a slave address to the slave,  followed by the R/W ഥ bit low. After transmitting the  slave address, the slave (SGM457) will pull SDA low to  indicate an acknowledgement. Then, the address of  pointer register is sent by the master and an  acknowledgement signal is also required for the slave  device. In addition, the data is written to the addressing  pointer register, and followed by the acknowledgement  signal from the slave device. If the master wants to stop  the transmission, a START or STOP command is  required.    Slave Transmitter Mode  The R/W ഥ is pulled high after the slave address is  transmitted by the master device, followed by an  acknowledgement of the slave. Then, the data is  transmitted by the specified pointer register of the slave  device, followed by the acknowledgement of the master.  In addition, if the master wants to stop the transmission,  it can generate a not-acknowledge command or  generate a START or STOP command to terminate the  transmission.    General Call  The SGM457 also supports a general call address  (0000000) when the eighth bit is low. After receiving an  acknowledgement signal from the slave device, the  master prepares to send a second byte to the device. In  this case, if the second byte is 00000110, the slave  device (SGM457) will go into power-up mode and reset  all registers. However, the SGM457 cannot acquire an  address for general call from the master device.    High-Speed (HS) Mode  If the transmission frequency is greater than 400kHz, in  order to make the SGM457 work in high-speed mode,  the byte that is 00001xxx must be transmitted after the  START condition by the master. However, the SGM457  does not need to generate an acknowledge byte, but  the input and output filters can be adjusted accordingly  (up to 2.85MHz) to make SGM457 operate in  high-speed mode. After the high-speed byte is  transmitted, the master will transmit a START  command, followed by the slave address to the  SGM457. In addition, the high-speed mode will stop  once the STOP command is transmitted from the  master, and the input and output filters of SGM457 will  be switched to the default mode.       Low Power, Low Supply Voltage,  SGM457  SOT Package, Digital Temperature Sensor      10  MAY 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued)  Timeout Function  If the SCL line is pulled low by 30ms, it means that the  SGM457 will perform reset mode. Under this condition,  the bus is released by SGM457 and then another  START function is required for operation. To prevent  the device goes into the timeout function, the operation  frequency of the SCL should be greater than or equal to  1kHz.    Programming  Conversion Rate (CR)  The value of CR1 and CR0 that are located in the  corresponding register to adjust the SGM457 device  conversion rates of 0.25Hz, 1Hz, 4Hz, or 8Hz. The  default rate is 4Hz. For more details on the conversion  rate bits, refer to Table 2.    Table 2. Conversion Rate Settings  CR1  CR0  Conversion Rate  0  0  0.25Hz  0  1  1Hz  1  0  4Hz (default)  1  1  8Hz  The startup conversion is taken placed immediately as  the power-up or general-call reset. For the first result of  the conversion, it should be after 13ms. For the active  mode, the quiescent current for the conversion is  200µA (typical at +25℃, VCC = 3.3V). For the delay  mode, the quiescent current in this period is just 3.2µA  (typical at +25℃, VCC = 3.3V).  Delay Time Startup Start of Conversion 13ms 13ms   Figure 6. Conversion Start    Shutdown Mode (SD)  Low power shutdown mode is activated when the SD  bit is 1 in the configuration register. This mode saves  power obviously by shutting down most of the circuitry  of SGM457. When SD is set to 0, the SGM457 will  enter a continuous mode.    One-Shot/Conversion Ready (OS)  The SGM457 device can be configured to one-shot  mode, which is used to minimize the power  consumption when continuous temperature detection is  unnecessary. When the SGM457 is in shutdown mode,  users can configure the OS bit to 1 to start a one-shot  temperature measurement. The OS bit remains 0 until  the  conversion  is  completed.  After  the  single  measurement, the OS bit will read 1 and the device will  enter to shutdown mode. The OS bit is also a flag to  indicate whether this conversion is completed.  The single conversion time is 13ms in normal operation  and the time for a single temperature reading will not  exceed 20µs, which means that a higher conversion  rate can be obtained because there is no additional  delay. The conversion rate can reach 60Hz or more in  this mode.    Continuous-Conversion Mode  The continues-conversion mode is that the sigma-delta  ADC of the SGM457 device converts the analog data to  digital data and with a constant conversion rate. If the  default value of SD bit in configuration register is 0 , the  SGM457 will enter a continuous mode. Users can set  the value of CR1 and CR0 that are located in the  corresponding register to achieve different conversion  rates. Typically, the conversion rate for SGM457 is 4Hz.  If the users desire to set a different conversion rate, the  single conversion will be achieved first, and then the  device will be powered down to wait the appropriate  CR1 and CR0.  Extended Mode (EM)  The extended-mode bit can be set to obtain different  work mode in SGM457. The default mode is normal  mode (EM = 0), in which the data of the temperature  register and high-limit and low-limit registers are 12-bit  data format. Users can replace the SGM457 with the  SGM452 in normal mode.  The Extended mode (EM = 1) is used for applications  with temperatures exceeding +128℃. In this mode, the  data format for related temperature register is 13 bits.

For detail description, refer to the  High-Limit and Low-Limit Registers section.  Comparator Mode (TM = 0):  For the comparator mode (TM = 0), the ALERT pin is  pulled to active if the measured temperature equals to  or higher than THIGH value. The ALERT pin is changed  to inactive status when temperature is lower than TLOW  value.  Interrupt Mode (TM = 1):  For the interrupt mode (TM = 1), the ALERT pin will  change to an active state if the measured temperature  is higher than THIGH, or lower than TLow , and the active  status will be cleared when any register is read.

For the slaves connected to the bus, at the  CLK rising edge, the slaves start to be addressed by  the master, and followed by a READ or WRITE bit. For  the ninth bit of the transmission signal, if SDA is pulled  low, the slave acknowledges the transmission, in which  case the slave is being addressed.  In one word, for the data transfer process, the initial  signal will indicate a start state, and then followed by  eight clock pulsed and an acknowledge signal.  However, the stability of SDA signal should be  guaranteed when SCL is high, otherwise it will be  mistaken for START or STOP mode.

Serial Interface  On the two-wire bus, the SGM457 can work as a slave  device, which is controlled by the master. When  connecting to the bus, both SDA and SCL pins are  connected through the topology of open-drain. In  addition, in order to improve the performance of slave  devices under the condition of input peak value and  noise bus, filter and Schmitt flip-flop are adopted. There  are two modes of transmission protocol: fast mode  (1kHz to 400kHz) and high-speed mode (1kHz to  2.85MHz). MSB is the first bit to be transferred when  transmitting a byte.    Serial Bus Address  For the definition of I2C communication, before sending  data, the master device should address the specified  slave device. There are seven bits for the address of  the slave device and another one bit is for the  command of reading or writing.  The SGM457 has four different slave addresses as  shown in Table 3. For the function of the address, it can  use to indicate the location or designator of  temperature  for  four  different  connected  slave  SGM457s.  Table 3.

The SGM457 contains four data registers and  an extra pointer register. The point register can be set  to different value (shown in Table 7) to select internal  register for communication. Table 6 indicates the bits of  the pointer register byte. The power-up default value of  P0, P1 is 00, which means that SGM457 can also read  the temperature register after the device power-up.    Figure 7. Internal Register Structure    Temperature Register  The digital output of each temperature measurement is  stored in the read-only temperature register. The  temperature register of the SGM457 device can be set  to two modes, 12-bit resolution mode (configuration  register EM bit = 0, refer to the Extended Mode (EM)  section) or 13-bit resolution mode (configuration  register EM bit = 1). The digital output data consists of  two bytes as shown in Table 8 and Table 9. Byte 1 is  the most significant byte, followed by byte 2, the least  significant byte. The first 12 bits (13 bits in EM) are read  to acquire temperature data. The LSB data can be  ignored in those applications with low temperature  accuracy. The temperature data format is indicated in  Table 4.  Table 4. 12-Bit Temperature Data Format  Temperature (℃)  Digital Output (Binary)  Hex  +128  011111111111  7FF  +127.9375  011111111111  7FF  +100  011001000000  640  +80  010100000000  500  +75  010010110000  4B0  +50  001100100000  320  +25  000110010000  190  +0.25  000000000100  004  0  000000000000  000  -0.25  111111111100  FFC  -25  111001110000  E70  -55  110010010000  C90  One LSB equals to 0.0625℃. Negative numbers are  expressed by binary complement format. The power-up  or reset default value of temperature register is 0x00  until the first conversion is completed. In normal mode  (EM bit = 0), the first 12 bits are used to store  temperature data, the last 4 bits are 0. In extended  mode (EM bit = 1), the first 13 bits are used to store  temperature data, the last 3 bits are 0, and this is the  difference between the two modes.  For converting the positive temperature to the  corresponding digital data:  1. The result of the temperature should be divided by  the LSB of the temperature.  2. Convert the decimal value to binary value.  For example: (50℃)/(0.0625℃/LSB) = 800 = 320h =  001100100000  For converting the digital value to the corresponding  temperature:  1. Convert the 12-bit digital signal to the corresponding  decimal value, and MSB = 0 means that the  corresponding temperature is a positive value.  2. The result of decimal value should be multiplied by  the LSB to get the corresponding temperature.  For example: 001100100000 = 320h = 800 × (0.0625℃ /LSB) = 50℃        SCL Pointer Resister Temperature  Resister Configuration  Resister TLOW Resister THIGH Resister I/O Control  Interface SDA  Low Power, Low Supply Voltage,  SGM457  SOT Package, Digital Temperature Sensor      13  MAY 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  REGISTER DESCRIPTION (continued)  For converting the negative temperature to the  corresponding digital data:  1. The result of the absolute temperature should be  divided by the LSB of the temperature.  2. The value of two’s complement format can be  obtained by obtaining the complementary of the result  digital value and adding 1. Note that a negative number  with MSB = 1.  For example: (|-25℃|)/(0.0625℃/LSB) = 400 = 190h =  000110010000  Two's complement format: 111001101111 + 1 =  111001110000.  For converting the negative digital value to the  corresponding temperature:  1. Convert data to complement format (by reversing the  digital value then adding 1)  2.Convert the complement format binary data to  decimal number and multiply by the LSB (0.0625℃),  then the decimal number should be multiplied by -1.  For example: 111001110000 has two’s compliment of  000110010000 = 000110001111 + 1  Convert to temperature: 000110010000 = 190h = 400;  400 × (0.0625℃/LSB) = 25℃ = (|-25℃|); (|-25℃|) × (-1)  = -25℃  Table 5. 13-Bit Temperature Data Format  Temperature (℃)  Digital Output (Binary)  Hex  +150  0100101100000  0960  +128  0100000000000  0800  +127.9375  0011111111111  07FF  +100  0011001000000  0640  +80  0010100000000  0500  +75  0010010110000  04B0  +50  0001100100000  0320  +25  0000110010000  0190  +0.25  0000000000100  0004  0  0000000000000  0000  -0.25  1111111111100  1FFC  -25  1111001110000  1E70  -55  1110010010000  1C90    Configuration Register  The configuration register is composed of two bytes as  indicated in Table 10 and Table 11. The bits D[3:0] of  byte 2 remain 0. The bits D[7:4] and the byte 1 are  functional bits to control the working mode of the  SGM457 device. Due to the the same format for  Configuration Register, the SGM457 are compatible  with the SGM452. All registers are updated based on  MSB first and then LSB.    Converter Resolution (R1/R0)  The read-only bits, R1 and R0, are used to indicate the  converter resolution. After power-up or reset of the  device, R1 = 1, R0 = 1, represents that the resolution is  12 bits.    One-Shot (OS)  Refer to the One-Shot/Conversion Ready (OS) section  for more details.    EM Bit  Refer to the Extended Mode (EM) section for more  details.    Alert (AL Bit)  The AL bit is read only. The comparator mode status  can be obtained by accessing the AL bit. The POL bit  can control the data polarity of the AL bit. When the  POL bit value is 0, the AL bit value is changed from 1 to  0 once the temperature equals to or is higher than THIGH  for the serial number of programmed faults. The AL bit  keeps 0 until the temperature is lower than TLOW for the  serial number of programmed faults, when its value is 1  again. The status of the TM bit has no influence on the  status of the AL bit.  Measured  Temperature ALERT (Comparator Mode) POL = 0 ALERT (Interrupt Mode) POL = 0 ALERT (Comparator Mode) POL = 1 ALERT (Interrupt Mode) POL = 1 THIGH TLOW Read Read Read   Figure 8.

After measuring  the temperature, the device will compare the result  value with two thresholds to check if it exceeds the  limitation. The result will affect configuration register  TM bit to operate ALERT pin as a comparator output or  interrupt.  For the compared mode (TM = 0), the ALERT pin is set  to active if the measured temperature equals to or  higher than THIGH. And it also produces a serial number  of faults based on status of F1 and F0 fault bits. The  ALERT pin is changed to inactive status when  temperature is lower than TLOW value for the same  number of faults.  For the interrupt mode (TM = 1), the ALERT pin is set to  active (as presented in Table 2) if the measured  temperature equals to or higher than THIGH or a serial  number of faults are produced. The ALERT pin is  changed to inactive status when register is read. The  ALERT pin is reset for the shutdown mode. After the  ALERT pin is reset, pin status is active again only when  temperature is lower than TLOW value, but pin status is  changed to inactive once register is read. When the  ALERT pin is reset, the above cycle repeats, with the  ALERT pin is set to active if the measured temperature  equals to or higher than THIGH. General call reset  command also can reset the ALERT pin and clear all  the internal registers, changing the device mode to  comparator mode (TM = 0).  Table 12 to Table 15 indicate the format for the THIGH  and TLOW registers. Significantly, the most significant  byte is sent first, then the least significant byte is sent  later. THIGH = +80℃ and TLOW = +75℃ are two default  values for power-up. THIGH ,TLOW and Temperature  share the same format in register.    Register Maps  Table 6.

By utilizing the programmable  address options, it is possible to monitor up to four  different locations on the board using a single serial  bus.  VCC SCL SGM457 Two-Wire Host  Controller ADD0 ALERT SDA GND RPULL-UP 5kΩ  0.01μF VCC 1.6V to 5.5V   Figure 9. Typical Connections    Design Requirements  The pull-up resistors of recommended value of 5kΩ on  the SCL, SDA, and ALERT pins of SGM457 are  necessary. In some devices, the values of pull-up  resistor can be closed to 5kΩ but the current of any  pins should not be higher than 3mA. A 0.01µF bypass  capacitor shown in Figure 9 is also required to reduce  the interface from power supply noise. Using pull-up  resistors can help SCL and SDA lines pull up to VCC or  higher power supply. Connection between ADD0 pin to  any of the GND, VCC, SDA, or SCL pin can set  required address on the bus.    Detailed Design Procedure  When measuring the heat source, the SGM457 must  be placed as close to the measured source as possible,  and a good layout is also required for the coupling of  heat. Furthermore, this kind of placement can make  sure that changes in the measured temperature can be  detected as quickly as possible. In addition, the  accuracy of the measurement for surface or air  environment will be enhanced by isolating the SGM457  from the ambient temperature.  Due to the low power consumption characteristics of  SGM457, the noise level generated by the SGM457 is  low. To further reduce the noise issue from SGM457  and ensure that it does not affect other devices  connected to the same power supply, an RC filter can  be taken into account, and the value of resistor RF in  Figure 10 should be lower than 5kΩ and the value of  capacitor CF should be greater than 10nF.  VCC SCL SGM457 ADD0 ALERT SDA GND CF ≥10nF Supply Voltage RF ≤ 5kΩ   Figure 10. Noise Reduction Techniques    Power Supply Recommendations  The SGM457 has a power supply voltage range of 1.6V  to 5.5V. Power supply between 1.8V and 3.3V is  optimized for temperature accuracy in the whole range  of supply.    Layout Guidelines  Suggest using 0.01μF bypass capacitor and putting it  at nearest place of supply and ground pins. And for the  noisy power supply case, another capacitor should be  added to reject the noise of the power supply. Two 5kΩ  resistors are also required for SDA and SCL pins for  their open-drain topology.      "}'
