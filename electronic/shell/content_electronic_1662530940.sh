The  maximum output voltage can reach 38V. The device is  capable of driving LEDs from 1 series to 10 series and  the input voltage range is 2.7V to 5.5V. The strong  driving capability of the device can drive single or  multiple parallel LED strings, which can be used as  LED driver for smart phone and tablet backlight.  The SGM3756 operates with peak current control, and  the internal compensation circuit greatly reduces the  complexity of the design. The loop design can be  completed with only one external sampling resistor  RSET. Peak current mode controls the on time of the  switching FET by comparing the error signal of the  internal GM amplifier with the inductance current signal.  Through the duty cycle of the PWM signal added to the  CTRL pin, the SGM3756 can set the reference voltage  VREF. When the duty cycle is 100%/10%/1%, the typical  values of VREF are 200mV/20.3mV/2.5mV respectively,  and the supported PWM signal has a wide frequency  range from 10kHz to 100kHz. It can realize linear  dimming in the range of PWM duty cycle 0.2% to 100%.  The SGM3756 also has excellent line regulation and  load regulation, as well as excellent load transient  response performance. It also has complete protection  functions, including open LED protection, OCP  protection and thermal shutdown protection. At the  same time, the output current can be programmed  through the resistor RSET connected to the FB pin.    Soft Start-Up  SGM3756 integrates the soft start-up function to ensure  that the output voltage of Boost converter rises slowly  by limiting the output voltage of GM amplifier during  start-up. This method effectively avoids the surge  current. After the start-up is completed, the device  switches  to  the  internal  reference  voltage  for  closed-loop control.    Open LED Protection  Open LED protection feature shuts off the IC in case of  LED or RSET disconnection, which prevents damage to  the device. The SGM3756 monitors the voltage of SW  pin in each switching cycle. When VSW exceeds VOVP  threshold for 8 consecutive cycles, the device turns the  switch FET off, and shuts down the IC. The device  remains in shutdown until the CTRL pin is toggled to  logic high. This function can effectively prevent the  device from being damaged when the output voltage  exceeds VOVP threshold.    Shutdown  When the CTRL pin remains low voltage for more than  2.5ms, the SGM3756 enters shutdown mode. In  shutdown mode, the internal switch FET stops  switching, and the device maintains in a low loss  condition. At the same time, the minimum forward  voltage of the LED array should be kept higher than the  maximum input voltage. Otherwise a DC current path is  resulted from the inductor and Schottky diode to the  LED array.    Current Program  The FB pin voltage VFB depends on the internal  reference voltage VREF. At full PWM duty cycle, the  typical value of VREF is 200mV. The external  programming of LED current can be realized by using  the current-sense resistor connected in series with the  LED. The RSET resistor value is given by Equation 1:  FB LED SET V I R =                 (1)  where  ILED = sum of LED string(s) current  VFB = FB pin regulation voltage  RSET = current sense resistor.  The FB voltage accuracy and current sense resistor  accuracy determines the output current accuracy.    LED Brightness Dimming  The PWM signal applied to the CTRL pin controls the  LED current. For PWM dimming signal, the device  required PWM frequency range is 10kHz to 100kHz,  which can obtain accurate reference voltage and small  LED current ripple. The LED brightness dimming can  be realized by changing PWM duty cycle. The  relationship between duty cycle and FB regulation  voltage is calculated by Equation 2:  VFB = Duty × 200mV + 0.75mV         (2)  where  Duty = duty cycle of the PWM signal  200mV = internal reference voltage  0.75mV = most appreciate maximum from production  statistics       38V High Efficiency, Boost White  SGM3756  LED Driver with PWM Dimming Control      9  SEPTEMBER 2022  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued)  The LED brightness is easily adjusted by controlling the  duty cycle of the PWM signal applied to CTRL pin. The  recommended minimum PWM duty cycle is 0.1% for no  blind dimming.  As shown in Figure 3, the SGM3756 adjusts the 200mV  reference voltage based on PWM duty cycle of the  CTRL pin. The PWM reference voltage is then filtered  by the internal RC filter. The RC filter output is then fed  to the non-inverting input of the error amplifier. The  advantage is that the value of the reference voltage  VREF only depends the duty cycle of the PWM signal  and does not depend on the amplitude. Under this  working principle, although the PWM signal is used for  dimming, its essence is an analog dimming. The PWM  signal is only used to modulate the reference voltage  VREF, which can avoid the occurrence of audible noise.    GM Amplifer VBG 200mV EA Output CTRL FB VREF     Figure 3. FB Voltage Adjustment via PWM Signal    However, it should be noted that since the reference  voltage VREF is obtained by the charge and discharge of  the RC low-pass filter, the VREF has a ripple voltage with  the same frequency as the PWM signal, which will  significantly increase the LED ripple current. With the  increase of PWM signal frequency, the ripple voltage of  VREF decreases, and the LED ripple current decreases.    Under-Voltage Lockout  Under-voltage lockout prevents the device from  operating at input voltage below 2.2V (TYP). When VIN  falls below 2.2V, the device enters shutdown mode and  the internal switch FET is turned off. If VIN reaches 2.3V  (TYP), the IC will resume operation.    Thermal Shutdown  When the junction temperature of the IC exceeds 160℃ (TYP), the internal thermal shutdown is triggered and  the device enters the shutdown state. When the  junction temperature is dropped by 20℃ (TYP), the  device will restart and resume operation.    Operation with CTRL  The CTRL pin is an enable control pin with logic high  voltage of 1.5V and logic low voltage of 0.4V. When the  control voltage of CTRL pin is higher than 1.5V and the  input voltage is higher than the UVLO threshold, the  device starts up. When the control voltage of CTRL pin  is lower than 0.4V, the device enters shutdown mode  and the switch FET is turned off.         38V High Efficiency, Boost White  SGM3756  LED Driver with PWM Dimming Control      10  SEPTEMBER 2022  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  "}'

It can be widely  used in various panel backlight lighting.    Design Requirements  In this design example, Table 1 lists the operating  conditions. The LED array adopts 10S1P, and the  output current of each string of LED is 20mA.  Table 1.

Selecting  appropriate  inductor  parameters can ensure that the system has high  efficiency and stable steady-state performance. At the  same time, it will also affect the system transient  response and loop stability. Inductor’s DC resistance,  saturation current and inductance are important specs  for DC/DC design. Large inductance results in small  ripple current, which is beneficial to smaller output  ripple voltage and higher transmission efficiency. Use  Equation 3 to calculate the average inductor current  IL(DC):  OUT OUT L(DC) IN V I I V η × = ×              (3)  where  VOUT = Boost output voltage  IOUT = Boost output current  VIN = Boost input voltage  η = power conversion efficiency.    Use the minimum input voltage, maximum output  voltage, and maximum load current to calculate the  worst-case average current. The selected inductor  should provide a peak to peak ripple current ΔIL(P-P) to  be 30% to 40% of inductor average DC current IL (DC)  calculated in Equation 3.

When the inductor current  is close to or higher than the saturation current, the  inductance will drop rapidly, which causes the peak  inductor current to rise and reach the peak current limit  of the IC. The selected inductor’s saturation current  should maintain a 20% margin, and a 4.7μH to 10μH  inductor is recommended for SGM3756.    Schottky Diode Selection  In order to ensure the best efficiency of SGM3756, the  selected Schottky diode should have low forward  voltage, fast reverse recovery speed, and low junction  capacitance. At the same time, the average and peak  current ratings of the selected diode should exceed the  average output current and peak inductor current. It is  recommended to have a 20% current margin.  Additionally, the Schottky diode reverse breakdown  voltage should be higher than the open LED protection  voltage threshold to avoid damage. It is recommended  to use ONSemi NSR0240 for the SGM3756.       38V High Efficiency, Boost White  SGM3756  LED Driver with PWM Dimming Control      11  SEPTEMBER 2022  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued)  Output Capacitor Selection  The output capacitance of SGM3756 is used to meet  the loop stability and output ripple requirement. At the  same time, it affects the loop bandwidth and the  transient response performance. MLCC capacitor with  low ESR is recommended as the output capacitor. For  a given output voltage ripple requirement, the minimum  output capacitance value can be calculated according  to Equation 6:    ( ) OUT IN OUT OUT OUT S RIPPLE V V I C V f V − × = × ×          (6)  where  VRIPPLE = peak-to-peak output ripple.  A 1μF to 10μF MLCC capacitor is recommended for  typical application. Since the reference voltage VREF is  obtained by filtering the pulse signal, the actual output  ripple contains the pulsed ripple, which carries the  same frequency as the PWM signal. The interference  ripple can be effectively reduced by using 1μF MLCC  capacitor. For higher total output current applications, it  is recommended to use 2.2μF or larger MLCC output  capacitor to minimize output ripple.    LED Current Set Resistor  Use Equation 1 to calculate the RSET resistance.  Multiple resistors can also be connected in parallel to  obtain the required resistance value.    Thermal Considerations  Thermal dissipation of the IC should be considered to  design the SGM3756. High IC junction temperature will  trigger thermal shutdown. The heat loss is related to the  system input and output. Lower input voltage and  higher output current leads to more heat loss. The  thermal dissipation can be reduced by reasonable  layout. The allowable heat loss of device can be  determined by Equation 7:  A D JA 150 T P θ − = ℃               (7)  where  TA = the ambient temperature for the application.  θJA = the thermal resistance junction-to-ambient given  under absolute maximum ratings section.    Power Supply Recommendations  The SGM3756 operates with an input voltage range of  2.7V to 5.5V. It is recommended to use 22μF MLCC  capacitor as the input capacitor. If the SGM3756 is  located far away from the input power supply, an  additional high-capacity capacitor is recommended to  damp the wiring inductance.    EMI Precaution and Ringing Cancelling  Careful layout, routing and selection of decoupling  components are critical to suppress EMI related noise.  Ways of EMI suppression include propagation limit and  reduction of energy swings, such as inserting ferrite  bead  in  power  supply  trace,  selecting  high  self-resonance frequency decoupling capacitors and  SW node ringing cancellation. Figure 4 is a simplified  circuit showing that ringing is caused by diode’s  junction capacitance Cj and Boost inductor L, which  injects current swings into power supply traces; the 2  voltage waveforms on the right illustrate the difference  of circuit performance, with or without ringing  cancellation.

Good layout plays a positive  role in loop stability, signal integrity and low EMI. Since  the switch FET of SGM3756 works at a typical  switching frequency of 1.2MHz, its power circuit layout  needs to be designed more carefully. The SW node  contains high dV/dt and di/dt switching. The area of SW  node should be as small as possible, and the input and  output loop needs to maintain the minimum loop path,  which can effectively suppress the generation of ringing.  For the high current path, it should be as wide and short  as possible. The input capacitance CIN should be close  to VIN pin and GND pin to reduce the influence of  parasitic parameters on the line. The inductor and the  Schottky diode should be placed close to the SW pin to  reduce the area of the SW node, which reduces EMI.  The output capacitance COUT should be as close to  VOUT as possible, and the ground of COUT should be  close to GND pin to reduce grounding return. FB  resistors should be placed close to FB pin. For signal  grounding, it is recommended to route the ground  signal away from the power ground plane with small  and short traces, and connect the signal ground with  power ground via a single point close to the GND pin.
