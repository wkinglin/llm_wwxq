curl -XPOST 'http://localhost:9200/electronic_products/_create/7279' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"product_name": "SGM2066", "table_name": "APPLICATION INFORMATION", "content": "APPLICATION INFORMATION  The SGM2066 is a negative output charge pump which  has an inside adjustable regulator. The input voltage  range is from 2.7V to 5.5V and the unregulated output  equals to -VIN. The regulated output voltage range is  from -1.5V to -5V. The inrush current of the SGM2066  can be decreased by the internal soft-start circuit.    Negative Charge Pump  The technology of getting -VIN (unregulated output) is  by using the switched capacitors. Use an integrated  oscillator to create a switching signal for driving the  charge pump. The switching frequency of the oscillator  is from 60kHz to 2MHz (TYP). Also, the switching  frequency can be changed with the dropout voltage  between VIN and VCPOUT. When heavy load occurs, this  frequency will increase to compensate the output  ripple.  The SGM2066 will assume that there is an over-current  condition if |VCPOUT| < VIN/2, so that the resistance of  charge/discharge switches are increased by a factor of  10.    Negative Linear Regulator  The negative linear regulator VOUT is integrated with the  charge pump which powers it. For the properties of the  internal regulator, the dropout voltage, quiescent  supply and the output noise are extremely low. Also,  the range is from -1.5V to -5V.  VOUT is controlled by the feedback loop of the linear  regulator and the relationship between R1, R2 and VOUT  is VOUT = -1.225 × (R1 + R2)/R2.  The output ripple of the negative linear regulator is  extremely low because of the special design of Power  Supply Rejection Ratio for its charge pump.    Adjustable Regulator  The output voltage of the SGM2066 can be adjusted  from -1.5V to -5V. The VFB pin will be connected to two  external resistors as shown in Figure 3. The output  voltage is determined by the following equation:    = ×    1 FB OUT 2 R V V 1+R                (1)  where:  VOUT is output voltage and VFB is the internal voltage  reference, VFB = -1.225V. The value for R2 must be no  less than 50kΩ.  SGM2066 VIN EN C1+ C1- VOUT VFB CPOUT GND R1 CIN 4.7μF CFLY 1μF CPOUT 4.7μF R2 COUT 2.2μF VIN = 2.7V to 5.5V VOUT ON OFF VCPOUT     Figure 3. Adjustable Output Voltage Application    Enable Operation  The SGM2066 uses the EN pin to enable/disable the  device and to deactivate/activate the output automatic  discharge function.  When the EN pin voltage is lower than 0.4V, the device  is in shutdown state. There is no current flowing from  VIN to VOUT pins. In this state, the automatic discharge  transistor is active to discharge the output voltage  through RDIS1 (typically 130Ω) and RDIS2 (typically 125Ω).  When the EN pin voltage is higher than 1.1V, the device  is in active state. The output voltage is regulated to the  expect value and the automatic discharge transistor is  turned off.    Equivalent Output Resistance  The charge pump frequency and fly capacitor  determine the output resistance of the SGM2066 as  shown in the following equation:  = + × × O  ON FLY 1 R      8   R f   C          (2)  where:  RON is the on-resistance of each charge pump  MOSFET.  The output current (IO) and resistance (RO) determine  the charge pump output VCPOUT as shown in the  following equation:  VCPOUT = - (VIN - IO × RO)            (3)    Soft-Start  Soft-start circuitry is integrated into the IC, which  supplies the controlled slew rate for the output voltage  of the linear regulator to prevent the SGM2066 from  overshoot at the instant of start-up. The typical ramp-up  time is within 500μs (TYP). For the typically value of  slew-rate, it can reach 10V/ms (TYP).       Low-Noise Regulated,  SGM2066  Switched-Capacitor Voltage Inverter      11  APRIL 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued)  Load Capability  The summation of IOUT1 and IOUT2 should be less than  300mA (TYP) because of the limitation of the load  capability. Also, the changes of load capability are  associated with output and fly capacitors. If the  selected capacitors are smaller, the load capability will  be decreased.    Input Capacitor Selection (CIN)  The input decoupling capacitor is necessary to be  connected as close as possible to the VIN pin. A 2μF to  10μF dielectric X7R or X5R ceramic capacitor is  selected to get good dynamic performance.    Output Capacitor Selection (CPOUT, COUT)  The output capacitors should be located as close as  possible to the VOUT pin and CPOUT pin. A 2.2μF  capacitor for COUT and a 2μF to 10μF capacitor for  CPOUT are selected to get good dynamic performance.  For ceramic capacitor, temperature, DC bias and  package size will change the effective capacitance, so  enough margins of CPOUT and COUT must be considered  in design.    Fly Capacitor Selection (CFLY)  According to equation 2, the output voltage and  resistance will be affected by the capacitance of the  CFLY. If the users prepare to use the charge pump in  heavy load condition, it is recommended to set a larger  capacitor than normal to handle this situation. For  application, a 1μF ceramic capacitor is recommended  in application.    Thermal Shutdown  The SGM2066 can detect the temperature of die. When  the die temperature exceeds the threshold value of  thermal shutdown, the SGM2066 will be in shutdown  state and it will remain in this state until the die  temperature decreases to +145℃ (TYP).    Under-Voltage Lockout (UVLO)  The UVLO circuit monitors the input voltage to prevent  the device from turning on before VIN rises above the  VUVLO threshold. The UVLO circuit responds quickly to  glitches on the VIN pin and attempts to disable the  output of the device if either of these rails collapses.  The local input capacitance prevents severe brownouts  in most applications.    PCB Layout  To obtain better performance of the SGM2066, the  input and output bypass capacitors must be placed as  close as possible to the VIN, VOUT and CPOUT pins  separately. There are four high-current paths which are  GND, VIN, C1+ and C1-. The short and wide traces  must be used to connect these pins. R1 and R2 should  be placed as closed as possible to the VFB pin and the  short traces must be used. Keep CFLY away from the  VFB pin and traces is helpful for better performance of  the SGM2066.                            "}'
