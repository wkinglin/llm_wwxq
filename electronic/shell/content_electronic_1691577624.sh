This current mode control  device is optimized for high density applications with  minimal  number  of  external  components.  High  switching frequency, up to 2000kHz, can be chosen to  lessen the solution size by smaller inductor and  capacitors. This device can be used as a standalone or  tracking power supply. The SS/TR pin can be used to  control the output voltage startup ramp or as an input  for tracking.  Power supply sequencing for two or more power  supplies is possible by using the enable input (EN) and  the open-drain power good output (PG) signals.  The high-side MOSFET current is cycle-by-cycle  limited for overload protection. The low-side MOSFET  sourcing current is also limited to prevent current  runaway. The low-side switch also has a sinking  current limit that turns it off if an excessive reverse  current flows through it.  Thermal shutdown protection is activated to prevent  damage to the device when the junction temperature is  above the shutdown threshold.  The SGM61130 is available in a Green TQFN-3.5×3.5-14L  package.  "}'

An input pin for RT programming  resistor or external CLK input (auto select) for setting the switching frequency. In RT mode, an  external timing resistor connected between this pin and GND adjusts the switching frequency.  In CLK mode, an external clock sets the switching frequency.  2, 3  GND  G  Ground Pin.  4, 5  PVIN  P  Power Input for the Power Stage Switches. PVIN voltage can be lower or higher than VIN  voltage.  6  VIN  P  Power Input for the Control Circuitry.  7  FB  I  Feedback Input. Inverting Input of the Transconductance Error Amplifier.  8  COMP  O  Transconductance Error Amplifier Output. Connect the frequency compensation circuit  between this pin and GND.  9  SS/TR  I/O  Soft-Start and Tracking Input. Connect a capacitor between the SS and GND pins to set the  rise time of the internal reference voltage. A voltage applied on this pin (TR) overrides the  internal reference and the output will follow that voltage. This feature is used for tracking and  sequencing functions.  10  EN  I  Enable Input Pin with Internal Pull-up. Float this pin to enable the device or pull it down to  disable it. The EN input could regulate the input UVLO by a resistor divider from VIN or PVIN.  11, 12  SW  O  Switching Node Output of the Converter.  13  BOOT  I  Bootstrap Input to Supply the High-side Gate Driver. A bootstrap capacitor (0.1µF) is required  between the BOOT and SW pins. The voltage on this capacitor supplies the gate driver of the  high-side MOSFET.  14  PG  O  Power Good Open-Drain Output Pin. PG is released to go high by the external pull-up resistor  if the output is in regulation. It is pulled low during soft-start, when EN is low or during fault  events such as thermal shutdown, dropout or over-voltage.  —  Exposed  Pad  G  Package Exposed Pad and Analog Ground. This pad must be soldered to the ground plane for  proper operation and heat relief. Connect it to a PCB ground on the top layer that is only  connected to the GND pins and use it as reference for RT/CLK, COMP, SS/TR, UVLO setting  and VIN bypass.

The minimum achievable output voltage of  this converter is 0.8V, which is equal to the device  internal reference voltage (VREF).  SGM61130 can provide fast transient response with a  simple compensation circuit with constant frequency  and peak current mode control. The wide switching  frequency is adjustable from 200kHz to 2000kHz to  allow optimization of the efficiency and size of the  converter.  For  adjusting  the  internal  switching  frequency, an external resistor RRT is put between the  RT/CLK pin and GND. The device also accepts an  external clock source on this pin to synchronize the  oscillator using the internal phase locked loop (PLL).   This device has a safe and monotonic startup in output  pre-biased conditions. The VIN must exceed the  under-voltage lockout threshold (UVLO, 4.0V TYP) for  device power-up. The UVLO thresholds can be  adjusted (increased) by connecting the EN pin to the  tap point of a resistor divider between the VIN (or PVIN)  pin and GND. The EN internal pull-up current source  and the resistor divider determine the UVLO thresholds.  When the EN is floated or is pulled high, the device is  enabled and the total device current (no switching) is  near 1100μA. Pulling the EN pin low will shut down the  device with 3.4μA (TYP) supply current.  The integrated MOSFETs are optimized for higher  efficiency at lower duty cycles. They can efficiently  provide up to 4A continuous output current.  The integrated bootstrap circuit along with the external  boot capacitor provides the bias voltage for the  high-side MOSFET driver. The voltage of the bootstrap  capacitor that is placed between the BOOT and SW  pins is continuously monitored for bootstrap UVLO  (BOOT-SW UVLO) detection. If the boot capacitor  voltage drops below the bootstrap UVLO, the SW pin  will be pulled low to recharge the boot capacitor. 100%  duty cycle operation is possible as long as the boot  capacitor voltage is higher than the 2.5V (TYP)  threshold (preset UVLO level).  The device contains a power good (PG) pin which  indicates the status of the output voltage by comparing  the FB voltage and the internal reference voltage. PG  pin is connected to the drain of internal MOSFET. The  PG signal is high when VOUT is between 94% and 106%  of its nominal (set) value and goes low if VOUT drops  below 91% or rises above 109% of its nominal value.  The SS/TR (soft-start/tracking) pin can be used to  minimize the inrush currents (soft-start function) with a  small value capacitor, or for power supply sequencing  during power-up with a resistor divider from preceding  voltage rail. It is the input pin for the voltage that is  followed by the output when the power supply is used  in the tracking mode.  The SGM61130 is protected from output over-voltage,  over-current and over-heating damage. The output  over-voltage transients are effectively minimized by the  over-voltage comparator of the power good circuit.  When an over-voltage occurs, the high-side switch is  forced off and allowed to turn on again if the VOUT drops  below 106% of its nominal value.  High-side MOSFET is naturally protected from sourcing  over-current by peak current mode control. The  low-side MOSFET is also protected bidirectionally  against over-current. This feature helps the control of  the inductor current to avoid current runaway.  If a die temperature is too high (TJ > TSD), the device  will stop switching and go to shutdown state. It will  automatically recover with a soft-start when the junction  temperature drops 15℃ (TYP) below the shutdown  temperature.  Note that a continued overload condition may cause a  cycling thermal shutdown and recovery. It will depend  on the temperature and the ventilation conditions of the  system.       4.5V to 18V Input, 4A,   SGM61130  Synchronous Buck Converter      12  JULY 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued)  Power Input Pins  VIN and PVIN pins can be tied together or separated  depending on the application and minimum input  voltage. The VIN pin supplies the internal circuits of the  device and needs to be above 4.5V, while the PVIN  provides the supply voltage for the switches and can go  down to 1.8V. Therefore, if these pins are tied, the input  voltage range is from 4.5V to 18V. A voltage divider  connected to the EN pin from either VIN or PVIN can be  used to adjust the power supply UVLO. For a  consistent  power-up  behavior,  PVIN  is  the  recommended source for the UVLO programming.    EN Pin and UVLO Programming  The EN pin is used to turn the device on and off. The  device starts operation when the EN voltage rises  above the enable rising threshold. Pulling the EN  voltage below the enable falling threshold stops  switching and reduces the device current to the very  low quiescent shutdown level. Floating the EN pin will  enable the device due to its internal pull-up current  source. This current source is used for programming  the UVLO threshold. An open-drain or open-collector  output connected to the EN pin can be used to control  the device. An internal UVLO circuit is implemented on  the VIN pin to disable the device and prevent  malfunction when the supply voltage is too low. The  internal VIN UVLO hysteresis is 180mV. To program a  higher UVLO threshold for the VIN or to add a  secondary UVLO on the PVIN that is typically needed  for split-rail applications, the EN pin can be configured  to one of the configurations shown in Figure 3, Figure 4,  or Figure 5. Without external components, the internal  pull-up current (IP) sets the EN pin default state to  enable. When the device is enabled, the second  current source (IH) is activated. IP and IH are used to set  the UVLO.     Figure 3. VIN UVLO Setting with a Resistor Divider      Figure 4. PVIN UVLO Setting with a Resistor Divider   (VIN ≥ 4.5V)      Figure 5. VIN and PVIN UVLO Setting  The resistor divider can be calculated from Equations 1  and 2 based on the desired UVLO start and stop  thresholds. A 500mV or higher hysteresis (VSTART -  VSTOP) is recommended for the UVLO programming.

Soft-Start (SS/TR)  The lower voltage between the internal VREF and the  SS/TR pin is used as the reference to regulate the  output. The soft-start capacitor is connected to the  SS/TR pin and is charged by a 2μA internal current  source to set the soft-start time (tSS).  Equation 3 can be used to calculate the soft-start time  for a selected soft-start capacitor (CSS).  tSS (ms) =  CSS (nF) × VREF (V) ISS (μA)           (3)  where:   • VREF = 0.8V.  • ISS is the soft-start current source (2μA).

As long as the SS/TR pin  voltage is below VFB, the low-side switch is not allowed  to sink current to have a monotonic startup with  pre-biased output.    Reference Voltage (VREF)  A precise 0.8V reference is internally implemented by  scaling the output of a temperature-stable bandgap  circuit. The reference voltage tolerance over the whole  temperature range is ±1.5%. The actual reference  voltage for output setting is changed during startup or  tracking.    Output Voltage Setting  The output voltage of the device can be adjusted by  resistors R1 and R2 which are connected to the FB pin  (see Figure 1). Use resistors with 1% tolerance or  better for good output accuracy. The values of R1 and  R2 (upper and lower resistors) can be calculated by  Equation 4 based on the desired output voltage (VOUT)  and VREF.  R1 = VOUT - VREF VREF  × R2                          (4)  where:  • VREF = 0.8V.  For example, a 10kΩ resistor can be chosen for R2 and  then R1 is calculated. Do not choose too large resistors  that may cause output errors due to the FB bias current  or make the regulator susceptible to the noises coupled  to the FB input.  The minimal output voltage is determined by the  minimum on-time of the high-side switch. The maximal  output voltage is constrained by the bootstrap voltage.  More details are provided in the Bootstrap Voltage  (BOOT) and Operation with Low Dropout (100% Duty  Cycle) section.    Power Good (PG)  The PG is an open-drain output. It is released if there is  no fault and the FB pin voltage is in regulation. The PG  is pulled low if the FB voltage is lower than 91% or  above 109% of the reference voltage. When the device  is disabled by EN pin or the voltage of SS/TR pin is  under 1.3V (TYP), or if a fault such as UVLO or thermal  shutdown occurs, PG is also pulled low.  A 10kΩ to 100kΩ pull-up resistor connected to a  voltage rail less than 5.5V is recommended for PG. An  option is using the output voltage for PG pull-up. The  state of PG is valid only if the VIN > 1.8V. The current  sinking capability of PG is limited until VIN exceeds the  4.5V at which the full sinking capacity is available.    Frequency and Synchronization (RT/CLK)  The device can operate in two modes to adjust  switching frequency.   In the RT mode, a resistor (RRT) is placed between the  RT/CLK and GND pins to set the free running switching  frequency of the PLL. It can be set between 200kHz to  2000kHz by choosing RRT resistor between 240kΩ to  21.5kΩ respectively.  In the CLK mode, an external clock drives the RT/CLK  pin and the internal switching clock oscillator is  synchronized to CLK by the PLL. The CLK mode  overrides the RT mode. The device automatically  detects the input clock and switches to the CLK mode.    Constant Frequency PWM  The SGM61130 operates at fixed frequency that can be  set by an external resistor or synchronized by external  clock.  It is based on peak current control mode architecture.  The high-side MOSFET is turned on until the sensing  current ramp signal reaches the COMP voltage  determined by the EA. If the switch current does not  reach the reference value that generates from the  COMP voltage at the end of a cycle, the high-side  switch remains on for the next cycle until the current  meets the reference value. A slope compensation block  slightly reduces the sensed high-side switch current  before comparison (depending on the on-time) to avoid  sub-harmonic oscillations.    Continuous Current Mode (CCM) Operation  In most load conditions, the device operates in  continuous conduction mode (CCM) (forced PWM). For  light loads, the inductor current can be negative when  the low-side switch is on. However, if the current  reaches the low-side sinking current limit, the low-side  switch will be forced off.        4.5V to 18V Input, 4A,   SGM61130  Synchronous Buck Converter      14  JULY 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued)  Error Amplifier  The output voltage is sensed by a resistor divider  through the FB pin and is compared with the internal  reference. The error amplifier generates an output  current that is proportional to the voltage difference  (error), and the transconductance is 1450μA/V. The  generated current is then fed into the external  compensation network to generate the voltage on the  COMP pin, which sets the reference value for the peak  current that controls the on-time of the power MOSFET.  COMP is pulled down to the ground when the device  shuts down.    Slope Compensation  To avoid sub-harmonic oscillations that result in  unstable  PWM  pulses,  a  small  negative-slope  compensating ramp is added to the measured switch  current before it is used to generate the PWM signal.  The slope compensation has no influence on the peak  current limit which is maintained over full range of duty  cycle.    Output Over-Voltage Protection (OVP)  The device contains an over-voltage protection circuit  to avoid high overshoots of the output voltage during  operation. Usually an OVP occurs after removal of an  overload condition. When the output voltage is dropped  due to a persisting overload, the error amplifier output  reaches to its maximum and forces the converter to  provide the maximum output current. Upon removal of  the overload condition, the regulator output rises  quickly because the high inductor current charges the  output capacitor rapidly, especially if COUT is small. The  error amplifier will respond and re-adjust itself but not  as fast as the output filter (LC) and an overshoot  occurs.  To minimize the overshoots, the device monitors the FB  pin voltage and compares it to the internal OVP  threshold. If the threshold is exceeded, the high-side  MOSFET is turned off to stop feeding current to the  output. When the FB voltage drops below the OVP  threshold, the high-side MOSFET can turn on again in  the next cycle.    Over-Current Protection  Both high-side and low-side switches are protected  from over-current with cycle-by-cycle current limiting as  will be explained in the next two sections.     High-side Switch Over-Current Protection  Using current mode control, the pulse width (from the  beginning of the cycle until high-side turn-off) is  determined by the compensator output voltage (VCOMP  at COMP pin) in a cycle-by-cycle basis. In each cycle  the high-side switch current is continuously compared  with the current set point determined by compensator  output (VCOMP) and when the high-side current reaches  to that reference (peak current), the high-side switch is  turned off. Considering the internal delay and  inductance current slope, the actual current limit value  will be slightly larger than the value in Electrical  Characteristics section.    Low-side MOSFET Over-Current Protection  The current of the low-side switch is continuously  monitored while it is turned on. Normally, the low-side  switch sources current from ground to the load through  the inductor. Before the beginning of a new cycle, the  low-side current is compared to its current limit which is  normally lower than the high-side current limit. Only  when the low-side source current drops below its  current limit, the high-side MOSFET will turn on again  for the new cycle.  In some operating conditions, the low-side switch sinks  current from the load to the ground. If the low-side  sinking current exceeds the typical limit of 3.6A, the  low-side switch will immediately turn off and both the  switches will not turn on until the end of the cycle.    Thermal Shutdown  To protect the device from damage due to overheating,  a thermal shutdown feature is implemented to disable  the device when the die temperature exceeds +175℃  (TYP).  A new power-up sequence is  initiated  automatically once the temperature falls below +160℃  (15℃ hysteresis, TYP).       4.5V to 18V Input, 4A,   SGM61130  Synchronous Buck Converter      15  JULY 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued) Small Signal Model  Feedback Loop Small Signal Model  The equivalent small signal model of the control loop  for frequency response and transient analysis is given  in Figure 6.  The compensation network (R3, C1 and C2) is placed in  the output of the transconductance error amplifier (EA).  The EA can be simplified as an ideal voltage controlled  current source with 1450μA/V gain. The ROEA (6.9MΩ)  models the frequency response of the EA. Power  converter is modeled with a pure 15A/V gain. The  inductor dynamics is effectively removed in the  cycle-by-cycle average small signal model, because  with the current mode control the inductor average  current is set by the compensator. The COUT and RESR  model the output capacitance and its parasitic ESR. To  measure the frequency response, the loop is broken at  points ‘a’ and ‘b’ to insert a small signal (e.g. 1mV) AC  source. For small signal frequency response analysis,  the magnitude and phase versus frequency for the  output to input transfer functions of each stage is  plotted.  The  ‘a/c’  (power  stage  gain),  ‘c/b’  (compensation gain) and ‘a/b’ (loop gain) voltage ratios  are commonly used for the analysis. To simulate or test  the response of the output to load steps in time domain  (dynamic loop response), the load (RL) is replaced with  a stepping current source with proper amplitude,  repetition rate and rate of change (A/µs) depending on  the application. As a common example, stepping  between 25% and 75% of the nominal load with ±1A/µs  slew rate and repeating at 1kHz or 10kHz can be used  for testing and comparison of the power supply  transient response to rapid load changes.

Small Signal Model for Loop Response    Simplified Model for Peak Current Mode  A simplified small signal model to design the frequency  compensation network is given in Figure 7. The power  stage and duty cycle modulator are approximated by a  voltage-controlled current source (VCCS) that is  controlled by the error amplifier output (VCOMP) and  provides current to the output capacitor and the load.  The control-to-output transfer function (VOUT/VCOMP)  consists of a DC voltage gain (ADC), a dominant pole (fP)  determined by RL × COUT time constant, and a simple  ESR-zero (fZ) determined by RESR × COUT time constant  as given in Equations 5, 6, 7 and 8. The VCCS  transconductance is the ratio of the output current  change to the control voltage (COMP) change. This is  equivalent to the power stage transconductance (gmPS)  that is 15A/V for this device. As indicated in Equation 6,  for resistive loads, the DC voltage gain (ADC) is equal to  the power stage transconductance (gmPS) multiplied by  the load resistance (RL). Therefore, the DC gain drops  with the reduced load resistance. This relationship can  be problematic because it could move the crossover  frequency of the converter in the same way.

As highlighted in Figure  7, the crossover frequency (0dB gain location) is not  affected by the combined effect. With the decrease of  load current, the gain increases and the pole frequency  decreases. Having a fixed crossover frequency  simplifies the design of the frequency compensation for  a changing load.    Small Signal Model for Frequency  Compensation  The SGM61130 can easily use the common Type 2 and  3 compensation circuits, as shown in Figure 8.  Compared to Type 2B, the Type 2A compensation has  an extra high-frequency pole (by C2) to attenuate  high-frequency noise and ensure that gain remains  very low at high frequencies against the ESR-zero  effect that tends to increase the gain at higher  frequencies. In the Type 3 compensation, the additional  C10 capacitor is added in parallel to the upper feedback  resistor divider for phase Boost at the crossover  frequency. An extra resistor may be used in series with  C10 for more control on the phase Boost. The following  guidelines are provided for designers who prefer to  compensate by the standard loop design method.  These  equations  are  only  available  for  those  applications where the ESR-zero is higher than the  control loop bandwidth (crossover frequency). This  condition is usually valid when ceramic output  capacitors are used. For low frequency ESR-zeros  (capacitors with high ESR) see the Application  Information section for a detailed design procedure.

The first step is to determine the crossover frequency,  which is normally set to 1/10th of the switching  frequency.  COUT is also initially chosen based on the switching  frequency and ripple requirement.  2. R3 can be determined by:     R3 = 2π × fC × VOUT × COUT gmEA × VREF × gmPS                       (9)  where:  • gmEA is the gm amplifier gain (1450μA/V).  • gmPS is the power stage gain (15A/V).  • VREF is the reference voltage (0.8V).  3. A compensating zero should be placed at the  dominated  pole  of  the  device,  which  is  at  fP =  1  COUT ×   RL × 2π. C1 can be determined by:   C1 = RL × COUT  R3                          (10)  4. C2 is optional and adds a high frequency pole to  cancel the zero created by the output capacitor ESR.   C2 = RESR × COUT  R3                          (11)  5. C10 can be added for Type 3 compensation that  allows a slightly higher bandwidth and better phase  margin. If C10 is needed, use Equation 12.   C10 =  1 2π × R1 × fC                          (12)         4.5V to 18V Input, 4A,   SGM61130  Synchronous Buck Converter      17  JULY 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued)  Device Functional Modes  Switching Frequency Setting (RT Mode)  Selection of the switching frequency is generally a  tradeoff between the solution size, efficiency, and the  minimum controllable on-time. The RT resistance can  be designed from Equation 13.   RRT (kΩ) =  52407 fSW (kHz)  - 5        (13)    Figure 9. RT Resistance vs. Switching Frequency    Synchronization (CLK Mode)  The device uses an internal phase locked loop (PLL) to  set or synchronize to an external clock signal with the  200kHz to 2000kHz range. Mode change from RT  mode to CLK mode is allowed.  For stable synchronization, a square wave clock with  20% to 80% duty cycle must be applied to the RT/CLK  pin. The logic low and high levels of the clock must be  below 0.8V and above 2.0V respectively. The switching  cycle starts with the falling edge of the RT/CLK signal.  If both RT and CLK modes are needed in an application,  configuration shown in Figure 10 can be used. The RT  mode can be overridden by CLK mode when both RRT  and clock are present. Mode switch occurs when the  RT/CLK is pulled above 2.0V for the first time. Once  CLK mode is selected, the PLL is locked to external  CLK and the RT/CLK pin shifts to a high-impedance  state. Going back from CLK mode to RT mode is not  recommended, because by removing clock the  switching frequency drops to around 100kHz first  (waiting for synchronize clock) before recovery to the  free running frequency that is set by RT resistor.  RRT SGM61130 RT/CLK RT/CLK Mode Select   Figure 10. Using RT and CLK Modes Together    Bootstrap Voltage (BOOT) and Operation with Low  Dropout (100% Duty Cycle)  An integrated bootstrap regulator is used for powering  the high-side MOSFET gate driver. A small 0.1μF  ceramic capacitor (X5R or X7R grade) with at least 10V  rating is required between the BOOT and SW pins to  supply the gate driver. It is recharged from VIN source  through an internal switch every time the SW goes low.  Recharge happens when the BOOT pin voltage is less  than VIN and the BOOT-SW voltage is below the  required regulation for the high-side gate voltage.  The SGM61130 has no minimum off-time. It can  operate at 100% duty cycle as long as the BOOT-SW  voltage is higher than its UVLO threshold (2.5V TYP). If  the BOOT-SW voltage drops below its UVLO threshold,  the high-side switch turns off and the low-side switch  turns on to recharge the boot capacitor. If the input  voltage rails are split (separate VIN and PVIN sources),  the 100% duty cycle can be implemented continuously  as long as VIN is at least 4.0V above VPVIN.    Startup Sequencing (SS/TR)  The SS/TR, EN and PG pins allow the implementation  of common power supply sequencing methods. A  simple sequencing approach is shown in Figure 11 in  which the right side SGM61130 device is powered up  after the left one. The PG of the left device is coupled to  the EN pin of the right. The power supply on the right  side is enabled after the left supply reaches regulation.  EN SS/TR PG EN SS/TR PG SGM61130 SGM61130   Figure 11.

Note that VOUT2 is tracking  VOUT1 and reaches regulation first. Equations 14 and 15  can be used to calculate the tracking resistors. ∆V is  the desired VOUT1 - VOUT2 difference when VOUT2  reaches regulation. ∆V will be positive when VOUT1  change rate is higher than VOUT2 startup rate. It will be  negative if VOUT2 rate is faster. With simultaneous  sequencing, ∆V is zero.

If VIN pin is more than 200mm far from the PVIN of SGM61130, or the VIN pin is not connected with the  PVIN of SGM61130, or the input voltage is on/off by air-break switch, EC1 should be installed. Otherwise, the spike voltage over  20V at the input side is caused, which will damage the device.  Figure 14. 3.3V Output Typical Application Circuit    Design Requirements  In this example, a high frequency regulator with  ceramic output capacitors will be designed using  SGM61130 and the details will be reviewed. The design  requirements are typically determined at the system  level. In this example, the known parameters are  summarized in Table 1.  Table 1. Design Parameters  Design Parameter  Example Value  Output Voltage  3.3V  Maximum Output Current  4A  Transient Response 2A Load Step  ΔVOUT = 5%  Input Voltage Range  12V nominal, 8V to 18V  Maximum Output Voltage Ripple  33mVP-P  Input Turn-On Voltage (VIN Rising)  7.5V  Input Turn-Off Voltage (VIN Falling)  7.1V  Switching Frequency (fSW)  480kHz    Operating Frequency  Usually the first parameter to design is the switching  frequency (fSW). Higher switching frequencies allow  smaller solution size and smaller filter inductors and  capacitors and the bandwidth of the converter can be  increased for faster response. It is also easier to filter  noises because they also shift to higher frequencies.  The drawbacks are increased switching and gate  driving losses that result in lower efficiency and tighter  thermal limits. Also the duty cycle range and Buck ratio  will be limited due to the minimum on-time and/or  off-time limits of the converter. In this design, fSW =  480kHz is chosen as a tradeoff. From Equation 13 the  nearest standard resistor for this frequency is R3 =  100kΩ.           4.5V to 18V Input, 4A,   SGM61130  Synchronous Buck Converter      20  JULY 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued)  Inductor Design  Equation 18 is conventionally used to calculate the  output inductance of a Buck converter. Generally, a  smaller inductor is preferred to allow larger bandwidth  and smaller size. The ratio of inductor current ripple (∆IL)  to the maximum output current (IOUT) is represented as  KIND factor (∆IL/IOUT). The inductor ripple current is  bypassed and filtered by the output capacitor and the  inductor DC current is passed to the output. Inductor  ripple is selected based on a few considerations. The  peak inductor current (IOUT + ∆IL/2) must have a safe  margin from the saturation current of the inductor in the  worst-case conditions especially if a hard-saturation  core type inductor (such as ferrite) is chosen. During  power-up with large output capacitor, over-current,  output shorted or load transient conditions, the actual  peak current of inductor can be greater than IL_PEAK  calculated in Equation 21. For peak current mode  converter, selecting an inductor with saturation current  above the switch current limit is sufficient. The ripple  current also affects the output capacitor selection. COUT  RMS current rating must be higher than the inductor  RMS ripple. Typically, a 10% to 30% ripple is selected  (KIND = 0.1 ~ 0.3). Choosing a higher KIND value  reduces the selected inductance.  × × × INMAX OUT OUT 1 OUT IND INMAX SW    = V - V V L I K V f      (18)  In this example, KIND = 0.3 is chosen and the  inductance is calculated to be 4.68μH. The nearest  standard value is 4.7μH. The ripple, RMS and peak  inductors current calculations are summarized in  Equations 19, 20 and 21 respectively.

A  4.7μH  inductor  from  TDK  SPM10040T-4R7M with 8A saturation and 7.9A RMS  current ratings is selected for L1.    Output Capacitor Design  Three primary criteria must be considered for design of  the output capacitor (COUT): (1) the converter pole  location, (2) the output voltage ripple, (3) the transient  response to a large change in load current. The  selected value must satisfy all of them. The desired  transient response is usually expressed as maximum  overshoot,  maximum  undershoot,  or  maximum  recovery time of VOUT in response to a large load step.  Transient response is usually the more stringent criteria  in low output voltage applications. The output capacitor  must provide the increased load current or absorb the  excess inductor current (when the load current steps  down) until the control loop can re-adjust the current of  the inductor to the new load level. Typically, it requires  two or more cycles for the loop to detect the output  change and respond (change the duty cycle). It may  also be expressed as the maximum output voltage drop  or rise when the full load is connected or disconnected  (100% load step). The minimum output capacitance  can be given by Equation 22, which is needed to supply  or absorb a current step (ΔIOUT) for at least 2 cycles  until the control loop responds to the load change with  a maximum allowed output transient of ΔVOUT  (overshoot or undershoot).  × ∆ × ∆ OUT OUT SW OUT 2 I C f V  >                 (22)  where:  • ΔIOUT is the change in output current.  • fSW is the regulator's switching frequency.  • ΔVOUT is the allowable change in the output voltage.    For example, if the acceptable transient to a 2A load  step is 5%, by inserting ΔVOUT = 0.05 × 3.3V = 0.165V  and ΔIOUT = 2.0A, the minimum required capacitance  will be 50.5μF. Generally, the ESR of ceramic  capacitors is small enough. The impact of output  capacitor ESR on the transient is not taken into account  in Equation 22.         4.5V to 18V Input, 4A,   SGM61130  Synchronous Buck Converter      21  JULY 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued)  Equation 23 can be used for the output ripple criteria  and finding the minimum output capacitance needed.  VORIPPLE is the maximum acceptable ripple. In this  example, the allowed ripple is 33mV that results in  minimum capacitance of 9.43μF.  × × OUT ORIPPLE SW RIPPLE 1 1 C V 8 f I  >              (23)  where:  • VORIPPLE is the maximum allowable output voltage  ripple.  • IRIPPLE is the inductor ripple current.  Note that the impact of output capacitor ESR on the  ripple is not considered in Equation 23. Use Equation  24 to calculate the maximum acceptable ESR of the  output capacitor to meet the output voltage ripple  requirement. In this example, the ESR must be less  than 33mV/1.195A = 27.6mΩ.  ORIPPLE ESR RIPPLE V R I <              (24)  Higher nominal capacitance value must be chosen due  to aging, temperature and DC bias derating of the  output capacitors. In this example, a 3 × 22μF/25V  X7R ceramic capacitor with 3mΩ of ESR is used. The  amount of ripple current that a capacitor can handle  without damage or overheating is limited. The inductor  ripple is bypassed through the output capacitor.  Equation 25 calculates the RMS current that the output  capacitor must support. In this example, it is 345mA.  OUT INMAX OUT CORMS INMAX 1 SW V (V V ) I 12 V L f × − = × × ×         (25)    Input Capacitor Design  A high-quality ceramic capacitor (X5R or X7R or better  dielectric grade) must be used for input decoupling of  the SGM61130. At least 4.7μF of effective capacitance  (after deratings) is needed on the PVIN input and  similar amount is also needed for the VIN pin. If input  power is far away from this device, additional bulk  capacitor is recommended in parallel to stabilize input  voltage. The RMS value of input capacitor can be  calculated from Equation 26 and the maximum ICIRMS  occurs at 50% duty cycle. For this example, the  maximum input RMS current is 1.97A. The ripple  current rating of input capacitor should be greater than  ICIRMS.  OUT INMIN OUT CIRMS OUT INMIN INMIN V (V V ) I I V V × − = × ×       (26)  In this example, the voltage rating of capacitor should  have a safe margin from maximum input voltage.  Therefore, two 4.7µF/25V capacitors in parallel are  selected for PVIN to cover all DC bias, thermal and  aging deratings, and a 4.7μF/25V X5R capacitor is  selected for VIN. They are placed in parallel because  the VIN and PVIN inputs are tied together to operate  from a single supply in this design.   The input voltage ripple can be calculated from  Equation 27. The maximum ripple occurs at 50% duty  cycle. In this example, the input voltage ripple is  222mV.  × × × OUTMAX IN IN SW I D (1-D) ΔV  =  C f             (27)    Soft-Start Capacitor  The soft-start capacitor programs the ramp-up time of  the output voltage during power-up. The ramp is  needed in many applications due to limited voltage  slew rate required by the load or limited available input  current to avoid input voltage sag during startup (UVLO)  or to avoid over-current protection that can occur during  output capacitor charging. Soft-start will solve all these  issues by limiting the output voltage slew rate.   Equation 28 (with ISS = 2μA and VREF = 0.8V) can be  used to calculate the soft-start capacitor for a required  soft-start time (tSS). In this example, the output  capacitor value is relatively small (51μF) and the  soft-start time is not critical because it does not require  too much charge for 3.3V output voltage. However, it is  better to set a small arbitrary value, like CSS = 10nF that  results in 4ms startup time.   × SS SS SS REF t  (ms) I  (μA) C  (nF) =  V  (V)          (28)    Bootstrap Capacitor Selection  A 0.1μF ceramic capacitor with 10V or higher voltage  rating must be connected between the BOOT and SW  pins. X5R or better dielectric types are recommended.          4.5V to 18V Input, 4A,   SGM61130  Synchronous Buck Converter      22  JULY 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued)  UVLO Setting  The under-voltage lockout (UVLO) can be programmed  from VIN or PVIN by an external voltage divider  network. In this design, R1 is connected between VIN  and the EN pin and R2 is connected between EN and  GND (see Figure 14). The UVLO has two thresholds  (hysteresis), one for power-up (turn-on) when the input  voltage is rising and one for power-down or brown-out  (turn-off) when the voltage is falling. The turn-on  (enable to start switching) occurs when VIN rises above  7.5V (UVLO rising threshold). When the regulator is  working, it will not stop switching (disabled) until the  input falls below 7.1V (UVLO falling threshold).  Equations 1 and 2 are provided to calculate the  resistors. For this example, choose the resistors as R1  = 59kΩ and R2 = 11.5kΩ.    Feedback Resistors  The feedback resistor divider (see Figure 14, R5 and R6)  is used to set the output voltage. Choosing a 10kΩ  value for the lower resistor (R6), the upper resistor (R5)  can be calculated from Equation 29. The nearest 1%  resistor for the calculated value is 31.6kΩ. For higher  output accuracy, choose resistors with better tolerance  (0.5% or better).  R5 = VOUT - VREF VREF  × R6                          (29)    Minimum Output Voltage  There is a minimum output voltage limit for any given  input voltage due to the limited minimum switching  on-time of the device. Above the 0.8V minimum  possible output, the lowest achievable voltage is given  by Equation 30.  VOUTMIN = tONMIN × fSWMAX (VINMAX + IOUTMIN (RDSON_HMIN -  RDSON_LMIN)) - IOUTMIN (RL + RDSON_HMIN)   (30)  where:  • VOUTMIN = Minimum achievable output voltage.  • tONMIN = Minimum controllable on-time (105ns, TYP).  • fSWMAX = Maximum fSW (including tolerance).  • VINMAX = Maximum input voltage.  • IOUTMIN = Minimum load current.  • RDSON_HMIN = Minimum high-side switch RDSON (46mΩ  to 48mΩ TYP).  • RDSON_LMIN = Minimum low-side switch RDSON (34mΩ  TYP).  • RL = Output Inductor series resistance.    Loop Compensation Design  Several techniques are used by engineers to  compensate a DC/DC regulator. The recommended  calculation method here is quite simple and yields  results with high phase margins. In most conditions, the  phase margin will be between 60 and 90 degrees. In  this method the effects of the slope compensation are  ignored. Because of this approximation, the actual  cross over frequency is usually lower than the  calculated value.  First, the converter pole (fP) and ESR-zero (fZ) are  calculated from Equations 31 and 32. For COUT, the  worst derated value of 51μF should be used. Equations  33 and 34 can be used to find an estimation for  closed-loop crossover frequency (fC) as a starting point  (choose the lower value).   = × × OUT P OUT OUT I f 2π V C            (31)  = × × Z ESR OUT 1 f 2π R C            (32)  C P Z f f f = ×              (33)  SW C P f f f 2 = ×              (34)  For this design, fP = 3.78kHz and fZ = 3.12MHz.  Equation 33 yields 108.6kHz for crossover frequency  and Equation 34 gives 30.1kHz. The lower value is  30.1kHz, a slightly higher frequency of 38kHz is  selected for the influence of slope compensation in the  actual circuit.  Having the crossover frequency, the compensation  network (R4 and C4) can be calculated. R4 programs  the gain of the compensated network at the crossover  frequency and can be calculated by Equation 35.

The pole  frequency can be calculated from Equation 37.   = × × P 4 5 1 f 2π R C              (37)    Layout Guidelines   PCB  layout  is  critical  for  stable  and  high-performance  converter  operation.  The  recommended layout is shown in Figure 15.   Place the nearest input high frequency decoupling  capacitor between VIN and AGND pins as close as  possible.   Place a larger input ceramic capacitor close to PVIN  and GND pins for minimizing the influence of ground  bounce.   Use short and wide trace to connect SW node to the  inductor. Minimize the area of switching loop.  Otherwise, large voltage spikes on the SW node and  poor EMI performance are inevitable.   Sensitive signals like FB, COMP, EN, RT/CLK traces  must be placed away from high dv/dt nodes (such as  SW) and not inside any high di/dt loop (like capacitor  or switch loops). The ground of these signals should  be connected to GND pin and separated with power  ground.   To improve the thermal relief, use a group of thermal  vias under the exposed pad to transfer the heat to  the ground planes in the opposite side of the PCB.  Use small vias (approximately 15mil) such that they  can be filled up during the reflow soldering process to  provide a good metallic heat conduction path from  the IC exposed pad to the other PCB side.   Connect PVIN, GND and exposed pad pins to large  copper areas to increase heat dissipation and  long-term reliability. Keep SW area small to avoid  emission issue.   The dimension and outline information is for the  standard TQFN-3.5×3.5-14L package.             Top Layer  Bottom Layer  Figure 15.
