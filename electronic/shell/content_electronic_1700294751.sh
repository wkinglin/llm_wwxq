System reliability is significantly improved by such  integration compared to the designs with individual ICs  or discrete components. The SGM823 also features an  excellent transient immunity to ignore fast VCC  transients.  This device has an active-low push-pull reset output  (nRESET) that is activated by a logic low on the manual  reset input (nMR), a watchdog expiry event or due to a  low VCC voltage. The nRESET output can still be in the  correct logic state even if VCC is 1V. The SGM823 is  offered in four fixed VCC reset threshold voltages.  The SGM823 is available in a Green SOT-23-5  package. It operates over a junction temperature range  of -40℃ to +125℃.    "}'

The SGM823 supervisory circuit asserts a  reset  to  the  supervised  μP  to  prevent  the  code-execution errors that may occur due to power-up,  power-down, brownout conditions or other transients.  The nRESET output is still in the correct logic state  even if VCC is lower than 1V. During power-up, when  VCC exceeds the rising threshold voltage (VnRST + VHYS),  an internal timer keeps nRESET in low state for the  reset timeout period (tRP) before nRESET returns to the  high state (Figure 3).  If VCC drops below the falling threshold voltage (VnRST)  (a brownout condition occurs), a reset is asserted and  nRESET goes low. In general, nRESET remains low for  the tRP (200ms, TYP) period every time after the last  event. So, if during the low period of nRESET, VCC goes  up and dips below VnRST again, the internal timer will  restart for a new tRP period. The nRESET output can  source and sink current.    VCC 1V VnRST tRP tRD 1V VnRST + VHYS nRESET     Figure 3. nRESET Timing Diagram    Manual Reset Input  Many μP-based products need manual-reset capability  to let the operator or an external logic reset the μP. For  the SGM823, applying a logic low to the nMR input,  asserts a reset (nRESET = low). nRESET remains low  while nMR is low, and will stay low for the tRP (200ms,  TYP) period after nMR returns to high state. The nMR  input is internally pulled up by a 59kΩ resistor and can  be left floating if not used. It can be driven by a  CMOS/TTL logic or by a switch shorting to GND. A  normally open momentary switch connected between  nMR and GND pins can be used as a manual reset.  Switch debouncing is not needed. However, if long  cables are used to drive the nMR input or if the  environment is noisy, connect a 0.1μF capacitor  between nMR and GND to immune the additional  noise.    Watchdog Input  The internal watchdog circuit monitors the μP’s activity  by checking the WDI input. If the μP does not toggle the  WDI within the watchdog tWD (1.6s, TYP) period,  nRESET will send a low pulse to reset the μP. So, the  code should be written such that successive toggles on  WDI occur in periods not longer than the lowest tWD  time to reset the internal watchdog timer and prevent  μP reset when the code is running normally. The  watchdog timer is cleared by either toggling WDI or by  a pulse with a duration as short as 90ns. While the  reset is asserted and nRESET is low, the watchdog  timer is cleared and timer does not count. It starts  counting when the reset is released and nRESET goes  high (Figure 4).  To disable the watchdog function, leave the WDI pin  open. If WDI is driven by a 3-state buffer, set it to the  Hi-Z state. In this case the buffer leakage current  should not exceed 10μA. The maximum capacitance  seen on the WDI pin should be less than 200pF to  assure that watchdog remains disabled. The watchdog  input is internally oscillating when it is left open to clear  the watchdog timer and prevent it from generating a  reset. It is driven low during the first 7/8 of the watchdog  timeout period and driven high in the last 1/8 of that.  For example if WDI input is open and the watchdog  timeout is 1.6s, the watchdog timer will automatically  clear every 1.4s and reset will not occur.

The  low pull-up current of the SGM823 allows using of them  along with the microprocessors with bidirectional resets  like the 68HC11. The microprocessor can force  nRESET low when nRESET is pulled high by the  SGM823 with no issues (Figure 5).    nRESET μP VCC GND SGM823 Reset Generator VCC GND VCC VCC     Figure 5．Interfacing to μP with Bidirectional Resets    Negative-Going VCC Transient Immunity  The SGM823 has the ability to immune short time and  negative VCC transients or even glitches. It does not  need to shut down the entire system. Resets are  applied to the microprocessor during power-up,  power-down and brownout conditions and not when an  insignificant VCC transient occurs.  A 0.1μF ceramic capacitor is recommended between  the VCC and GND pin to reduce the input supply noise.    Watchdog Input Current  The WDI input is internally driven by a buffer and series  resistor from an internal counter chain stage of the  watchdog. Therefore, when WDI is open, the watchdog  timer is automatically cleared before timeout (by an  internal low-high-low pulse).  To get the minimum WDI input current (minimum power  loss), keep WDI low for the majority of the timeout  period and send a high pulse at the first 7/8 of the  timeout period for clearing the watchdog timer.      Watchdog Software Considerations  To have a more effective watchdog in software  monitoring, rather than generating pulses by a code  segment, set and reset the WDI input at different points  of the program code. For example, set it in the main  program and reset it in a periodic timing interrupt. For  example, if WDI is toggled within an unwanted infinite  loop, it will continuously reset watchdog as a normal  condition and the processor is not reset.  An example of a watchdog flow is shown in Figure 6.  The WDI is set high at the start of the program, and is  set low at the start of every subroutine or loop, then is  set high again when the program returns to the start. If  the processor hangs in any subroutine, the WDI  toggling will not occur and the watchdog will reset the  processor and correct the situation.  The nRESET output may also be connected to an  interrupt input of the μP for a corrective action if  preferred.  Note that such watchdog control schemes may not be  optimal if the total power consumption is critical as  discussed in the Watchdog Input Current section.
