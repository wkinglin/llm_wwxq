The device is  optimized for low voltage operation from 2.7V to 5.5V  single supply. It supports rail-to-rail input and output  operation. With 4mA output current, the output voltage  swing is within 195mV of the rails without external  pull-up or pull-down circuitry. The SGM8743 is suitable  for portable equipment. It can be compatible with  CMOS and TTL logics.  There are a lot of comparators switched frequently for  the linear region as the effect of noise and parasitic  parameters, and the condition of this negative situation  is when the one input of the comparator tends to reach  the other input voltage. In order to ease the effect of  noise and parasitic parameter, there is a 3mV internal  hysteresis inside the comparator.  There are two trip points which are made by the  comparator: the trip points when rising edge occurs and  the trip points when falling edge occurs. And the gap  between two trip points is the hysteresis of the  comparator. The offset voltage VOS is defined as the  average value of the two trip points. For the condition  which two inputs of the comparator are nearly equal,  the internal hysteresis will launch to avoid the  frequently switching at this case. For the normal  comparator other than SGM8743, the users usually use  external resistors connected at +IN pin to provide  hysteresis, while the internal hysteresis of SGM8743  can provide internal hysteresis without any external  component. However, if users need more hysteresis to  reject the influence of noise or parasitic parameters,  please add the external resistors at +IN pin to increase  the hysteresis.        Figure 1. The Waveform for Input and Output,   Non-Inverting Input Varied  On the condition shown in Figure 1, the -IN is fixed  while +IN is varied, and the corresponding output is  shown under the figure of input signal. However, if +IN  is fixed while -IN is varied, the output will be inverted.    Output Structure  In Figure 2, the SGM8743 has a push-pull output stage.  When output is changed from logic high/low to low/high,  the changed sink/source current pulls/pushes output  pin to logic low/high. Beginning this transition, larger  sink/source current is used to create a high slew rate  transit from high/low to low/high. Once the output  voltage reaches VOL/VOH, it will reduce the sink/source  current to a just right value to maintain the VOL/VOH  static condition. This current-driven push-pull output  stage will significantly reduce the power consumption in  application system.  If low slew rate transition is needed in system design,  adjusting the load capacitance will change the slew rate.  The heavier capacitive load will slow down the output  voltage transition. This feature will be used to reduce  the interference generated by fast edge of transition  between 1 and 0 in noise-sensitive system.        Figure 2.

This ceramic  capacitor must be placed as close to +VS pin as  possible.   For grounding, unbroken and low-inductance ground  plane is a good choice.   For Layout, use short PCB trace to avoid unwanted  parasitic feedback around the comparator.
