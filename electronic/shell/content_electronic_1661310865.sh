Connect a resistor between this pin and GND, for feeding  different voltages to select 6 different charge voltages.  3  CC  AI  Charge Current Programming and Charging Inhibition Input Pin. Connect a resistor between this pin  and GND for programming the constant charge current by ICHGREG = K·VREF/RCC. Pull up this pin to a  voltage higher than VCC_H (1.4V) to stop charging.  4  TS  AI  Temperature Sense Input Pin. Connect to the battery NTC thermistor that is grounded on the other side.  To program operating temperature window, it can be biased by a resistor divider between REGN and  GND. Charge suspends if TS voltage goes out of the programmed range. It is recommended to use a  103AT-2 type thermistor.  If NTC or TS pin function is not needed, use a 10kΩ/10kΩ pair for the resistor divider.  5  BAT  P  Battery Positive Terminal Pin. Use a 22μF capacitor between BAT and GND pins close to the device.   6  REGN  P  LDO Output that Powers LSFET Driver and Internal Circuits. Internally, the REGN pin is connected to  the anode of the bootstrap diode. Place a 1μF (10V rating) ceramic capacitor between REGN pin and  GND. It is recommended to place the capacitor close to the REGN pin.  7  BTST  P  High-side Driver Positive Supply. It is internally connected to the bootstrap diode cathode.

The devices have a low impedance power path that  improves the operation efficiency of the switch-mode,  reduces the battery charging time and extends battery life in  the discharging phase. The charging setting with the CC/CV  interface makes the device a flexible solution. These devices  include three main power switches: input reverse blocking  FET (RBFET, Q1), high-side switching FET (HSFET, Q2) and  low-side switching FET (LSFET, Q3). The bootstrap diode of  the high-side gate drive is also integrated to simplify the  system design.  The start and termination of a charging cycle can be  accomplished without software control. The sensed battery  voltage is used to decide the starting phase of charge in one  of the three phases of charge cycle: pre-conditioning,  constant current or constant voltage. When the charge  current falls below a preset limit and the battery voltage is  above recharge threshold, the charger function will  automatically terminate and end the charging cycle. When the  voltage of a charged battery is below the recharge threshold,  the charger starts another charging cycle.  The SGM41522 and SGM41522A have several safety  features, such as over-voltage and over-current protections,  battery temperature monitoring, input UVLO and thermal  shutdown. TS pin is connected to an NTC thermistor for  battery temperature monitoring and protection in charge  mode according to JEITA profile. This device also features  thermal regulation in which the charge current is reduced if  the junction temperature exceeds 110℃.    Power-On Reset (POR)  The internal circuit of the device is powered from the voltage  VVBUS. When the voltage of VBUS goes above its UVLO level  (VVBUS > VVBUS_UVLOZ), a POR happens and activates the  sleep comparator. Upon activation, the CC/CV interface will  also be ready for charge current and voltage settings.    Battery Charging Management  Battery Charging Profile  The SGM41522 and SGM41522A feature a full battery  charging profile with five phases. In the beginning of the cycle,  the battery voltage (VBAT) is tested and appropriate current  and voltage regulation levels are selected as shown in Table  1. Depending on the detected status of the battery, the proper  phase is selected to start or for continuation of the charging  cycle. The phases are trickle charge (VBAT < 2.19V),  pre-charge, fast-charge (constant current and constant  voltage) and fold-back mode.  Table 1.

The  termination current is programmed to ICHGREG/10 with a  minimum clamped value of 50mA (TYP). To fully charge a  battery, it is recommended to set the ICHGREG to be much  higher than 50mA. After the charging cycle is completed, the  converter enters fold-back mode.   The SGM41522 and SGM41522A have no battery switch but  provide an alternative way for battery safe and extended  battery life, which is the voltage fold-back mode when a  battery is fully charged while the input power is kept. This  alternative has less energy loss as no switch in the discharge  loop. The only penalty is that it could not support instant start  if the battery voltage is excessive low, in which condition it  takes a few more minutes for the load system to be ready for  start. When the device operates in FBM, the output voltage is  VFOLDBACK lower than VBATREG, and the output current limit is  ICHGREG_FOLDBACK (2.4A).    Compliance with JEITA Guideline  JEITA guideline (April 20, 2007 release) is implemented in the  device for safe charging of the Li-Ion battery. JEITA highlights  the considerations and limits that should to be considered for  charging at cold or hot battery temperatures. High charge  current and voltage must be avoided outside normal  operating temperatures (typically 0 ℃ and 60 ℃). This  functionality can be disabled if not needed. Four temperature  levels are defined by JEITA from T1 (minimum) to T4  (maximum). Outside this range, charging should be stopped.  The corresponding voltages sensed by NTC are named VT1 to  VT4. Due to the sensor negative resistance, a higher  temperature results in a lower voltage on TS pin. The battery  cool range is between T1 and T2, and the warm range is  between T3 and T4. Charge must be limited in the cool and  warm ranges.   One of the conditions for starting a charge cycle is having the  TS voltage within VT1 to VT4 window limits. If during the  charge, battery gets too cold or too hot and TS voltage  exceeds the T1 - T4 limits, charging is suspended (zero  charge current) and the controller waits for the battery  temperature to come back within the T1 to T4 window.   At cool temperature (T1 - T2) or at warm temperature (T3 -  T4), the charge current reduces to 10% of the charge current,  and the charge voltage is decreased by about 100mV  automatically.

Battery Thermistor Connection and Bias Network    The resistor bias network (see Figure 4) can be calculated  based on the following equations:       × × −     =     × − − × −         THCOLD THHOT T1 T4 T2 THHOT THCOLD T4 T1 1 1 R R V V R 1 1 R 1 R 1 V V   (1)      −     =    +         T1 T1 T2 THCOLD 1 1 V R 1 1 R R   (2)  where VT1 and VT4 are TCOLD and THOT threshold voltage on  TS pin as percentage to VREGN. Select TCOLD = 0℃ and THOT  = 60℃ for Li-Ion or Li-polymer batteries. For a 103AT-2 type  thermistor RTHCOLD = 27.28kΩ and RTHHOT = 3.02kΩ, the  calculation results are: RT1 = 5.18kΩ and RT2 = 29.34kΩ. The  standard value is 5.23kΩ for RT1 and 29.4kΩ for RT2.

Charger resumes its normal operation when the  voltage comes back below OVP limit.    Thermal Regulation and Thermal Shutdown  Internal junction temperature (TJ) is always monitored to  avoid overheating. A limit of +110 ℃ is considered for  maximum IC surface temperature in Buck mode and if TJ  intends to exceed this level, the device reduces the charge  current to keep maximum temperature limited to +110℃  (thermal regulation mode). As expected, the actual charging  current is usually lower than programmed value during  thermal regulation.  If the junction temperature exceeds TSHUT (+150℃), thermal  shutdown protection arises in which the converter is turned  off.  When the device recovers and TJ falls below the hysteresis  band of TSHUT_HYS (10℃ under TSHUT), the converter resumes  automatically.    Battery Over-Voltage Protection  The over-voltage limit for the battery is 4.5% above the  battery regulation voltage setting. Charging will immediately  disable if a battery over-voltage occurs.      Battery Over-Discharge Protection  To recover from over-discharge, an input source is required at  VBUS pin. The battery is charged with ISHORT (33.5mA TYP)  when the VBAT < VSHORT, or with a pre-charge current when  the battery voltage is between VSHORT and VBATLOW.    Charging Voltage Programming  Forcing a voltage on the CV pin, or grounding it with a resistor  that presents a similar voltage against the constant current  sourcing from the pin during charging selects 1 of 6 charging  voltages, as shown in Table 3.    Charge Current Programming and Turn-Off  Charge current is programmed by using different RCC  resistance or by providing voltage difference on the RCC by  forcing a voltage on the other end, which could be generated  by a DAC or PWM output.  Forcing the CC to a voltage higher than VCC_H (1.4V) turns the  device off.    Table 3.

Place the input capacitor between VBUS and GND pins as  close as possible to the chip with shortest copper connections  (avoid vias).   2. Connect one pin of the inductor as close as possible to the  SW pin of the device and minimize the copper area  connected to the SW node to reduce capacitive coupling from  SW area to nearby signal traces. This decreases the noise  induced  through  parasitic  stray  capacitances  and  displacement currents to other conductors. SW connection  should be wide enough to carry the charging current. Keep  other signals and traces away from SW if possible.  3. Place output capacitor GND pin as close as possible to the  GND pin of the device and the GND pin of input capacitor CIN.  It is better to avoid using vias for these connections and keep  the high frequency currents paths very short and on the same  layer. A GND copper layer under the component layer helps  reducing noise emissions.   4. Solder the exposed thermal pad of the package to the PCB  ground planes. Ensure that there are enough thermal vias  directly under the IC, connecting to the ground plane on the  other layers for better heat dissipation and cooling of the  device.
