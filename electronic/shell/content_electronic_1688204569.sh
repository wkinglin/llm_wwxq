Compared with the design using a  single IC or discrete components, this integration  design has the advantage of improving system stability  and accuracy. The SGM706B can be reset under  power-up, power-down or even voltage reduction  brownout conditions. When VCC is as low as 1V, the  reset output can still operate. And it also has a low-level  active manual reset nMR function.  The SGM706B provides an independent watchdog  monitoring circuit, which is activated when its WDI input  has not toggled for more than 1.6s.  When the power supply fails, the battery power is low,  or the additional power supply needs to be monitored, it  can be realized by the 1.25V threshold detector of the  SGM706B.  The SGM706B is available in Green UTDFN-1.5×1.5-8L,  SOIC-8 and MSOP-8 packages. It operates over an  junction temperature range of -40℃ to +125℃.    "}'

If the WDI remains high or low for longer than the  watchdog timeout period (1.6s, TYP), the internal watchdog timer will  expire and nWDO will go low.

The watchdog  feature is disabled if the WDI is left open or if it is connected to a  three-stated buffer output. If it requires the SGM706B to switch WDI from  normal state to disable state, ensure that the WDI enters the high-Z state  from high level.  7  7  1  nRESET  Active-Low Reset Output Pin. It delivers a 200ms (TYP) low pulse when  activated. nRESET will remain low if VCC is below the reset threshold or  nMR is logic low.

If WDI can not reach a rising edge or a falling edge  in 1.6s, the watchdog timer will timeout.

As long as VCC is higher than  the reset threshold, nWDO will immediately go high.

In addition, the internal reference  voltage accuracy of the SGM706B is very high, which  guarantees high reliability of the devices.  To ensure sufficient time for the power supply and  microprocessor to stabilize after power-up, a 200ms  (TYP) reset output will hold by the internal timer after  VCC exceeds the reset threshold voltage. Similarly, a  200ms (TYP) reset output will also exist after the power  supply recover from brownout or interruption that allows  the power supply and microprocessor to have enough  time to reach a steady state.  The SGM706B has an active-low nRESET output.  When VCC is as low as 1V during power-down, the  nRESET will keep output a low level. This not only  keeps the microprocessor shutdown when the supply  voltage falls, but also prevents the microprocessor from  occurring false actions when it powers up.    Watchdog  A watchdog timer is integrated in SGM706B. It must be  periodically triggered by a rising edge or a falling edge  of WDI. If the WDI cannot be triggered during the  timeout period (1.6s, TYP) and WDI is not three-stated,  the internal watchdog timer expires and nWDO goes  low.  The internal watchdog timer is cleared while a reset is  asserted or WDI is three-stated or WDI is fed on time  within the timeout period.    Manual Reset (nMR)  The SGM706B provides a manual reset (nMR) function  that allows users to reset the system manually. It is an  active-low reset input with an internal pull-up resistor of  25kΩ. When the nMR is low, and for tRS (200ms, TYP),  after nMR returns high, the reset remains active. The  nMR can be driven by a CMOS logic or by a reset  switch shorting to GND. If not used, leave it open or  connect it to the VCC. When the device is far away from  the reset switch or used in a noisy environment, a  0.1μF capacitor is recommended to connect between  nMR and GND.    PFI, nPFO  For SGM706B, PFI (Power-Fail Input) and nPFO  (Power-Fail Push-Pull Output) pins can be used for  power-fail warning or monitoring a power supply of the  other device, and do not affect nRESET pin.  The internal voltage reference (1.25V) is used for  compare with PFI pin. Once the PFI voltage is lower  than the negative-going input threshold voltage, the  nPFO  goes  low.  Once  PFI  voltage  exceeds  positive-going input threshold voltage, the output goes  high. Connecting a resistor divider externally can  monitor any voltages above 1.25V.  To ensure that the PFI leakage current can be ignored  in comparision with the current through the resistor  divider and to minimize the resistor power consumption,  the sum of two resistors should be about 1MΩ. To  ensure the accuracy of the detection voltage, the  tolerance of the external resistor should be less than  1%. It is recommended to leave nPFO floating and  connect PFI to VCC pin if the PFI comparator is not  used.         8-Pin Microprocessor Supervisory Circuit  SGM706B  with Watchdog Timer and Manual Reset      11  JUNE 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  "}'

And if a  high-impedance input is connected to nRESET, the  input voltage will drift and be undetermined. To solve  the problem, it is recommended to use a 100kΩ resistor  between nRESET and GND.  GND nRESET VCC VCC 100kΩ SGM706B   Figure 3. nRESET Valid to Ground Circuit    Monitoring Other Voltage Lines  Connect a voltage divider network to PFI and adjust the  ratio appropriately. nPFO can be used to monitor  another voltage line, which does not affect nRESET  pin.

Power-Fail Voltage Monitoring    Connect a voltage divider network to PFI and connect  nPFO to nMR can attain dual voltage lines monitoring  simultaneously. It asserts nRESET in the conditions of  5V supply, VCC falls below the reset threshold or the  12V supply falls approximately below 11V. Figure 5  shows the dual voltage lines monitoring of SGM706B  configuration.  SGM706B VCC nMR nPFO PFI nRESET +12V +5V 1MΩ 1% 130kΩ 1% To μC GND   Figure 5. Dual Voltage Lines Monitoring    PFI can also be used to monitor a negative supply rail.  The configuration is shown below. When the negative  rail is lower than some negative voltage which makes  VPFI between 0V and 1.25V, a low nPFO will not drive  the transistor to pull nMR low and nRESET will not be  triggered. When the negative rail is degraded, which  makes VPFI be higher than 1.25V, a high nPFO drives  the transistor to pull nMR low and trigger nRESET. And  the accuracy of this circuit is not high, depending on the  PFI threshold tolerance, VCC line and the resistors.

Connecting the  SGM706B nRESET output to μC RESET output directly  may cause race and hazard. For example, if nRESET is  logic high and the RESET is logic low, connecting them  directly may result in indeterminate logic levels, even  damage the RESET pin of μC.  Therefore, a 4.7kΩ resistor is recommended to be  connected between nRESET and the μC reset I/O as  show in Figure 7. Besides, buffer the nRESET output to  reset other system components.  µC SGM706B VCC nRESET GND VCC RESET GND 4.7kΩ Buffered nRESET to Other System Components     Figure 7.
