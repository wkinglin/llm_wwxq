When the input voltage drops to 100mV lower than the  output voltage, the chip will smoothly switch to Boost  mode. In Boost mode, the SGM3111 is used as a  constant frequency of 1.2MHz double charge pump.  When the input voltage rises above the regulated  output voltage, the chip enters a Buck mode, which can  be used for low dropout linear regulators to step down.  The soft-start circuit of SGM3111 can limit the inrush  current during startup. A current-limiting circuit and  thermal shutdown allow the device to accept a  sustained short-circuit of the output to ground. Low  operating current (60µA, TYP) during no-load operation  and ultra-low shutdown operating current (< 0.6µA)  make the device more power efficient.  The application of SGM3111 only needs three ceramic  capacitors with small package size. The SGM3111 is  available in a Green TDFN-2×2-6FL package.  "}'

When the input voltage is about 100mV  greater than the output voltage, it works in LDO state.  Once the input voltage falls to less than 100mV above  the output voltage, the device automatically switches to  charge pump mode to boost the output voltage to the  desired level. Voltage regulation is achieved by the  inside dividing resistor, and the output current of the  charge pump is adjusted according to the error signal of  error amplifier.  In charge pump mode, a non-overlapping two-phase  clock will enable the charge pump switch. In the first  phase of the clock, the flying capacitor is charged from  the input voltage. In the second phase of the clock, it is  in series with VIN and connected to the output capacitor.  The charging and discharging sequence of the flying  capacitor will continue to operate at a switching  frequency of 1.2MHz (TYP).    Shutdown Mode  In enable shutdown mode, all circuits stop working and  the chip only consumes leakage current from the VIN  pin. Also, the input and output voltages are completely  disconnected. nSHDN, a CMOS input, has a turn-on  voltage of about 0.8V. When the nSHDN pin is tied to a  low logic level, the SGM3111 circuit is completely shut  down. nSHDN is a CMOS high-impedance input pin  and must be driven by a valid level and cannot be left  floating.    Burst Mode Operation  When the chip works in charge pump mode and light  load, it can enter automatic burst mode operation,  thereby improving converter efficiency. Burst mode is  automatically entered when the load current is lower  than the internally set threshold. Once the chip enters  burst mode, it will enter sleep state and the internal  clock is turned off to reduce switching losses. The  device only consumes 60µA from VIN in this low  consumption state. When VOUT drops below the  threshold set by the comparator, the IC will re-run at the  normal operating frequency and continue to supply  energy to the output capacitor. If the output current  remains below the burst mode setting, the IC will restart  sleep mode. As VIN, VOUT, and the output capacitance  change, the burst-mode threshold will also change.    Soft-Start  The SGM3111 adopts soft-start mode when starting,  which can reduce inrush current. The soft-start circuit is  implemented by an internal setting, and the circuit  realizes that the load capacity of the output capacitor is  raised from 0mA to 300mA in about 0.5ms. The circuit  resets on thermal shutdown or power-down.    Short-Circuit Protection/Thermal Shutdown  The SGM3111 integrates the functions of over-  temperature protection and short-circuit current limiting.  When shorted, the output current is automatically  limited to around 300mA by the device. Once the  junction temperature (TJ) is above approximately  +160℃, the thermal shutdown circuit prevents current  from flowing to VOUT pin. When TJ falls below  approximately +150℃, the device resumes operation.  When an over-temperature condition occurs, the device  will cycle in and out of thermal shutdown without  damage or latch-up. When VOUT is no longer shorted,  the thermal shutdown mechanism is exited. Prolonged  thermal stress (i.e. working in an environment higher  than +125℃) is still avoided in use, as it will reduce the  operating time of the device and cause performance  degradation.             3.3V Buck/Boost  SGM3111  Charge Pump DC/DC Converter      9  JULY 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  "}'

Use  Equation 1 to caculate the efficiency. If VIN is 3.7V, IOUT  is 100mA and VOUT is 3.3V, then the calculated  efficiency (η) will be about 89% which is close to the  measured value of 89%.  When operating in a charge pump state, the efficiency  (η) of the SGM3111 is similar to that of an LDO with an  effective input voltage equal to twice the actual input  voltage. This is because the output current of the  voltage doubler charge pump is approximately one-half  the input current. In an ideal voltage doubler charge  pump, the efficiency calculation is given by:  × = = = × OUT OUT OUT OUT IN IN OUT IN P V I V η P V 2I 2V            (2)    At moderate to high output currents, the IC's quiescent  current and switching losses can be ignored. Use  Equation 2 to caculate the efficiency. If VIN is 2.5V, VOUT  is 3.3V, and IOUT is 100mA, then the calculated  efficiency (η) will be 66% which is close to the  measured value of 65%.    Effective Open-Loop Output Resistance (ROL)  Another important determinant of charge pump  strength is the effective open-loop output resistance  (ROL). The value of this resistor is affected by many  factors, such as the flying capacitor (CFLY), the oscillator  frequency (fOSC), and the ESR of the external capacitor  and internal switch resistance (RS), non-overlapping  time, etc. A first-order approximation of ROL is  calculated as:    = ≅ + × ∑ OL S S 1T04 OSC FLY 1 R 2 R f C           (3)    If the IC works in a charge pump state, use Equation 4  to caculate the maximum output voltage and the  available current as shown in Figure 3.  = IN OUT OUT OL 2V - V I R                (4)  where:  2VIN is the effective output voltage.  ROL is the effective open-loop output resistance.        Figure 3. Equivalent Open-Loop Circuit    Input and Output Capacitor Selection  The size and type of capacitors selected for the  SGM3111 determines several key parameters such as  output ripple, loop stability, start-up time, and charge  pump strength.   It is recommended to connect low ESR (< 0.1Ω)  ceramic capacitors on CIN and COUT to increase ripple  and noise immunty. The actual capacitance of CIN  should be at least 1µF, and the actual capacitance  value of COUT should be at least 4.7µF. It is not  recommended to use Aluminum or Tantalum capacitors  due to their higher ESR.  In the charge pump state, the size of COUT directly  determines the ripple size of the corresponding output  current. Larger COUT will reduce output ripple, however,  it also increase the minimum start-up time.   Use Equation 5 to caculate the peak-to-peak output  ripple approximately.    = × OUT RIPPLE(P-P) OSC OUT I V 2f C           (5)    where:  COUT is the actual output capacitor value.  fOSC is the oscillator operating frequency (1.2MHz, TYP).          + _ + _ IOUT ROL 2VIN VOUT      3.3V Buck/Boost  SGM3111  Charge Pump DC/DC Converter      10  JULY 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued)  In addition, the package and value of the output  capacitor will have a great impact on the stability of the  SGM3111. As shown in Figure 2, a linear loop control is  designed to adjust the strength of the charge pump in  order to the match the desired output current. The error  signal of this control loop acts directly on the output  capacitor through a linear loop. And the dominant pole  of the control loop is formed by the output capacitor. To  avoid instability or oscillation of the SGM3111, it is  necessary to keep the output capacitor larger than 2µF  under any conditions.  The larger ESR of the output capacitor will also affect  the chip loop stability. The designed SGM3111  closed-loop output impedance is 0.5Ω. When the load  current changes by 100mA, the output voltage will  fluctuate by about 50mV. When using a 0.5Ω or larger  ESR output capacitor, the closed-loop frequency  response will no longer drop through a simple  single-pole, which may result in poor load transient  response or loop instability. The characteristics of low  ESR  of  ceramic  capacitors,  combined  with  a  reasonable circuit board layout, will produce superior  transient response and good stability.  In charge pump mode, just as the output capacitor  affects the output ripple, the input capacitor also affects  the input voltage ripple. The chip maintains a relatively  constant input current during both the input charging  and output charging phases, and is zero during  non-overlapping times. Although the chip has a short  non-overlapping time (typically ~25ns), this state still  produces a small perturbation on the input power line.  Ceramic capacitors with low ESR will produce less  input noise than capacitors with higher ESR such as  tantalum capacitors. Therefore, it is necessary to  choose capacitors with good ESR performance, and  ceramic capacitors are still recommended here.  Inserting a smaller inductor at the input of the chip can  attenuate the input noise, as shown in Figure 4. A 10nH  inductor will attenuate the input current ripple so that  the current load on the input remains nearly constant.  Considering economic factors, a 10nH inductor can be  made from a PCB board, and the trace length is about  1cm (0.4').      Figure 4. 10nH Inductor Used for Additional Input Noise  Reduction    Flying Capacitor Selection  WARNING: Flying capacitors must not be used with  polarized capacitors (such as aluminum or tantalum),  as it will sustain reverse voltage when the chip starts up.  It is appropriate to choose a low ESR ceramic capacitor  as the flying capacitor.  The strength of the charge pump is controlled by the  flying capacitor. It is recommended to use at least 1µF  ceramic capacitors as flying capacitors. For VOUT =  3.3V and 1.8V ≤ VIN ≤ 2.5V, when a rated current of  40mA is required, a flying capacitor value greater than  0.5µF should be selected.  When the chip works in a very light load condition, the  flying capacitor value can be reduced to compress  space and reduce costs. The paragraph 'Effective  open-loop output resistance' gives a first-order  approximation of ROL, and the theoretical minimum  output impedance of the charge pump can be  calculated by:  = ≅ × IN OUT OL(MIN) OUT OSC FLY 2V - V 1 R I f C           (6)    where fOSC is the switching frequency (1.2MHz) and  CFLY is the value of the ﬂying capacitor. Due to the  on-resistance of MOS, the actual strength of the charge  pump will be smaller than the theoretical calculation.  However, when the load is relatively light, the startup  capacitor value can be obtained from the above  expression.

For example, in the range of -40℃ to  +85℃, the capacitance of X5R or X7R material will not  decrease much, but the capacitance of Z5U or Y5V  type capacitor will decrease significantly. Z5U and Y5V  capacitors have low voltage coefficients and their  capacitances decrease by 60% or more when rated  voltage is applied. Therefore, when comparing different  capacitors, it is usually more reasonable to compare  the actual capacitance value under the same package,  rather than the nominal capacitance value. For  example, the capacitance of a 4.7µF 10V Y5V ceramic  capacitor of 0805 package is only 25% of its rated  capacitance over the full temperature range and at 3.3V,  but the actual capacitance of a 4.7µF 10V X5R ceramic  capacitor under the same conditions can reach 80% of  the rated capacitance. The user should check the  capacitor manufacturer's manual to ensure that the  desired capacitance is obtained over the entire voltage  and temperature range.  Optional ceramic capacitor manufacturers are AVX,  Kemet, Murata, Taiyo Yuden, Vishay, TDK, etc.    Thermal Management  When the SGM3111 is used in the conditions of larger  output current and higher input voltage, the chip may  consume more power. When the junction temperature  of the chip exceeds about +160℃, the thermal  shutdown circuit will stop the chip output current. For  better heat dissipation, it is recommended that the chip  is in good contact with the copper layer of the board.  Connecting the exposed pad of the TDFN package and  GND (pin 1) together to the ground plane under the  board can effectively reduce the thermal resistance  between the PCB board and the package.    Derating Power at High Temperatures  In order to avoid overheating of the chip during high  current output, it is necessary to obtain the maximum  power consumption at different ambient temperatures  according to Figure 5.  The loss of the SGM3111 needs to be always less than  the power value corresponding to a given ambient  temperature. Chip losses in charge pump mode are  calculated by:  = × D IN OUT OUT P (2V - V ) I            (7)    The power dissipation in Buck mode is given by:    = × D IN OUT OUT P (V - V ) I            (8)      Figure 5. Maximum Power Dissipation vs. Ambient  Temperature    This derating curve is obtained assuming that the  maximum thermal resistance θJA of the TDFN-2×2-6FL  package is 106℃/W. This curve can be achieved by a  good connection between the ground plane of the PCB  and the exposed pad of the TDFN and the ground pin  of the chip.  It is recommended that the chip work continuously in  the region where TJ ≤ +125℃ , as shown in Figure 5. In  the range of +125℃ ≤ TJ ≤ +160℃ , the chip can work  for a short time, but it should be forbidden to work in  this area for a long time, because it may cause the  performance or life cycle of the device to decrease. In  the region of TJ ≥ +160℃, the chip remains in thermal  shutdown state.      0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 -50 -25 0 25 50 75 100 125 150 Power Dissipation (W)  Temperature (℃)  θJA = 106℃/W             Thermal Shutdown TJ = +160℃             Recommended Operation TJ = +125℃       3.3V Buck/Boost  SGM3111  Charge Pump DC/DC Converter      12  JULY 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued)  Layout Guidelines  Due to the high transient current and switching  frequency of this chip, a reasonable board layout is  required to achieve superior performance.
