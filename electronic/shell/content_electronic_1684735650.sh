The device features a wide common mode  voltage range from -0.1V to 26V. It also offers a low  offset, which allows 10mV full-scale maximum drops  across the shunt when sensing current.  The SGM8199 series provides three fixed gains: 20V/V,  50V/V and 100V/V. It operates from 2.7V to 26V single  supply, consuming only 85µA quiescent current.  The SGM8199 series is available in a Green SC70-6  package. It is specified over the extended -40℃ to  +125℃ temperature range.    "}'

curl -XPOST 'http://localhost:9200/electronic_products/_create/6448' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"product_name": "SGM8199", "table_name": "APPLICATION INFORMATION", "content": "APPLICATION INFORMATION  Recommended Connection  The recommended connection of SGM8199 is shown in  Figure 1. Also, it is recommended that the shunt  resistor should be placed as close as possible to the  two input pins of the current shunt monitor, so the extra  resistance which is series with the measured shunt  resistor will be reduced.  The bypass capacitor is necessary for the current shunt  monitor to improve its stability. In most applications, the  power supply is noisy and it will affect the operation of  SGM8199, so the bypass capacitor is needed in this  case.    Power Supply  The SGM8199 can accurately measure the current  when the common mode voltage exceeds the power  supply voltage presented at the VCC pin. For example,  the VCC power supply can be 5V and the load or  common mode power supply voltage is allowed to  reach up to 26V. The output voltage range is limited by  the level of the power supply.    Selection of RSHUNT  For the typical range of the differential input, the current  shunt monitor of SGM8199 can work accurately with the  order of 10mV. The application of SGM8199 series will  determine the selection of the shunt resistor RSHUNT. Also,  the users should consider the trade-off between voltage  loss and the accuracy of small input signals. The effect  of offset can be minimized by using high values of  RSHUNT, while the voltage loss can be minimized by  using low values of RSHUNT. For most applications, a  voltage drop of 60mV over RSHUNT is the appropriate  range for the selection of RSHUNT, and the corresponding  offset voltage is 350μV only.    Unidirectional Application  In unidirectional operation, the current measuring  direction of SGM8199 is fixed. Usually, the REF pin is  connected directly to GND pin to ensure that the output  is biased at 0V. Also, if the users desire to measure low  input voltage with high accuracy, biasing REF pin to  300mV is a good method to set the current shunt  monitor to its linear region.   For the least frequent case, REF pin can connect to the  power supply pin directly to measure the negative  current. In this case, the output voltage is equal to the  voltage of power supply when input voltage is equal to  0mV.    Bidirectional Application  Bidirectional application indicates that the current shunt  monitor of SGM8199 can measure the current for two  different directions. For this special case, the REF pin  can be set anywhere between 0V to VCC for the bias of  output voltage. For simplification, it is recommended  that VREF = VCC/2 is a typical voltage point. However, if  the absolute values of positive and negative current are  not equal, the voltage of REF pin should be set other  than VCC/2.    Input Filtering  It is not recommended to add a filter at the output of  SGM8199, as doing so increases impedance seen at  the output of the internal buffer. Filtering at the input  pins will be a good choice as long as the change of the  input impedance is taken in account. Figure 2 indicates  the application of input filtering.    For minimizing the error and enhancing the accuracy of  the result, the resistance of the external resistor RS  should be less than 10Ω.At the internal input structure  of SGM8199, there is a bias network which causes  mismatch in the bias current IB of two input pins, and  the external resistors result in the mismatch of voltage  drops (because of the mismatch of IB) across RS so that  the differential error will be created. Also, this differential  error will be reflected to the input pins of the current  shunt monitor and result in the accuracy. However, the  bias current difference can result in little effect on the  operation of the current shunt monitor so the users do  not need to care about that.        Figure 2.

However, the users may concern about the amount of  current through SGM8199 in shutdown mode. The  schematic in Figure 3 can be used to evaluate the  amount of current drain in shutdown mode.

Shutting Down the Current Shunt Monitor with VREF = 0      Input Impedance of REF Input  The common mode rejection ratio (CMRR) can be  influenced by the input impedance of REF Pin, but the  users do not need to concern about it if REF pin is  driven by a power supply. However, if the REF pin is  driven by resistive dividers, it should be buffered by an  operational amplifier to provide low input impedance.  If the output can be measured differentially, for example,  a differential analog-to-digital converter, the users do  not need to care about the external impedance which is  added at the REF pin and the effect can be removed.  Figure 4 indicates an example about how to remove the  effect of extra impedance at REF pin.        Figure 4.

At this case, a  Zener diode or Zener-type transient absorber (Transzorbs)  can be used to prevent the current shunt monitor from  over-voltage during the transient of power-on. It does  not recommend the users to use the transient absorber  other than Transzorbs because of the significant time  delay. However, any Zener diode needs extra operational  resistors to provide the operating current, so the 10Ω  resistors are selected (any large external resistor will  affect the gain). Also, 10Ω resistors and a Zener diode  with lowest rating of power are enough for handling the  short-term transient in most applications.      Figure 5. Using Dual Diodes for Absorbing Supply  Transient    If the low power Zener diode cannot protect the current  shunt monitor from supply transient, a Transzorb with high  power must be taken into account in this case. In Figure 6,  for saving the space of PCB board, a Transzorb and  back-to-back diode can also be used to absorb the  transient. For the applications of Figure 5 and Figure 6,  the total area which is occupied by SGM8199 itself and  its protective components is equivalent to the MSOP-8  package, and smaller than SOIC-8 package.      Figure 6.
