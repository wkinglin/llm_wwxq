This device is  capable to provide an input voltage supply range of  2.5V to 5.5V. The 6MHz fixed frequency operation  allows the use of a 470nH output inductor and a  4.7μF output capacitor.   The SGM6022 operates in power-save mode under  moderate and light load conditions through pulse  frequency modulation (PFM). The 22μA typical  quiescent current and the power-save mode can  further improve the system efficiency which can  reach a maximum of 90%. The SGM6022 also has  excellent load transient response capability. Its  output could be programmed to four different  voltages, as well as two different on/off delay times,  making it ideal for designing primary supplies. The  SGM6022 also includes the features of internal  soft-start, input under-voltage lockout, thermal  shutdown and overload protection.  The SGM6022 is available in a Green TDFN-2×2-6L  package.

The SGM6022  integrates a synchronous rectifier to improve the  conversion efficiency up to 90% peak, while PFM mode  light load efficiency reaches over 80% at 1mA load.   The device operates with 6MHz switching frequency at  PWM mode which significantly reduces the external  components size. The device only needs a 470nH  inductor and 4.7μF as the output capacitor.  Control Scheme  The SGM6022 adopts the COT architecture to regulate  the output voltage while maintaining excellent load  transient response. The device’s internal frequency  loop keeps the switching frequency constant at 6MHz  throughout the input voltage range and load current.  The device allows the use of low ESR ceramic  capacitor to maintain output voltage regulation.   At light load, the SGM6022 automatically operates in  PFM mode to achieve high light load efficiency. The  device can seamlessly transit to PFM, DCM or CCM  based on the load current.   Soft-Start  Toggling the EN pin above the 1.5V rising threshold,  the device starts switching with an internal soft-start  time. During start-up, the internal reference voltage is  slowly ramped up to the 0.8V reference voltage to  prevent any output voltage overshoot and reduce the  inrush current drawn from the input.   The current limit protection is active during soft-start,  the device might not start up properly if heavy load is  applied during start-up.  Current Limit, Fault Shutdown and Restart  Output short-to-ground or output over-current will  cause the peak inductor current flowing through the  high-side switch to reach the current limit. If the current  limit is triggered, the device stops switching, turning off  the high-side FET to prevent the inductor current from  continuing to rise. During the over-current event, the  regulator shuts down for about 1.3ms, and the soft-start  circuit attempts to restart for 200μs. If the over-current  event remains, this pattern repeats, and the device  automatically  resumes  operation  if  over-current  condition is removed.  Effective Pulse at VS Pin  A pulse with width less than tPULSE is treated as an  effective pulse. Consecutive pulses will be counted if  delay between adjacent pulses is within the tSTOP.  Please refer to Figure 2 for a graphical explanation.      Figure 2. Effective Pulse at VS Pin      200µs < tPULSE <2ms 200µs < tPULSE <2ms  6MHz, 600mA Synchronous  SGM6022  Buck Regulator      9  JUNE 2022  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  OPERATION DESCRIPTION (continued)  VS Pin Interface Functions  In order to enable the IC from shutdown mode, two  conditions must be met:  1. VIN voltage is higher than UVLO threshold.  2. VS pin is floating or VS pin stays logic high for at  least tBLANK + tSS time.   After that, the pulses at VS pin become effective and  can be used to shut down the IC or program the output  voltage. The following are the three cases that the VS  pin affects the regulator:  1. 1 pulse followed by VS pin being low for longer than  tOFF will shut down the regulator.  During the tOFF-HOLD time after shutdown, the pulses  applied to VS Pin are ignored.  To restart the regulator, the VS pin must be pulled high  for at least tSS time.  2. 2~5 pulses followed by VS pin being high for longer  than tOFF will set the output voltage to the default, V1,  V2 and V3 respectively.  3. 2 or more pulses followed by VS pin being low for  longer than tOFF will set the output voltage to the default  value.  Other pulse patterns will have no effects on the IC.        Figure 3. Program Output Voltage via VS Pin    Under-Voltage Lockout (UVLO)  The SGM6022 implements input voltage UVLO to stop  device operation when the input voltage drops below  the UVLO threshold. The device cannot restart again  until the input voltage raises higher than the additional  150mV (TYP) hysteresis.  Thermal Shutdown (TSD)  A thermal shutdown function is implemented to prevent  damage caused by excessive heat and power  dissipation. Once a temperature of typically +160°C is  exceeded, the device is shut down. The device is  released from shutdown automatically when the  junction temperature decreases by +15℃.      tOFF tSS tOFF-HOLD Default tSTOP tSTOP tSTOP tSTOP tBLANK Default Default tSTOP tSS VCC VOUT VS V3 V2 Output default voltage Setting VS low for longer than  tOFF after one pulse at VS pin,  the regulator will shut down.

The selected inductor should have at least 80% of the  inductance at ILIM(PK).  Inductor’s DCR and inductance affect the conversion  efficiency.

Poor layout could result in system  instability, EMI failure, and device damage. Thus, place  the inductor, input and output capacitors as close to the  IC as possible, and use wide and short traces for  current carrying traces to minimize PCB inductance.  For Buck converter, the input capacitor’s current loop  from VIN pin back to the GND pin of the device should  be as small as possible.         Figure 4.
