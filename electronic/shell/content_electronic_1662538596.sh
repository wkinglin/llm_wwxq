If the pole-frequency  is less than or comparable to the unity-gain bandwidth  (15MHz), the phase margin will be reduced, ringing in  the step response or sustained oscillation will be  generated.

One resistor is selected to limit the  current not to exceed the maximum rating value. In  Figure 4, a series input resistor is used to limit the input  current to less than 10mA, but the drawback of this  current-limit resistor is to contribute thermal noise at the  amplifier input.

In single power supply application, for example, when  +VS = 5V, -VS = GND, 2kΩ load resistor is tied from  OUT pin to VS/2, the typical output swing range is from  0.007V to 4.993V.    Driving Capacitive Loads  The SGM8558-2XG is designed for unity-gain stable for  capacitive load up to 780pF. In Figure 5, it shows the  transient response with capacitive load (CL). If greater  capacitive load must be driven in application, the circuit  in Figure 6 can be used. In this circuit, the IR drop  voltage generated by RISO is compensated by feedback  loop.

Circuit to Drive Capacitive Load    Power Supply Decoupling and Layout  A clean and low noise power supply is very important in  amplifier circuit design, besides of input signal noise,  the power supply is one of important source of noise to  the amplifiers through +VS and -VS pins. Power supply  bypassing is an effective method to clear up the noise  at power supply, and the low impedance path to ground  of decoupling capacitor will bypass the noise to GND.  In application, 10μF ceramic capacitor paralleled with  0.1μF or 0.01μF ceramic capacitor is used in Figure 7.
