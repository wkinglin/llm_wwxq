The wide input voltage range and power  supply range make the device a good choice for industrial  equipment. Open-drain structure needs external pull-up  resistor. The SGM8774-1 can be compatible with  CMOS and TTL logics.    Output Structure  In Figure 1, the SGM8774-1 has an open-drain output  stage. When output is changed from logic high to low,  the changed sink current pulls output pin to logic low.  Beginning this transition, larger sink current is used to  create a high slew rate transit from high to low. Once  the output voltage reaches VOL, it will reduce the sink  current to a just right value to maintain the VOL static  condition. This current-driven open-drain output stage  will significantly reduce the power consumption in  application system.  If low slew rate transition is needed in system design,  adjusting the load capacitance will change the slew rate.  The heavier capacitive load will slow down the output  voltage transition. This feature will be used to reduce  the interference generated by fast edge of transition  between 1 and 0 in noise-sensitive system.        Figure 1. Open-Drain Output Structure        "}'
