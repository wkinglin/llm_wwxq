The device suits various  applications of industry, which demands power  conditioning from unregulated sources. A 140mΩ RDSON  MOSFET is integrated as high-side switch. The ultra-low  50μA (TYP) quiescent current and low shutdown current  of only 2μA (TYP) make it a suitable choice for  battery-powered applications. Switching frequency can  be selected over a wide range (200kHz to 2500kHz) to  allow  desired  tradeoff  between  efficiency  and  component sizes. There is also the internal loop  compensation that simplifies compensation network  design, and requires less external components, saving  user design time and cost. With precision enable input,  regulator control is simplified, as well as system power  sequencing. Protection against over-voltage transient is  provided to limit the startup or other transient  overshoots. Secure operation in overload conditions is  ensured by thermal shutdown protection and cycle-by-  cycle current limit.  The SGM61630 is available in a Green SOIC-8 (Exposed  Pad) package.    "}'

The  minimum operating input voltage of the device is 4.3V.  The quiescent current is 50μA (TYP). When the device  is disabled, the shutdown current reduces to 2μA.  The SGM61630 uses peak current mode control with  power-save mode at light loads to achieve high  efficiency. The device is internally compensated, which  reduces design time.  The EN pin is internally pulled up by a current source  that can keep the device enable if EN pin is floating. It  can also be used to increase the input UVLO threshold  using a resistor divider.  The bootstrap diode is integrated and only a small  capacitor between BOOT and SW pins (CBOOT) is  needed for the N-MOSFET gate driving bias. A  separate UVLO circuit monitors CBOOT voltage and  turns the high-side switch off if this voltage falls below a  preset threshold.  The switching frequency is adjusted using a resistor to  ground connected to the RT/SYNC pin. It is also can be  synchronized to an external clock signal with 210kHz to  2400kHz.  Over-voltage protection (OVP) circuit is designed to  minimum the output over-voltage transients. When this  comparator detects an OVP (VFB > 110% × VREF), the  switch is kept off until the VFB falls below 107% of the  VREF. The SS pin internal current source allows  soft-start time adjustments with a small external  capacitor.  During  startup  and  over-current,  the  frequency is reduced (frequency fold-back) to allow  easy maintenance of low inductor current. The thermal  shutdown provides an additional protection in fault  conditions.    Minimum Input Voltage (4.3V) and UVLO  The recommended minimum operating input voltage is  4.3V. It may operate with lower voltages that are above  the VIN rising UVLO threshold (3.85V TYP). If VIN falls  below its falling UVLO threshold, the device will stop  switching.  Enable Input and UVLO Adjustment  An internal current source pull-up keeps the EN pin  voltage at high state by default. The device will enable  if the EN pin voltage exceeds the enable threshold of  1.17V and VIN exceeds its UVLO threshold. The device  will disable if the EN voltage is externally pulled low or  the VIN pin voltage falls below its UVLO threshold.  If an application requires a higher VIN UVLO threshold,  an  external  VIN  UVLO  adjustment  circuit  is  recommended in Figure 3. Figure 3 shows how UVLO  and hysteresis are increased using REN1 and REN2. A  3.7μA additional current is injected to the divider when  EN pin voltage exceeds VENH (1.17V TYP) to provide  hysteresis and it will be removed when EN pin voltage  is below VENL (1.12V TYP). Use Equations 1 and 2 to  calculate these resistors. VSTART is the input start  (turn-on) threshold voltage and VSTOP is the input stop  (turn-off) threshold voltage.

There is an internal bias  voltage (0.5V TYP) on the RT/SYNC pin during the RT  mode and must have a resistor to ground to set the  switching frequency. Use Equation 3 to find the RT  resistance for any desired switching frequency (fSW).  ( ) ( ) -0.918 SW T f kHz =17700 R kΩ ×         (3)    Synchronization to RT/SYNC Pin  The internal oscillator also can synchronize to an  external logic clock applied to the RT/SYNC pin (see  Figure 4) in the 210kHz to 2400kHz range. The SW  rising edge (switch turn-on) is synchronized with the  SYNC falling edge. The SYNC low and high levels must  be less than 0.3V and more than 2.0V and have a pulse  width larger than 30ns. So when the SYNC source is  removed, the DC resistance seen between the  RT/SYNC and GND pins determines the default  switching frequency (fSYNC).    Figure 4. Synchronization to External Clock    Low Dropout Operation and Bootstrap  Gate Driving (BOOT Pin)  An internal regulator provides the bias voltage for gate  driver using a 0.1μF ceramic capacitor. X5R or better  dielectric types are recommended. The capacitor must  have a 10V or higher voltage rating. The BOOT  capacitor is refreshed when the high-side switch is off  and the external low-side diode conducts.  The SGM61630 operates at maximum duty cycle when  input voltage is closed to output voltage if the bootstrap  voltage (VBOOT - VSW) is greater than its UVLO threshold.  When the bootstrap voltage falls below the UVLO  threshold, the high-side switch is turned off, and the  integrated low-side switch is turned on to recharge the  BOOT capacitor. After the recharge, the high-side  switch is turned on again to regulate the output.    External Soft-Start Adjustment  (SGM61630A Only)  The SGM61630A has an external soft-start (SS) pin for  adjustable startup time. It is recommended to add a  soft-start capacitor (CSS) between the SS and GND pins  to set the soft-start time. The internal ISS = 3μA current  charges CSS and provides a linear voltage ramp on the  SS pin. Use Equation 4 to calculate the soft-start time.  × SS REF SS SS C  (nF) V  (V) t  (ms) =  I  (μA)           (4)    Power-Good (SGM61630B Only)  The SGM61630B has a power-good (PGOOD) pin for  indicate whether the output voltage in the desired level.  The PGOOD pin is open-drain output that requires 10kΩ  to 100k Ω resistor pulled up to an DC voltage(not  exceeds 5V).  As shown in Figure 5, when the FB voltage is within the  power-good range, the PGOOD switch is turned off and  the PGOOD pin is pulled up to high. When the FB  voltage is outside the power-good range, the PGOOD  switch is turned on and the PGOOD pin is pulled down  to low.    Figure 5.

To avoid sub-harmonic  oscillations in this device, an internal compensation  ramp is added to the measured switch current before  comparing it with the control signal by the PWM  comparator.    Power-Save Mode  At light loads the SGM61630 enters Pulse-Skipping  Mode (PSM) to keep its high efficiency by lowering the  number of switching pulses. When the peak inductor  current  is  below  PSM  current  threshold,  the  corresponding internal COMP voltage (VCOMP) will be  lower than 410mV. The device will enter PSM in such  conditions. In PSM mode, VCOMP is internally clamped  at 350mV that inhibits the high-side MOSFET switching,  the device draws only 50μA (TYP) input quiescent  current. The device can exit PSM if VCOMP rises above  410mV.     Over-Current Protection and Frequency  Fold-back  Over-current protection (OCP) is naturally provided by  current mode control. In each cycle, the HS current  sensing starts a short time (blanking time) after the HS  switch is turned on. The sensed HS switch current is  continuously compared with the current limit threshold  and when the HS current reaches to that threshold, the  HS switch is turned off. If the output is overloaded, VOUT  drops and VCOMP is increases by EA to compensate that.  However, the EA output (VCOMP) is clamped to a  maximum value.  The natural OCP of the peak current mode control may  not be able to provide a complete protection when an  output short-circuit occurs and an extra protection  mechanism for short-circuit is needed. During an output  short,  inductor  current  may  runaway  above  over-current limits because of the high input voltage  and the minimum controllable on-time. During the  output short, the inductor current decreases slowly  because a small negative diode forward voltage  appears across the inductor during the off-time, as a  result the inductor current cannot be reset. In these  conditions, current can saturate the inductor and the  current may even increase higher until the device is  damaged. In the SGM61630, this problem is effectively  solved by increasing the off-time during short-circuit by  reducing the switching frequency (frequency fold-back).  As the output voltage drops and the FB pin voltage falls  from 0.75V to 0V, the frequency will be divided by 1, 2,  4 and 8.    Over-Voltage Transient Protection  When an overload or an output fault condition is  removed, large overshoots may occur on the output.  The SGM61630 includes OVP circuit to reduce such  over-voltage transients. If VFB voltage exceeds 110% of  the VREF threshold, the high-side switch is turned off.  When it returns below 107% of the VREF, the switch is  released again.    Thermal Shutdown (TSD)  If the junction temperature (TJ) exceeds +170℃, the  TSD protection circuit will stop switching to protect the  device from overheating. The device will automatically  restart with a power up sequence when the junction  temperature drops below +150℃.

Higher frequency  increases the switching and gate charge losses and  lower frequency requires larger inductance and  capacitances and results in larger overall physical size  and higher cost. Therefore, a tradeoff is needed  between losses and component size. If the application  is noise-sensitive to a frequency range, the frequency  should be selected out of that range.  For this design, a lower switching frequency of 500kHz  is chosen and a 49.9kΩ resistor can be chosen for R3  according to Equation 3.             SGM61630  60V, 3A Buck Converter with 50μA IQ      16  DECEMBER 2023    SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued) Input Capacitor Design  A high-quality ceramic capacitor (X5R or X7R or better  dielectric grade) must be used for input decoupling of  the SGM61630. At least 3μF of effective capacitance  (after derating) is needed on the VIN input. In some  applications additional bulk capacitance may also be  required for the VIN input, for example, when the  SGM61630 is more than 5cm away from the input  source. The VIN capacitor ripple current rating must also  be greater than the maximum input current ripple. The  input current ripple can be calculated using Equation 5  and the maximum value occurs at 50% duty cycle.  Using the design example values, IOUT = 3A, yields an  RMS input ripple current of 1.5A.

So, two 4.7µF/100V capacitors in parallel are  selected for VIN to cover all DC bias, thermal and aging  deratings. The input capacitance determines the  regulator input voltage ripple. This ripple can be  calculated from Equation 6. In this example, the total  effective capacitance of the two 4.7µF/100V capacitors  is around 8µF at 12V input, and the input voltage ripple  is 200mV.

Inductor Design  Equation 7 is conventionally used to calculate the  output inductance of a Buck converter. Generally, a  smaller inductor is preferred to allow larger bandwidth  and smaller size. The ratio of inductor current ripple (∆IL)  to the maximum output current (IOUT) is represented as  KIND factor (∆IL/IOUT). The inductor ripple current is  bypassed and filtered by the output capacitor and the  inductor DC current is passed to the output. Inductor  ripple is selected based on a few considerations. The  peak inductor current (IOUT + ∆IL/2) must have a safe  margin from the saturation current of the inductor in the  worst-case conditions especially if a hard-saturation  core type inductor (such as ferrite) is chosen. For peak  current mode converter, selecting an inductor with  saturation current above the switch current limit is  sufficient. The ripple current also affects the selection of  the output capacitor. COUT RMS current rating must be  higher than the inductor RMS ripple. Typically, a 20% to  40% ripple is selected (KIND = 0.2 ~ 0.4). Choosing a  higher KIND value reduces the selected inductance, but  a too high KIND factor may result in insufficient slope  compensation.  IN OUT OUT OUT IND IN SW V - V V L I K V f = × × ×             (7)  In this example, the calculated inductance will be  10.18μH with KIND = 0.3, so the nearest larger  inductance of 10μH is selected. The ripple, RMS and  peak inductors current calculations are summarized in  Equations 8, 9 and 10 respectively.

Therefore, it is always safer to  choose the inductor saturation current higher than the  current limit.           SGM61630  60V, 3A Buck Converter with 50μA IQ      17  DECEMBER 2023    SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued) External Diode  An external power diode between the SW and GND  pins is needed for the SGM61630 to complete the  converter. This diode must tolerate the application’s  absolute maximum ratings. The reverse blocking  voltage must be higher than VIN_MAX and its peak  current must be above the maximum inductor current.  Choose a diode with small forward voltage drop for  higher efficiency. Typically, diodes with higher voltage  and current ratings have higher forward voltages. A  diode with a minimum of 60V reverse voltage is  preferred to allow input voltage transients up to the  rated voltage of the SGM61630.    Output Capacitor  Three primary criteria must be considered for design of  the output capacitor (COUT):   1. The converter pole location.  2. The output voltage ripple.  3. The transient response to a large change in load  current.  The selected output capacitor value must satisfy all of  them. The desired transient response is usually  expressed  as  maximum  overshoot,  maximum  undershoot, or maximum recovery time of VOUT in  response to a large load step. Transient response is  usually the more stringent criteria in low output voltage  applications. The output capacitor must provide the  increased load current or absorb the excess inductor  current (when the load current steps down) until the  control loop can re-adjust the current of the inductor to  the new load level. Typically, it requires two or more  cycles for the loop to detect the output change and  respond (change the duty cycle). Another requirement  may also be expressed as desired hold-up time in  which the output capacitor must hold the output voltage  above a certain level for a specified period if the input  power is removed. It may also be expressed as the  maximum output voltage drop or rise when the full load  is connected or disconnected (100% load step).  Equation 11 can be used to calculate the minimum  output capacitance that is needed to supply a current  step (ΔIOUT) for at least 2 cycles until the control loop  responds to the load change with a maximum allowed  output transient of ΔVOUT (overshoot or undershoot).  × > × OUT OUT SW OUT 2 ΔI C f ΔV               (11)  where:  ΔIOUT is the change in output current.  ΔVOUT is the allowable change in the output voltage.  For example, if the acceptable transient from 1.5A to 3A  load step is 5%, by inserting ΔVOUT = 0.05 × 5V = 0.25V  and ΔIOUT = 1.5A, the minimum required capacitance  will be 24μF. Note that the impact of output capacitor  ESR on the transient is not considered in Equation 11.  For ceramic capacitors, the ESR is generally small  enough to ignore its impact on the calculation of ΔVOUT  transient. However, for aluminum electrolytic and  tantalum capacitors, or high current power supplies, the  ESR contribution to ΔVOUT must be considered.  When the load steps down, the excess inductor current  will charge the capacitor and the output voltage will  overshoot. The catch diode current cannot discharge  COUT, so COUT must be large enough as given in  Equation 12 to absorb the excess inductor energy with  limited over-voltage. The excess energy absorbed in  the output capacitor increases the voltage on the  capacitor. The capacitor must be sized to maintain the  desired output voltage during these transient periods.  Equation 12 calculates the minimum capacitance  required to keep the output-voltage overshoot to a  desired value.  > × + − 2 2 OUT _H OUT _L OUT 2 2 OUT OUT OUT I −I C L (V Δ V ) V        (12)  where:  IOUT_H is the high level of the current step.

Equation 13 can be used for the output ripple criteria  and finding the minimum output capacitance needed.   VOUT_RIPPLE is the maximum acceptable ripple.

UVLO Setting  The VIN UVLO can be programmed using an external  voltage divider on the EN pin of the SGM61630. In this  design R1 is connected between the VIN and EN pins  and R2 is connected between EN and GND (see Figure  6). The UVLO has two thresholds (Hysteresis), one for  power-up (turn-on) when the input voltage is rising and  one for power-down (turn-off) when the voltage is falling.  In this design, the turn-on (enable to start switching)  occurs when VIN rises above 7V (UVLO rising  threshold). When the regulator is working, it will not  stop switching (disabled) until the input voltage falls  below 5.5V (UVLO falling threshold). Equations 1 and 2  are provided to calculate the resistors. For this example,  the nearest standard resistor values are R1 = 320kΩ  and R2 = 61.2kΩ.

SGM61630  60V, 3A Buck Converter with 50μA IQ      19  DECEMBER 2023    SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued) Layout Considerations  PCB is an essential element of any switching power  supply. The converter operation can be significantly  disturbed due to the existence of the large and fast  raising/falling voltages that can couple through stray  capacitances to other signal paths, unless those  interferences are minimized and properly managed in  the layout design. Insufficient conductance in copper  traces for the high current paths results in high resistive  losses in the power paths and voltage errors. Following  the guidelines provided here are necessary to design a  good layout:   Bypass VIN pin to GND pin with low-ESR ceramic  capacitors (X5R or X7R or better dielectric) placed  as close as possible to VIN pin and the catch  diode anode pin.   Minimize the area and path length of the loop  formed by VIN pin, bypass capacitors connections,  SW pin and the catch diode.   Connect the device GND pin directly to the thermal  pad copper area under the IC device.   Stitch the thermal pad to the internal ground  planes and the back side of the PCB directly under  the IC using multiple thermal vias.   Use a short and wide path for routing the SW pin  to the cathode of the catch diode on the same  layer and to the output inductor.   Keep the SW area minimal and away from  sensitive signals like FB input and divider resistors  or RT/SYNC to avoid capacitive noise coupling.   Top side GND plane that is connected to the  thermal pad provides the best heat removal path  for the IC. It should be large enough for designs  that operate with full rated loads. Thicker copper  planes can improve heat dissipation.   Place the RT resistor (R3) as close as possible to  the RT/SYNC pin with short routes.
