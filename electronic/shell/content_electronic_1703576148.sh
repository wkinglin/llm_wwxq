The isolation  switch  provides  true  load  disconnection  when  SGM6604 is in shutdown mode. The SGM6604 is  capable to start up from 1.85V input, which is suitable  for single-cell Li-Ion battery or two-cell alkaline batteries  in series. The device can provide up to 20V output  voltage which makes it an excellent choice for  PMOLED panel bias and applications requiring high  voltage in a small solution size.  The SGM6604 has an internal fixed 12V output voltage  setting by connecting the FB pin to the VIN pin. Thus, it  only needs three external components to achieve 12V  output voltage. The SGM6604 has 1.12A typical switch  current limit and 6ms built-in soft-start time to minimize  the inrush current. When the SGM6604 is disabled via  EN pin, the isolation switch disconnects the output from  input to minimize the leakage current. The SGM6604  also implements various protection features such as  output short-circuit protection, output over-voltage  protection and thermal shutdown.

It is capable of providing up to  20V output. The SGM6604 features the PWM and  power-save mode (PSM). Under moderate to heavy  load condition, the SGM6604 works in PWM mode with  1.3MHz quasi-constant frequency. In light load  condition, the SGM6604 operates in the auto PSM to  improve the efficiency. Excellent line and load transient  responses can be achieved with minimal output  capacitance by applying a peak current control  topology.  Under-Voltage Lockout (UVLO)   An under-voltage lockout circuit prevents operation at  input voltages below 1.43V (TYP) with a hysteresis of  150mV. Therefore, if the input voltage rises and  exceeds 1.58V (TYP), the device restarts.   Enable and Shutdown   The SGM6604 implements the EN function to turn  on/off the device. A logic signal higher than 1.2V turns  on the device, and a logic signal lower than 0.3V turns  off the device and enters shutdown mode. Never leave  the EN pin floating.  Soft-Start   The built-in soft-start function is adopted to limit the  inrush current. When the input voltage is lower than  4.5V, VOUT starts up with a 150mA soft-start current  limit. If the input voltage exceeds 4.5V, soft-start  current limit is further decreased from 150mA to 100mA.  Once VOUT ramps up to 80% of the programmed  voltage,  the  full  current  limit  becomes  active  immediately (1.12A, TYP). This feature effectively  reduces the inrush current during start-up.  Peak Current Limit  The peak current mode control of SGM6604 provides  inherent over-current protection. The low-side FET is  turned off when the peak current reaches the current  limit threshold of 1.12A (TYP), and the low-side FET is  not turned on again until the next clock cycle. This  function protects it from being damaged by overload.  Short-Circuit Protection (SCP)  The built-in under-clocking function is adopted to  protect the device well. When the output voltage is  lower than 25% of the programmed voltage, it is  considered  as  short-circuit,  then  the  switching  frequency decreases to 200kHz. During start-up period,  the frequency fold-back operation is also implemented  before the output voltage reaches above 25% of the  programmed voltage. This feature efficiently reduces  the heat as starting up into short-circuit of output and  makes the device more safe.  Device Functional Modes   The synchronous Boost converter SGM6604 operates  at PWM mode with a constant frequency in moderate to  heavy load condition. The low-side N-MOSFET switch  is turned on at the start of a cycle, and the inductor  current increases to a peak current determined by the  error amplifier (EA). After the peak current is reached,  the current comparator trips, and it disables the  low-side N-MOSFET switch and the inductor current  goes through the body diode of the high-side  P-MOSFET in a dead-time duration. After the  dead-time duration, the high-side P-MOSFET switch is  turned on. As the output voltage is larger than the input  voltage, the inductor current decreases. After a short  dead-time duration, the low-side switch is turned on  again and the switching cycle is repeated. To avoid  sub-harmonic oscillation, the SGM6604 implements  internal slope compensation.   The device features a power-save mode (PSM) in light  load condition. The peak current will decrease as the  output load reduces until it is clamped to a set minimum  value. After that, if the output load is further reduced,  the device starts to operate in power-save mode.  Load Disconnect  The high-side switch can isolate the output from the  input under shutdown, which minimizes the leakage  current.  Over-Voltage Protection (OVP)   The SGM6604 provides 21.5V (TYP) OVP threshold.  The device stops switching immediately until the  voltage at the VOUT pin drops 2.5V below the output  OVP threshold. The OVP circuitry monitors the output  voltage (VOUT) and protects VOUT and SW from  exceeding safe operating voltages.   Thermal Shutdown   To prevent thermal damage, the device has an internal  temperature monitor. If the die temperature exceeds  155℃ (TYP), the device stops switching. Once the  temperature drops below 130℃ (TYP), the device  resumes operation.  20V Output Voltage  SGM6604  Synchronous Boost Converter      10  DECEMBER 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  "}'

One is the fixed 12V output voltage. Another  is the programmable output voltage. When the FB pin is  connected to the input voltage, the output voltage is set  for fixed 12V. This feature eliminates the divider  resistors, which minimizes the overall solution PCB size  as small as possible and also reduces the BOM cost.

Programmable Output Voltage Application Circuit    Inductor Selection  The inductor selection makes trade-offs among the size,  cost, efficiency, transient response and loop stability  requirements. Generally, key inductor parameters are  specified for operation with the device: inductance  value (L), rated current (IRATE), saturation current (ISAT),  and DC resistance (DCR).  In a Boost regulator, the inductor DC current IL(DC) can  be calculated with Equation 2.  OUT OUT L(DC) IN V I I V η × = ×                 (2)  where VOUT is output voltage, IOUT is output current, VIN  is input voltage, and η is the power conversion  efficiency (85% for most applications). The rated  current (IRATE) of selected inductor should be bigger  than the calculated IL(DC). If the device is applied in  higher temperature field, for example above +75℃, it is  recommended that IRATE of selected inductor usually  has 25% margin over the needed IL(DC).         20V Output Voltage  SGM6604  Synchronous Boost Converter      11  DECEMBER 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued)  Equation 3 shows the calculation of inductance  selection. For general rule of thumb, a good  compromise between size and loss is around 30%  peak-to-peak ripple current ΔIL(P-P) to the IC rated  current at nominal output voltage.  IN OUT IN L(P P) SW OUT V (V V ) L I f V − × − = ∆ × ×            (3)  where fSW is the switching frequency, ΔIL(P-P) is the  inductor ripple current, VIN is input voltage and VOUT is  output voltage.  The SGM6604 is designed to support inductor values  between 4.7μH and 10μH. Larger inductance values  result in lower output ripple voltage and higher  efficiency, but a slightly degraded transient response.  Lower inductance values allow for smaller case size,  but the larger ripple current increases the AC losses in  the inductor. The loop compensation of SGM6604 is  optimized with 10μH inductance. Therefore, the optimal  inductance value for SGM6604 is 10µH.   The inductor value determines not only the ripple  current but also the load current of boundary between  DCM and CCM.  For the given inductance value (L), the peak-to-peak  ripple current ΔIL(P-P) is calculated with Equation 4.  − × − ∆ = × × IN OUT IN L(P P) SW OUT V (V V ) I L f V          (4)  Therefore, the inductor peak current IL(Peak) is calculated  with Equation 5.  − ∆ = + L(P P) L(Peak) L(∆C) I I I 2             (5)  The selected inductor should have a saturation current  rating higher than the 1.12A (TYP) current limit of the  device.   To enhance the efficiency, choose a low-loss inductor  with the lowest possible DC resistance that fits in the  allotted dimensions.    Table 2.

A 4.7µF  ceramic capacitor is recommended to place as close as  possible between the VCC pin and GND pin of  SGM6604.     Output Capacitor Selection  The output capacitor is mainly selected according to  the output ripple required by the specification. The  output ripple composes of two parts which are caused  by equivalent series resistance (ESR) and capacitor’s  capacitance.  Assuming a ceramic capacitor with zero ESR (ESR is  usually very small and can be neglected), Equation 6  can be used to calculate and estimate the minimum  capacitance needed for a given ripple. This is because  the output capacitor supplies the entire output load  current during the power stage on-state.  × = × ∆ OUT MAX OUT SW RIPPLE I ∆ C f V               (6)  where DMAX is the maximum duty cycle, and ΔVRIPPLE is  the maximum allowed peak-to-peak ripple.  The ESR impacts on the output ripple and the transient  response must be considered if tantalum or aluminum  electrolytic capacitors are used.  The SGM6604 is an internally compensated device.  The output capacitor will affect the loop stability. The  recommended output ceramic capacitor with effective  capacitance is in the range of 0.47µF to 10µF at an  output voltage above 9V, where loop response is  optimized. When the output capacitance falls below the  range, the device may become unstable. Thus, please  be careful to consider the DC bias nature of ceramic  capacitors when choosing the capacitance value, rated  voltage and case size. Need to verify capacitor  manufacture’s datasheet to ensure enough effective  capacitance at desired output voltage.  20V Output Voltage  SGM6604  Synchronous Boost Converter      12  DECEMBER 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued)  Power Supply Recommendations  The SGM6604 can operate over an input voltage range  of 1.85V to 5V. Usually, the input power supply is very  stable and located close to the converter. A 4.7μF  ceramic bypass capacitor is enough. For some special  applications where the input source is more than a few  inches far away, an additional electrolytic or tantalum  capacitor more than 47µF may be needed. The input  power supply’s output current needs to comply with the  supply voltage, output voltage and output current of the  SGM6604.    Layout Guidelines  In addition to component selection, layout is a critical  step to ensure the performance. Poor layout could  result in system instability, noise and EMI problems,  even device damage. Thus, place the inductor, input  and output capacitors as close to the IC as possible,  and use wide and short traces for current carrying  traces to minimize PCB inductance. The length and  area of all traces connected to the SW pin should be  minimized.  For Boost converter, the output capacitor’s current loop   from VOUT pin back to the GND pin of the device is  also particularly critical, which should be as small as  possible.  Layout Example  A large ground plane on the bottom layer connects the  ground pins of the components on the top layer through  vias.        Figure 5.
