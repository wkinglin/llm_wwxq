The device features low insertion loss and high  isolation, which make it suitable for high linearity  receiving applications. It also has the advantage of high  linearity performance. The SGM11108M is not subject  to cellular interference and is applied to multi-mode and  multi-band LTE mobile phones.  The SGM11108M has the ability to integrate SP8T RF  switch and MIPI controller on silicon-on-insulator (SOI)  process. Internal driver and decoder for switch control  signals are offered by the controller, which makes it  flexible in RF path band and routing selection.  No external DC blocking capacitors required on the RF  paths as long as no external DC voltage is applied,  which can save PCB area and cost.  The SGM11108M is available in a Green UTQFN-2× 2-14AL package.    "}'

Functional operation of the device at any  conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended  Operating Conditions section is not implied.    ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION  This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are  not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all  integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions.  Failure  to  observe  proper  handling  and  installation  procedures can cause damage. ESD damage can range from  subtle performance degradation to complete device failure.  Precision integrated circuits may be more susceptible to  damage because even small parametric changes could  cause the device not to meet the published specifications.
