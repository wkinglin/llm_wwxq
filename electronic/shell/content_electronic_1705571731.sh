The  SGM2549D continuously monitors poles’ states and  makes right path selection for the ground pole and the  MIC pole. If no pole stays high long enough, the  SGM2549D will stop switching.  The SGM2549D works at both driver (the phone side)  and the peripheral side (the earphone side) with no  external devices needed, as showed in Figure 1.  Diagrams showed in Figure 2 to Figure 4 are  application circuits for making an earphone antenna, for  strengthening ESD protection, and etc.  The SGM2549D could be powered by a power rail or by  an external rectifier, as the Figure 3 or Figure 4 shows.    Making an Earphone Cable a Wipe Antenna  As showed in Figure 2, the LC networks composed of  L2, C2 and C3 is essential for matching receiver input  impedance, which is normally 50Ω and the impedance  of a wipe antenna, 110Ω normally. The inductor L1 is to  isolate the FM receiver ground from the ground of audio  driver and ground plane of the whole circuit, which  could be shorted if the ground of FM receiver is  properly placed. The 6 units of 33pF caps provide  current reflection terminations of rest wires in the  earphone cable and make them a single string wipe  antenna.    Strengthening ESD Protection  With its ESD cells on each GM1 pin and GM2 pin, and  isolation effect of those ferrite beads, most of those  transient voltage suppression diodes (TVS) showed in  Figure 2 may not be necessary, except the one to  protect the FM receiver input. However, those bond to  socket contact always help in strengthening ESD  protection.    Parasitic Power and MIC Bias  As in Figure 3 and Figure 4, the SGM2549D is possibly  powered by MIC bias, or audio signal from driver when  it is used in peripheral side.  The C1 stores power extracted from the MIC bias input  or the driving waves of the R channel or L channel. The  C1 could be eliminated if a true microphone is used at  peripheral, as the microphone output only swings in  several tens mV, which does not affect the circuitry  much.     Crosstalk and Side-Tone Suppression  Figure 7 illustrates how the ground path inserts  crosstalk between L and R channels and side-tone into  the output of a microphone inherently. If the current in L  channel speaker creates a voltage drop on the RON,  then the R channel sees the drop as crosstalk. The  sum of drops created by both L and R channels makes  the ground reference to microphone, and then it adds  into SMIC and causes the side-tone.  RON L Driving R Driving SMIC GND Microphone Speakers VDROP SGM2549D SPHR   Figure 7. The Ground Path Impedance Drop    The conventional Howland is designed to correct the  VDROP that is sensed at the PHR of the SGM2549D,  here the recommended method is to sense the SPHR at  the PHR pin and correct it digitally.           CTIA/OMTP Headset Ground Pole Switch  SGM2549D  Autonomous Pole Position Fixing      9  DECEMBER 2018    SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION AND APPLICATIONS (continued)  An Evaluation Board  There are 2 sockets for connecting once to one kind of  source with a 2-heads cable, 1 socket for connecting a  headset or another 2-heads cable on the EVB170304  evaluation board, where the J1 is for connecting a CTIA  source, the J2 for an OMTP source, and J3 for a  headset or for a source. The EVB170304 is designed to  demonstrate following cases:  1. Use VCC input at the J1 and R1 to simulate a  microphone biasing, to demonstrate the ground pole  fixing. Headsets or earphones without any microphone  are plugged in the J3. Fixing is observed by checking  voltages at the TP5 and the TP6. The voltage at the  TP5 is high for a CTIA type headset, high at the TP6 is  for an OMTP type headset. None of them high is for an  earphone without any microphone.  2. Connect one of CTIA type or OMTP type source at  the J1 or the J2 correspondingly through a 2-heads  cable, with or without a VCC power input at the I1 and  the I2, to demonstrate the fixing by plugging in different  types of headsets in the J3. Keep the JP2 open for this  demonstration; close the JP1 if not using a VCC input.  3. Connect to any of the CTIA type or the OMTP type  source at the J3 through a 2-heads cable, to  demonstrate a headset or a circuit in headset side to  plug in any source type, with a VCC input at I1 and I2,  or parasitically powered by microphone biasing. Keep  the JP1 and the JP2 open for this demonstration.  4. Input a square wave at the R channel from a CTIA or  an OMTP source at the J3 through a 2-heads cable, to  demonstrate how power is extracted from it. Keep the  JP1 open, the JP2 close for this demonstration.
