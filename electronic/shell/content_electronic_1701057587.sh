The device can work at common mode voltages from  -24V to 105V. There are four different gains for  SGM8197xQ series: 10V/V, 20V/V, 50V/V and 100V/V,  and the bandwidth reaches 1200kHz for gain = 20V/V.  An open-drain comparator with a 0.6V voltage reference  (inverting input) is integrated. The current trip point can  be set with the external voltage at CMPIN pin. The  comparator output can be transparent or latched,  depending on whether the RESET തതതതതതതതതത pin is pulled high or  left floating (or grounded). The operating supply voltage  of SGM8197xQ series is from 2.7V to 28V, with a  typical supply current of 550μA. All versions are  specified within -40℃ to +125℃.    The Selection of RSHUNT  The application of SGM8197xQ series will determine  the selection of the shunt resistor RSHUNT. Also, the users  should consider the trade-off between voltage loss and  the accuracy of small input signals. The effect of offset  can be minimized by using high values of RSHUNT, while  the voltage loss can be minimized by using low values  of RSHUNT. For most applications, a voltage drop of  50mV to 100mV over RSHUNT is the appropriate range for  the selection of RSHUNT.    Comparator  The SGM8197xQ series integrates an open-drain  comparator with a 0.3μs (TYP) response time. The  RESET തതതതതതതതതത pin can be used to latch and reset the  comparator output. The output is latched at the high  level only, see Figure 4.  Figure 5 shows the SGM8197xQ in use as a high  voltage load switch which has a high precision  current-sense function and the open-drain output of the  comparator is used to drive external high voltage  MOSFET.

Filtering at the input pins would be a good choice as  long as the change of the input impedance is taken in  account. The corresponding filtering circuit is shown in  Figure 6. The shift in the initial gain and the effects on  the gain tolerance can be minimized by choosing a low  resistor value. Equation 1 shows the effect of the initial  gain.  ( ) FILTER 5kΩ Gain Error %  = 100 - 100   5kΩ + R   ×         (1)   Replacing the 5kΩ term with 5kΩ - 30% or 5kΩ + 30%  is a way to calculate influence of the gain error. The  selection of RFILTER should be substituted into the Equation  1. For example, the calculated error of gain is 1.96% if  the customers replace the two 100Ω 1% resistors at the  position of RFILTER (shown in Figure 6). However, the  worst case is that the internal input impedance is 5kΩ -  30% and the offset of RFILTER is 3%. Under this worst  situation, the error of gain would be larger than normal  after calculation.   These tolerance should always be taken into  consideration for the specified accuracy of the  SGM8197xQ series. To calculate the variations of  accuracy, it is recommended to use calculations of the  root sum square or the geometric mean to evaluate the  influence of the filtering resistor RFILTER.

In the application, VCM is nearly  equal to VIN+ as the voltage between the two edges of  the current-shunt resistor (VSENSE) is small and can be  neglected.  The following 6 cases show the extent of accuracy for  SGM8197xQ series.  • Normal Case 1: VCM ≥ VS, VSENSE ≥ 20mV.  • Normal Case 2: VCM < VS, VSENSE ≥ 20mV.  • Low VSENSE Case 1: -24V ≤ VCM < GND, VSENSE < 20mV.  • Low VSENSE Case 2: GND ≤ VCM ≤ VS, VSENSE < 20mV.  • Low VSENSE Case 3: VS < VCM ≤ 105V, VSENSE < 20mV.     Normal Case 1: VCM ≥ VS, VSENSE ≥ 20mV   The SGM8197xQ series has the greatest accuracy in  this range. To explain, the input offset voltage can be  measured with two steps.  First, the following equation can be used to calculate  the gain of current-sense monitor:  OUT1 OUT2 V  - V G = 100mV - 20mV             (2)  where:  • VOUT1 illustrates the output when VSENSE = 100mV.  • VOUT2 illustrates the output when VSENSE = 20mV.  After calculating the corresponding gain of the  current-sense monitor, the following equation can also  be used to calculate VOS.   ( )       OUT1 OS V V RTI Referred to Input  =   - 100mV G   (3)    Normal Case 2: VCM < VS, VSENSE ≥ 20mV   Operation in this common mode voltage range is  slightly less accurate than Normal Case 1.    Low VSENSE Case 1: -24V ≤ VCM < GND, VSENSE < 20mV,  and Low VSENSE Case 3: VS < VCM ≤ 105V, VSENSE < 20mV   The SGM8197xQ series will operate accurately in  these regions, if the sense voltage approaches 20mV.  For lower sense voltages, the offset voltage will  dominate the total output error and the accuracy will be  reduced. Figure 7 shows this characteristics by using  the SGM8197A3Q (100V/V).      Figure 7. VOUT vs. VSENSE for Low VSENSE Cases 1 and 3  (SGM8197A3Q, Gain = 100)    Low VSENSE Case 2: GND ≤ VCM ≤ VS, VSENSE < 20mV   For SGM8197xQ series, the operation accuracy of the  current-sense monitor is the lowest. The current  monitor uses two operational amplifers in parallel for  handling the the wide range of VCM. One amplifier is  used to handle the positive VCM while the other is used  to handle negative VCM. However, in this case, both of  the two amplifiers do not take a leading position which  can result in low loop gain. In this region, if the voltage  of VSENSE approaches to 0V, the output of SGM8197xQ  series may be fixed at a stable value, which means that  it is unchangeable with the increasing or decreasing of  the VSENSE. However, if the voltage drop of VSENSE  approaches to 20mV, the output voltage is much closer  to the actual value of VOUT.      0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0 0 4 8 12 16 20 VOUT (V)  VSENSE (mV)  — Actual  — Ideal      Automotive, High-Side Current-Sense Amplifier  SGM8197xQ  with Open-Drain Comparator and Reference      18  NOVEMBER 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued)  Transient Protection  The common mode voltage range of the SGM8197xQ  series (-24V to 105V) is suitable for withstanding  automotive fault conditions in the range between -24V  and 105V, since there is no need for additional  protective components to guarantee that the device can  work at this level. If the operating condition of  SGM8197xQ series is required to operate in the  transients which are beyond this rating, an external  transient absorber (such as a Zener) should be used. A  semiconductor absorber of transient can be used to  protect the device from this fault conditions. However,  any MOVs or VDRs should not be taken into  consideration for the protection. The transient absorber  should be selected which guarantees that the exposure  voltage transient for SGM8197xQ is less than 105V.  Although Zener-type ESD can be used to protect the  device from any fault transient of voltage, the external  resistors RFILTER can not be used in series at the input  pins of SGM8197xQ series as the internal gain  resistors can reach ±30% of the typical values, which  may cause the gain error of the current-sense monitor.    Range of Output Voltage  The maximum output voltage is limited by the supply  voltage (VS). For example, a 100mV full-scale input can  be amplified to the output voltage of 10V by the  current-sense amplifier SGM8197A3Q, so 10V power  supply voltage is appropriate to achieve 10V output.

For  example, the VS power supply can be 10V and the load  or common mode power supply voltage is allowed to  reach up to 105V. The output voltage range is limited by  the level of the power supply.  The decoupling capacitor of the power supply pin must  be close to the VS and GND pins. 0.1μF to 0.47μF  decoupling capacitor is recommended, but for noisy or  high-impedance power supplies, additional decoupling  capacitance need to be added.    Layout  Kelvin or 4-wire connection technique should be used  to connect between the input pins of SGM8197xQ and  the sensing resistor. And this kind of connection can  guarantee that the resistance detected is the sensing  resistor RSHUNT only.
