It needs an external  voltage reference. An Amplifier can be used between MXO  and AINP for signal conditioning. Figure 1 and Figure 2  show the chip operating time sequences.   The SGM5200 output data is composed of 4-bit channel  address and 12-bit ADC conversion result. To read and  write GPIOs, more details refer to Table 1, Table 2 and  Table 5.  The SGM5200 switches to new multiplexer channel on the  2nd falling edge of SCLK. The input acquisition phase (equal  input capacitor starts charging) begins on the 14th falling  edge of SCLK. The input signal is sampled on the nCS  falling edge.  The TSSOP package of the SGM5200 has four  general-purpose IO (GPIO) pins, and the TQFN package  has one GPIO pin.  The chip refreshes the GPIO status (Input and output) at  the nCS falling edge. The GPI data will be in the same  frame starting with the nCS falling edge (if GPI read  enabled).  The operating time sequence is shown in Figure 2, the  falling edge of nCS clocks out DO15, the remain bits are  shifted out on the falling edge of SCLK. The ADC result is a  12-bit binary data, MSB is shifted out on the 4th falling edge  of SCLK, and LSB is shifted out on the 15th falling edge of  SCLK. Refer to Figure 2, when the ADC conversion ends  on the 16th SCLK falling edge, SDO goes to 3-state. The  chip 16-bit data (on SDI pin) is shifted in on the every rising  edge of SCLK.  The SGM5200 has threshold alarm function per channel. If  ADC results exceed these limits (high and low), the chip  can give alert on GPIO0/GPIO1 pins (detail configurations  in Table 9). If there is an alarm, the alert will be set on the  12th SCLK falling edge in the same frame of ADC  conversion in progress. It will reset on the 10th SCLK falling  edge in the next frame.    Reference  The SGM5200 needs an external reference.    Power Saving  The SGM5200 provides two kinds of ways to power down  the chip. The first way is command control. It depends on  setting DI5 = '1', more details see Table 1, Table 2 and  Table 5. If DI5 is set, the chip will be powered down on the  16th falling edge of SCLK in the next frame. If D15 is reset,  the chip will be powered up on the nCS falling edge. The  second way is asynchronous control by GPIO3. GPIO3 can  be configured as an nPD input (see Table 9). Its output is  active low. The chip goes to power-down at same time  when nPD is '0'. The chip will be powered up when nPD is  '1'.    Device Functional Modes  Channel Sequencing Modes  The SGM5200 has three channel sequencing modes:  manual mode, auto-1 mode and auto-2 mode. Mode  selection is configured by the mode control register (see  Table 1, Table 2 and Table 5). The new channel selection is  valid on the 2nd SCLK falling edge in the next frame in all  three modes (refer to Figure 1).  Once the chip is configured to working in a selected mode,  it keeps working in this mode until the chip is powered down,  reset or reprogrammed. Allows it to exit multiple times and  re-enter this mode without disturbing program register  settings.    Manual Mode  When power-up or after reset the default channel is  'channel 0' and the default mode is manual mode.    Auto-1 Mode  In auto-1 mode, the chip scans all selected channels in  ascending order. The selected channels are configured in a  program register. The auto-1 program register setting is  shown in Table 3 and Table 4. The auto-1 program register  is reset to '0hFFFF'.    Auto-2 Mode  In auto-2 mode, the chip scans all selected channels from  channel 0 to the last channel. The last channel is configured  in a program register. The auto-2 program register setting is  shown in Table 6. The auto-2 program register are reset to  '0hF'.    Device Programming and Mode Control  The chip has two kinds of registers named mode registers  and program registers.    Power-Up Sequence  After power-up, the chip is in default manual mode and  channel 0 is set as default channel. User needs to configure  program register and mode register to set the chip working  in target mode.   12-Bit, 1MSPS, 16 Channels,  SGM5200  Single-Ended, Serial Interface ADC      17    SEPTEMBER 2022  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued)  Operating in Manual Mode  The mode control register settings for manual mode are  shown in Table 1. In manual mode, no program register is  required.  The example for the chip how to work in manual mode and  scan channels CH3, CH5 and CH7 is shown in Figure 5. In  this sequence, in the frame N manual mode and channel  CH3 is selected. In the frame N+1, keep in manual mode  and channel CH5 is selected, internal MUX is switched to  channel CH3 on the 2nd falling edge of SCLK. In the frame  N+2, keep in manual mode and channel CH7 is selected,  on the falling edge of nCS, channel CH3 input signal is  sampling and conversion result is sent out in this frame,  internal MUX is switched to CH5. And the chip repeats this  sequence and sends out ADC conversion result data of  CH5 and CH7 in the following two frames.    Table 1.

There are both mode registers and  program registers for auto-1 mode operation.  To let the chip work in auto-1 mode, it is necessary to  configure auto-1 program register firstly to select which  channels are going to be scanned.  The program register settings for auto-1 mode are shown in  Table 3 and Table 4.  Before running in auto-1 mode, the target channels CH2,  CH3 and CH5 (examples) must be configured in auto-1  program registers (details see auto-1 program registers  configuration sequence).  The example for the chip how to work in auto-1 mode and  scan channels CH2, CH3 and CH5 automatically is shown  in Figure 6. In this sequence, in the frame N sent entering  auto-1 mode command and channel CH2 is selected  automatically (the chip find the first selected channel in  ascending order automatically). In the frame N+1, the chip  switches MUX to CH2. In the frame N+2, the chip samples  the CH2 input and gives out ADC conversion result, and the  MUX is switched to CH3 automatically. In the frame N+3,  the chip samples CH3 and gives out ADC conversion  results, and the MUX is switched to CH5 automatically, and  so on. This process repeats until the last selected channel  is reached, and the process loops back from the first  selected channel.   In any case, re-entering auto-1 mode (It may be from auto-1  mode, manual mode and auto-2 mode) will cause the chip  channel scan sequence restarts from the first selected  channel.  Note that changing the auto-1 program register during the  chip is working in auto-1 mode, the chip scan restarts from  the first selected channel in ascending.  Figure 7 shows how the auto-1 program registers is  configured. It is used to pre-select the channels for auto-1  scanning. It needs two operation frames for a complete  configuration.

The example about the chip how to work in auto-2 mode  and scan channels CH0, CH1 and CH2 automatically is  shown in Figure 8. In this sequence, in the frame N sent  entering auto-2 mode command and channel CH0 is  selected  automatically  (the  chip  switches  to  CH0  automatically). In the frame N+1, the chip switches MUX to  CH02. In the frame N+2, the chip samples the CH0 input  and gives out ADC conversion result, and the MUX is  switched to CH1 automatically. In the frame N+3, the chip  samples CH1 and gives out ADC conversion, and the MUX  is switched to CH2 automatically, and so on. This process  repeats until the last selected channel is reached (In this  example, the last channel is CH2), and the process loops  back from channel CH0.  In any case, re-entering auto-2 mode possibly from auto-1  mode, manual mode and auto-2 mode will cause the chip  channel scan sequence to restart from the channel CH0.  Note that changing the auto-2 program register during the  chip is working in auto-2 mode, the chip scan restarts from  channel CH0.    Figure 9 shows how the auto-2 program registers is  configured. It’s for pre-select the last channel for auto-2  scanning. It needs one operation frames for a complete  configuration. Refer to Table 6 for more setting details      Table 5.

The bits are valid for GPIOs that are not assigned a specific function by bits DI[8:4].    Alarm Thresholds for GPIO Pins  Each channel has separate high alarm threshold and low  alarm threshold. To configure chip quickly, the input  channels are divided into 4 groups, each group can be  programmed consecutively (8 registers are programmed in  one sequence).   In Table 10, the chip has its input channels divide into 4  groups.   Table 11 shows details of the alarm program register.  Each group needs 9 operation frames to complete the  alarm thresholds configuration. The chip supports quit the  configuration sequence in middle of progress (DI12 in alarm  program register is enabled, and < 8 registers is configured).  Once DI12 is enabled, the chip quits the configuration  sequence in the next frame.    Table 10.
