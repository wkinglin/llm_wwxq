High switching  frequency makes it easy to use small components and  optimized for portable photoflash. The SGM3785S is  ideal for high power flash LEDs which are suitable for  mobile phone camera modules and digital still cameras.  The SGM3785S offers excellent flexibility to enter flash  mode and movie/torch mode through the ENF and  ENM pins respectively. Flash mode is usually used with  670ms timer control to generate a high intensity flash.  The maximal flash current and movie/torch current are  respectively programmed through external resistors  (RSETF and RSETM), which can provide simple control for  the flash LED solution. The real LED current in flash  mode and movie/torch mode can be programmed by  external PWM signal on ENM pin.  The D1 and D2 pins can be tied together to drive higher  power single flash LEDs, sinking up to 1.5A continuous  current. The integrated thermal regulation in flash mode  limits the temperature of the device to prevent the  device from triggering thermal shutdown by reducing  the LED sink current below the programmed value.  The SGM3785S provides very low shutdown current. It  also includes a comprehensive set of protection  features such as over-voltage protection, LED open or  short protection and thermal shutdown.  The SGM3785S is available in a Green TDFN-3×2-14L  package. It operates over an ambient temperature  range of -40℃ to +85℃.  "}'

The integrated Boost DC/DC converter integrates two  power FETs with 2MHz switching frequency. Discrete  DC/DC converter regulates a fixed output voltage. In  contrast, the SGM3785S adaptively regulates the  output voltage based on the flash LED forward voltage  and current. This method effectively increases the  conversion efficiency by maintaining the minimal output  voltage for proper LED conduction. The Boost  converter regulates the output voltage based on the  LEDs with the highest forward voltage. For higher sink  current applications, two sinks channels could be  shorted together to achieve 1.5A sink capability.  The SGM3785S offers flexible control interface to  control the flash, movie/torch mode. After power-on,  SGM3785S stays in shutdown mode. One PWM signal  (5μs ≤ tH ≤ 5ms) at ENM pin programs the SGM3785S  to enter active mode, PWM signal will adjust the flash  LED current. Once ENF changed from “0” to “1”, it  enters into Flash mode. The output flashing LED  current is equal to ISETF × D. If SGM3785S is desired to  work in Movie/Torch mode, one long time logic “High”  pulse must be provided at ENM pin. The time of logic  “High” must be larger than 5ms. The falling edge of this  long time pulse will reset the LED current control, and  the LED current will be programmed by the PWM signal  following this long time pulse. The LED current in  Movie/Torch mode is ISETM × D.  Flash Mode LED Current  The SGM3785S matches the sink current on D1 and  D2 internally. The device supports maximal 1.5A flash  mode LED sink current on D1 and D2. An external  resistor connected on RSETF pin programs the maximum  flash mode current in each sink output. Use Equation 1  to calculate the flash mode sink current.   ISETF = 9000/RSETF              (1)  The real flashing current is dimmed by the PWM signal  at ENM pin, D is the Duty cycle of PWM signal:  IFLASH (D1) = IFLASH (D2) = ISETF × D        (2)  For SGM3785S, there is a 670ms hardware timer,  which will turn off the LED flashing current after this  time expires.  The SGM3785S implements automatic thermal control  when flash mode is programmed. When flash mode is  enabled, device temperature could rise quickly. The  thermal regulation loop will engage when the IC  temperature reaches 100℃. The two channel’s sink  current is automatically reduced. This implementation  effectively prevents the device from triggering thermal  shutdown, which causes LEDs to flicker. Due to this  thermal regulation loop, good thermal PCB layout is  necessary to ensure proper sink current in flash mode  current setting.  Movie/Torch Mode LED Current  The SGM3785S supports D1 and D2 LED current up to  400mA total in movie/torch mode. The output current  on each channel is matched internally as the flash  mode. An external resistor connected on RSETM pin  programs the maximum movie/torch mode current in  each sink output. Use Equation 3 to calculate the  movie/torch mode sink current.  ISETM = 6800/RSETM              (3)  The real LED current is dimmed by the PWM signal at  ENM pin, D is the Duty cycle of PWM signal:  IMOVIE (D1) = I MOVIE (D2) = ISETM × D      (4)  A Movie/Torch mode event is initiated by asserting a  long time logic “High” pulse at the ENM pin.  LED Open Protection  The SGM3785S implements LED open protection  when the D1 and D2 channels are shorted together. In  an open fault event, the device controls the loop to  clamp the VOUT at OVP threshold of 5.3V (TYP).  LED Short Protection  During operation, the SGM3785S implements a 5mA  (TYP) LED sensing current when D1 and D2 channels  are connected together to detect a short event. This  sensing current generates a voltage drop on each LED  to detect a short event. The SGM3785S compares the  VOUT pin and D1/D2 voltages. If the voltage difference  is less than a preset threshold, the IC detects this event  as a short, and the flash/movie mode sink current is  disabled. Care should be taken that some flash LEDs  have large leakage current up to hundreds of μA even it  is not fully turned on. The 5mA sensing current ensures  the proper LED operation and avoids triggering false  LED short event. If the short circuit condition is  removed, the SGM3785S automatically resumes  operation to the programmed current setting.         SGM3785S  2MHz, 1.5A Flash LED Driver      12  DECEMBER 2022  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued)  Single LED Application  Each sink channel of the SGM3785S is well matched  and regulated. For single LED applications, D1 and D2  pins can be shorted together to drive a single LED and  deliver up to 1.5A sink current, as shown in Figure 7.  Each current sink can be calculated by the equations  under Flash Mode LED Current and Movie/Torch Mode  LED Current sections.  Inductor Selection  The SGM3785S is optimized for 1.0μH to 2.2μH  inductor. The selected inductor should have enough  saturation current rating that is higher than the worst  case peak inductor current given by Equation 5.      (5)  where 0.8 is the estimated efficiency of 80%.  For 1.5A total current as an example, the peak inductor  current for a 1μH assuming 50% as the worst case duty  cycle, maximum LED forward voltage of 4V and  maximum load current of 1.5A is shown below:   PEAK(L) 4V 1.5A 3.5V 0.25 I 2.6A 0.8 3.5V 2 1 × × = + = × ×       (6)  For lower inductance, the inductor peak current will  increase. To ensure proper operation, the inductor peak  current should not exceed the valley PMOS current  limit and the inductor saturation current rating. Care  should be taken to ensure selected inductor does not  saturate at maximum LED sink current, minimum input  voltage and high ambient temperature.  Capacitor Selection  A 2.2μF low ESR ceramic capacitor is recommended  as the input capacitor to improve transient response  and EMI performance for high current flash LEDs.  Place the input capacitor as close to the input pin and  the PGND pin of the SGM3785S as possible.  The desired LED current determines the required  output capacitance. A 2.2μF or 4.7μF ceramic output  capacitor is recommended for most applications.

Poor layout can result in system instability,  EMI failure, and device damage. Thus, place the  inductor, input and output capacitors as close to the IC  as possible. Wide and short traces can be used to  minimize PCB inductance for current carrying traces.  For Boost converter, the output capacitor’s current loop  from VOUT pin back to the GND pin of the device should  be as small as possible. Figure 8 shows an example of  SGM3785S PCB layout.
