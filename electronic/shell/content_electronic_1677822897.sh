The output swing is rail-to-rail with heavy loads. The  SGM8262-2 is optimized for high voltage operation  from ±2.25V to ±18V dual supplies.    Power Supply and Decoupling  The supported voltage of the power supply for  SGM8262-2 is from ±2.25V to ±18V. Also, the customer  should ensure that the source of the power supply is  low noise and well-regulated. The power supply should  be decoupled suitably. The power supply ripple and  power dissipation can be decreased dramatically by  using low ESR capacitor. The multilayer ceramic  capacitors (MLCCs) are good choices for decoupling. A  0.1μF MLCC capacitor should be placed as close as  possible (0.125 inches) to the power supply pin of the  SGM8262-2. For decoupling the low-frequency signals,  10μF to 22μF tantalum capacitors should be taken into  account so that it can convey the current for large and  fast signal changes.    Layout  A good PCB layout is important for the performance of  SGM8262-2 in high speed applications in order to prevent  the parasitic effects from the board. The PCB should  have a low impedance loop (or ground) to the power  supply. Removing the GND planes for all of the layers  of the PCB board can simply reduce the stray  capacitors. Also, the PCB traces should be placed as  short as possible in order to reduce parasitic  inductance and capacitance. The resistors or loads  should be placed as close as possible to the terminals  of the SGM8262-2. The input traces of the SGM8262-2  should be placed away from the output trace to  minimize coupling (crosstalk).  If the SGM8262-2 is used for differential driver, the  customers should guarantee the symmetrical layout to  obtain better output performance. If the trace for the  differential signal is long, please make sure that place  the two differential traces as close as possible, or twist  them together in order to reduce the inductive loop. The  above method can enhance the anti-interference ability  for RF signal by reducing the radiated energy. It is  recommended to use strip line for the signal trace  which is longer than 1 inch.
