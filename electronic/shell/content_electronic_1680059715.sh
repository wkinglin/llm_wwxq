It is recommended to use an output capacitor with effective capacitance in the  range of 10μF to 1000μF to ensure stability. This ceramic capacitor should be placed as close as  possible to OUT pin.  2  SNS  Output Voltage Sense Input Pin. The SNS pin is connected to the load side of the output trace only  when the pin-selectable programming mode is used. Keep SNS pin floating if the VOUT voltage is set  by external resistor.  3  FB  Feedback Voltage Input Pin. Connect this pin to the midpoint of an external resistor divider to adjust  the output voltage. Place the resistors as close as possible to this pin.  4  PG  Power-Good Indicator Output Pin. An open-drain, active-high output that indicates the status of VOUT.  When the output voltage reaches VIT(PG) of the target, the PG pin goes into a high-impedance state.  5  50mV  Output Voltage Setting Pins. Select the desired output voltage by connecting these pins to the ground.  Connecting these pins to the ground increases the output voltage value corresponding to the pin  name. Multiple pins can be connected to GND at the same time. When VOUT is set by an external  resistor, leave these pins floating (open).  6  100mV  7  200mV  9  400mV  10  800mV  11  1.6V  12  BIAS  Bias Supply Voltage Pin for Internal Control Circuits.

Using an external capacitor CNR/SS to decouple this pin to GND  can not only reduce output noise to very low level but also slow down the VOUT rise like a soft-start  behavior.  14  EN  Enable Pin. Drive EN high to turn on the regulator. Drive EN low to turn off the regulator. This pin  must be connected to IN or BIAS pin if enable functionality is not used.  15, 16, 17  IN  Input Supply Voltage Pin. It is recommended to use a 10μF or larger ceramic capacitor from IN pin to  ground to get good power supply decoupling. This ceramic capacitor should be placed as close as  possible to IN pin.  8, 18  GND  Ground.  Exposed  Pad  GND  Exposed Pad. Connect it to GND internally.

These features make the device a  reliable solution to solve many challenging problems in  the generation of clean and accurate power supply. The  high performance also makes the SGM2050C useful in  a variety of applications. The SGM2050C provides the  protection functions for output overload, output short  -circuit condition and overheating.  The SGM2050C provides an EN pin as an external chip  enable control to enable/disable the device. When the  regulator is in shutdown state, the shutdown current  consumes as low as 1.4μA (TYP).    Input Capacitor Selection (CIN, CBIAS)  The input decoupling capacitor should be placed as  close as possible to the IN pin and BIAS pin to ensure  the device stability. CIN = 10μF/CBIAS = 5μF or larger  X7R or X5R ceramic capacitors are selected to get  good dynamic performance.  When VIN is required to provide large current  instantaneously, a large effective input capacitor is  required. Multiple input capacitors can limit the input  tracking inductance. Adding more input capacitors is  available to restrict the ringing and to keep it below the  device absolute maximum ratings.    Output Capacitor Selection (COUT)  The output capacitor should be placed as close as  possible to the OUT pin. 10μF or larger X7R or X5R  ceramic capacitor is selected to get good dynamic  performance. The minimum effective capacitance of  COUT that SGM2050C can remain stable is 10μF. For  ceramic capacitor, temperature, DC bias and package  size will change the effective capacitance, so enough  margin of COUT must be considered in design.  Additionally, COUT with larger capacitance and lower  ESR will help increase the high frequency PSRR and  improve the load transient response.    Noise-Reduction and Soft-Start Capacitor  Selection (CNR/SS)  The SGM2050C is designed for a programmable,  monotonic soft-start time of output rising, and it can be  achieved via an external capacitor (CNR/SS) on the  NR/SS pin. Using an external CNR/SS is recommended  for general application. It not only minimizes the inrush  current but also helps reduce the noise component  from internal reference.    Adjustable Output Voltage  The SGM2050C can be set either with the internal  pin-selectable network or by connecting with external  resistors to achieve different output voltages. When the  output voltage range is from 0.8V to 3.95V, the  SGM2050C can be programmed by using the pin-  selectable network. When the output voltage range is  greater than 3.95V and up to 5.2V, external resistors  must be used as shown in Figure 3. The output voltage  is determined by the following equation:    = × +       1 OUT 2 R V 0.8V 1   R             (1)  One parallel capacitor (CFF = 10nF) with R1 can be  used to improve the feedback loop stability and PSRR,  increase the transient response and reduce the output  noise. Use an R1 approximately 12kΩ to maintain a 5μA  minimum load.

Each pin can be grounded (active) or floating (open)  or connected to the SNS pin. Pin-selectable programming  is set as the internal reference voltage by Equation 2  plus the accumulated sum of the respective voltages  assigned to each active pin. Table 1 shows these  voltage values related to each active pin setting for  reference.  VOUT = 0.8V + (Σ Pin-Selectable Pins to Ground)  (2)  Table 1. Pin-Selectable Programmable Output Voltage  Pin-Selectable Program Pins  (Active Low)  Additive Output Voltage Level  Pin 5 (50mV)  50mV  Pin 6 (100mV)  100mV  Pin 7 (200mV)  200mV  Pin 9 (400mV)  400mV  Pin 10 (800mV)  800mV  Pin 11 (1.6V)  1.6V  The output voltage is set according to Equation 1 as for  the adjustable operation, but R1 and R2 are internally  integrated and matched for higher accuracy. By  reducing the value of R1 and connecting any of the  pin-selectable pins to the SNS pin, the resolution of the  internal feedback network can be improved.    Enable Control  The EN pin of the SGM2050C is used to enable/disable  the device and to deactivate/activate the output  automatic discharge function.  When the EN pin voltage is lower than VIL(EN), the  device is in shutdown state. There is no current flowing  from IN to OUT pins. In this state, the automatic  discharge transistor is active to discharge the output  voltage through a 260Ω (TYP) resistor.  When the EN pin voltage is higher than VIH(EN), the  device is in active state. The output voltage is regulated  to the expected value and the automatic discharge  transistor is turned off.    Reverse Current Protection  The pass transistor has an inherent body diode which  will be forward biased in the case when VOUT > (VIN +  0.3V). If extended reverse voltage operation is  anticipated, external limiting might be appropriate.    Negatively Biased Output  When the output voltage is negative, the chip may not  start up due to parasitic effects. Ensure that the output  is greater than -0.3V under all conditions. If negatively  biased output is excessive and expected in the  application, a Schottky diode can be added between  the OUT pin and GND pin.    Output Current Limit and Short-Circuit  Protection  When overload events happen, the output current is  internally limited to 4.1A (TYP). When the OUT pin is  shorted to ground, the short-circuit protection will limit  the output current to 2A (TYP).    Thermal Shutdown  The SGM2050C can detect the temperature of die.  When the die temperature exceeds the threshold value  of thermal shutdown, the SGM2050C will be in  shutdown state and it will remain in this state until the  die temperature decreases to +140℃.    Power Dissipation (PD)  Power dissipation (PD) of the SGM2050C can be  calculated by the equation PD = (VIN - VOUT) × IOUT.  Thermal shutdown protection starts when the power  dissipation of the device is too high and the operating  junction temperature exceeds +165℃.  The maximum allowable power dissipation (PD(MAX)) of  the SGM2050C is affected by many factors, including  the difference between junction temperature and  ambient temperature (TJ(MAX) - TA), package thermal  resistance from the junction to the ambient environment  (θJA), the rate of ambient airflow and PCB layout. PD(MAX)  can be approximated by the following equation:   PD(MAX) = (TJ(MAX) - TA)/θJA               (3)         3A, High Accuracy, Low Noise,  SGM2050C  Low Dropout Linear Regulator        13  MARCH 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  "}'
