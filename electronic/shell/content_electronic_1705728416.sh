Application areas include LiDAR, time  of flight, facial recognition, and power converters using  low-side drivers.  The SGM48521 provides 2.2ns propagation delay from  the driver to the power transistor.  Input Stage  There are two Schmitt triggers at the input pins IN+ and  IN- to improve noise immunity. In order to prevent the  output from accidentally turning on when the input is in  the floating state, IN+ is internally connected to a  pull-down resistor, and IN- is internally connected to a  pull-up resistor. The output signal depends on the logic  voltage levels on the IN+ and IN- pins (which are not a  differential input pair).  Output Stage  The SGM48521 provides 7A peak source and 6A sink  currents, and the outputs are separated to allow  custom pull-up and pull-down drive strength to suit the  application. Each of OUTH and OUTL pins can be  connected to transistor gates with separate drive  resistors, adjusting the driving speed of turning on and  off to control the slew rate and EMI of the driving signal  and the ringing on the gate signal. Controlling ringing  as much as possible reduces the stress on the driver  and switch device, which is very important for  high-performance applications and reliability of GaN  FETs. In order to prevent the device CISS from turning  the FET on by mistake, the OUTL pin will be pulled low  in under-voltage conditions.  VDD and Under-Voltage Lockout  The rated working voltage of SGM48521 is 5V ± 0.5V.  In the application, the error of the power supply of the  driver chip needs to be ensured within 10% (0.5V), and  the transient overshoot voltage of the power supply  cannot exceed the absolute maximum voltage of the  part. In the VDD Overshoot Solution section, there are  more specific design details.  The SGM48521 provides under-voltage lockout (UVLO)  function to protect the circuit in the event of a fault  condition. The UVLO rising trigger point is typically set  at 4.16V, and the hysteresis voltage is 75mV. This  UVLO level ensures that the GaN FET operates in the  low RDSON region. When UVLO is triggered, the output  is low.  Over-Temperature Protection (OTP)  The  SGM48521  provides  an  over-temperature  protection (OTP) function with a trigger point of +170℃.  The hysteresis temperature is 21℃. If the OTP is  triggered, switching action is stopped with OUTL held  low. Then when the junction temperature of the device  falls below +149℃, normal operation resumes.         5V, 7A/6A Low-Side GaN and  SGM48521  MOSFET Driver with 1ns Pulse Width      8  JANUARY 2024  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  "}'

In  addition, the gate driver can reduce switching losses  and maximize the performance of GaN transistors in  high-frequency applications. Especially in the field of  digital power control, it is common for the PWM signal  of the digital controller to be a 3.3V logic signal, and  GaN transistors cannot work optimally with this gate  voltage. The gate driver boosts the 3.3V signal to the  preferred gate drive voltage of 5V, which fully turns on  the power device and minimizes conduction losses.  The good noise immunity of the SGM48521 gate driver  also minimizes the effects of high frequency switching  noise when the driver is placed near the power switch.  Adding a gate driver also transfers the gate charge  power loss from the controller to the driver, which  effectively reduces the power consumption and thermal  stress in the controller.  The SGM48521 is a low-side high-speed gate driver  with a maximum operating frequency of 60MHz and an  operating voltage of 5V. It is optimized to drive GaN  FETs. The output has an independent configuration  architecture, which can flexibly adjust the turn-on and  turn-off speed, while providing a strong current sinking  and sourcing capabilities.  The SGM48521 is primarily used to drive GaN  transistors, which are used in various power converters,  LiDAR, wireless chargers, and synchronous rectifiers.  The SGM48521 can be used as a driver for high-speed  pulsed laser diodes.  Typical Application  A typical application circuit for the SGM48521 is  shown in Figure 1, with a single-channel, 5V drive  voltage, specifically designed to drive GaN transistors  or logic-level Si FETs. The output has a separated  structure, so that the turn-on and turn-off speeds can  be controlled separately by driving resistors. If it is not  necessary to adjust the turn-on and turn-off speeds  separately, OUTH and OUTL may be connected  directly together (with a single gate drive resistor  added if necessary).  In order to avoid voltage overstress caused by the  parasitic inductance of the drive circuit, SGMICRO  recommends using at least 2Ω resistors at OUTH and  OUTL.  For applications requiring a smaller resistance value,  please contact SGMICRO E2E for guidance.  Design Requirements  There are some key factors to consider when designing  with the SGM48521 gate driver and GaN power FETs,  especially for high MHz frequency (or nanosecond  pulse) applications. These factors include circuit layout,  PCB trace design, passive component selection, and  maximum operating frequency.  Detailed Design Procedure  Handling Ground Bounce  Place the ground pin of the SGM48521 as close as  possible to the source of the low-side FET to get the  smallest gate current loop, the smallest parasitic  inductance, and maximize the switching performance.  However, this can cause ground bounce on the  SGM48521, resulting in incorrect switching logic at the  input and wrong level at the output.  In order to eliminate this effect, SGM48521 has built-in  Schmitt triggers on the input terminals to increase the  input hysteresis. Equation 1 shows the relationship  between the input hysteresis and the maximum  allowable di/dt:  HYS P V di dt L =                  (1)  where  LP: Parasitic inductance between source and Ground.  VHYS: Hysteresis voltage of the input port.  di/dt: Current slew rate.           5V, 7A/6A Low-Side GaN and  SGM48521  MOSFET Driver with 1ns Pulse Width      9  JANUARY 2024  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued)  Assuming that the parasitic inductance is 0.5nH and  the hysteresis voltage is 0.5V, the maximum allowable  current slew rate is 1A/ns by calculation. If the current  slew rate generated in the application is higher than  1A/ns, this exceeds the hysteresis voltage range and  causes the output signal to be unstable. Using the  inverting input to accept the PWM signal and  connecting the non-inverting input to VDD can reduce  the possibility of false pulses or oscillations and  improve stability. High di/dt produces high transient  voltage spikes that affect the input of the SGM48521. In  order to protect the device from a large current spike at  IN-, a 100Ω current limiting resistor can be placed  before the IN- input.  If the current slew rate is not too high, and the pulse  width is not very short (for example, 1ns range), the  extra delay can be accepted. The parasitic capacitance  of the SGM48521 input can be used to create an RC  filter to reduce high-frequency noise by adding a  resistor in series with the input pin. The SGM48521 has  stable input capacitance of about 2.3pF at the input  pins, which is convenient for this purpose.  If the environment is more severe, using a common  mode choke coil can increase the stability of the  system.  In applications that use current sensing resistors, the  ground bounce phenomenon is particularly serious. In  the application circuit with current sense resistor shown  in Figure 3, the ground of the SGM48521 is connected  to the source of the GaN FET, and one side of the  current sense resistor is connected to the controller  ground. In the case of high-speed switching and large  current, the potential rebound due to the parasitic  inductance of the current detection resistor will cause  the circuit to turn on/off by mistake, and in severe cases  it may cause damage to the device. Figure 5 shows the  solution for this situation: Use a common mode choke  between the controller output and the SGM48521 input.  When the pulse width is not extremely narrow, a  resistor can also be added to the signal output line  before SGM48521 to form an RC filter as a supplement.  Although the circuit of Figure 4 improves the ground  bounce problem by connecting the GND of the driver to  the signal ground after the current sense resistor, this  circuit is not recommended. The drawback of this circuit  is that the voltage drop across the current sense  resistor and its parasitic inductance reduce the  transient and DC gate drive voltage to the FET, thus  reducing efficiency. In severe cases, the voltage ringing  caused by the inductance of the sense resistor path  can even cause the FET to spuriously turn on and off.   For these reasons, the circuit of Figure 5 is the  preferred solution to ground bounce problems.        GND OUTH OUTL RS SGM48521 R1 R2 GaN   GND OUTH OUTL RS SGM48521 R1 R2 GaN   Figure 3.

Filtering for Ground Bounce Noise Handling with SGM48521      Creating Nanosecond Pulse with SGM48521  SGM48521 can provide a minimum 1ns pulse width  output to capacitive load. However, outputting such a  small equivalent pulse width requires a very powerful  digital driver and also needs to consider the influence of  parasitic parameters from the digital output to the  SGM48521 input. Using the two inputs of SGM48521  and the AND gate can get a method of generating short  pulses at the output. As shown in Figure 6, connect one  digital signal to IN+, and the other delayed digital signal  to IN-, so that a narrow pulse will appear at the output,  the width of which is equal to the delay time of the two  digital signals. The digital controller only needs to  control the delay time in the range of nanoseconds,  which reduces the requirement for the SGM48521 input  signal. If the digital signal has only one output, an RC  low-pass filter can be used to generate a signal with an  adjustable delay time, which is related to the RC time  constant.

In the PCB design process, it is necessary to evaluate  and control the overshoot caused by the ringing, so as  not to exceed the stress of the device. The strength of  the overshoot voltage and the percentage of the  overshoot  duration  to  the  switching  time  are  parameters that affect the stress. Keeping the  overshoot below maximum allowable pin voltage is the  best solution. The parasitic inductance can be  decreased by optimizing PCB layout. To limit the  voltage overshoot, low ESL components and series  resistance can be helpful as well. If the overshoot is too  large, the accuracy of the power supply needs to be  considered. For example, if the overshoot voltage is  0.5V, the maximum error voltage of the power supply  cannot exceed 5.5V (10% accuracy). Therefore, if the  overshoot voltage is large, a power supply with higher  accuracy is necessary.  Applications at High Frequencies  SGM48521 has fast rise/fall time, and provides a  minimum output capability of 1ns pulse width and a  maximum operating frequency of 60MHz. According to  the capacitive load, different output modes and  frequencies can be selected. Under the working  condition of high-frequency pulse, in order to prevent  the device from overheating, a high-frequency pulse  train with a certain interval time can be used. This can  increase the transient frequency and keep the effective  value of the output current unchanged. At this time, a  larger decoupling capacitor is needed to charge the  capacitive load at a high frequency.  Power Supply Recommendations  In order to provide high peak current when the FET is  turned on and improve the stability of the VDD pin  supply voltage, a low ESR/ESL ceramic capacitor  needs to be used as a bypass capacitor placed as  close as possible to the IC's VDD and GND pins. To  avoid ringing at the IC pins as much as possible, the  decoupling capacitors need to be placed on the same  side as the IC, and vias cannot be used.  In order to achieve the best transient performance,  SGMICRO recommends choosing a three-terminal  capacitor and a capacitor with a larger capacitance in  parallel. The three-terminal capacitor needs to be  placed close to the VDD and GND pins of the IC, and  the other capacitor is placed close to the three-terminal  capacitor. The three-terminal capacitor has the lowest  ESL, and the larger capacitor provides enough drive  peak current. Under normal circumstances, it is  recommended to use 0.1µF 0402 or through-core  capacitors in parallel with 1µF 0603 capacitors.  Layout Guidelines  Proper PCB layout is extremely important in a  high-current,  fast-switching  circuit  to  provide  appropriate device operation and design robustness.  SGM48521 provides WLCSP ball grid array package,  which can reduce the parasitic inductance in the  connection line with BGA type GaN FET.  In order to achieve the best performance, a PCB with at  least four routing layers is recommended to minimize  the parasitic inductance. Using resistors and capacitors  in a smaller package (0201) can also minimize  inductance and PCB space. It is necessary to calculate  the resistor power of a small package to meet the  requirements of gate drive power loss.  Drive Loop Inductance and Grounding  SGM48521 should be placed as close to the GaN FET  as possible, and the trace of the gate drive circuit  should be as wide as possible to reduce parasitic  inductance.  To achieve minimum drive loop inductance, it is  recommended to use the second layer of the PCB as  the source loop of the GaN FET, near the bottom of the  device (top layer). Both the vias connected to the GND  pin and the source of the FET are connected to this  layer with minimal impedance. Please note that the  coupling of the ground plane will be decreased only  when the GND plane is connected to the source power  plane at the FET.       5V, 7A/6A Low-Side GaN and  SGM48521  MOSFET Driver with 1ns Pulse Width      12  JANUARY 2024  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued)  Bypass Capacitor  The VDD pin requires a bypass capacitor connected to  GND, as close to the pins of the SGM48521 as  possible. The capacitor should be connected to VDD  and GND power planes, which should be large and as  close to the top layer of the PCB as possible. Due to  the high operating frequency of the IC, the inductance  of the bypass capacitor is critical, so the value of the  bypass capacitor should be between 0.1µF and 1µF,  and the material should be X7R or better. The best  capacitors for the application are low inductance chip  capacitors  (LICC),  interdigital  capacitors  (IDC),  feedthrough and LGA capacitors. Finally, in order to  meet the demand of driving peak current, an extra 1μF  capacitor between VDD and GND should be added in  parallel close to the IC.
