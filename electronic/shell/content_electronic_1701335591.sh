The first  function of the EN/PWM pin is to enable the device. Set  EN/PWM high to enable the device from the shutdown  state. The device will enter shutdown mode if the  EN/PWM remains low and the holding time exceeds  tPWRDWN. The second function is to realize the current  sink ON and OFF control, to achieve the PWM dimming  control. When EN/PWM = high, the LED channel  current will quickly rise to ISET. When EN/PWM = low,  the LED channel current will quickly drop to 0.  The SGM3795 allows the LED channel to be turned ON  or OFF in a very short time.  It is recommended to use PWM signals from 100Hz to  5kHz for linear dimming, and the duty cycle can support  a minimum of 1%. In addition, the PWM frequency can  be up to 50kHz, but the duty cycle must be greater than  10%.  When operating at a low PWM frequency or low PWM  duty cycle, the SGM3795 may enter shutdown mode  due to PWM low time longer than tPWRDWN. However,  PWM dimming accuracy is not affected, because the  turn-on time tPS is less than 1µs and much shorter than  the PWM high or low time.  The EN/PWM high time must be longer than 3µs and  the EN/PWM low time must be longer than 1.5µs. In  this case, the PWM pulse can be reliably detected.    Basic Operation  By connecting an appropriate resistance in series at the  ISET pin, the SGM3795 can achieve four-channel  high-precision dimming control with a high matching  rate. The four LED channel currents obtain the same  reference current with the help of the current mirror,  and the formula is as follows:  LED ISET 1.2V I 110 R ≅ ×                (1)   The selections of typical resistance values and LED  channel current values are shown in Table 1.  Table 1.

However, too high of a current sink voltage will lead to  more power loss and overheating of the device.  Therefore, the current sink voltage is recommended to  control below 1.5V.  The SGM3795 supports up to 175mA per channel, and  headroom voltages higher than 275mV per LED  channel are required to ensure accurate channel  currents. Once VIN voltage drops below 2.4V, the  device will disable all LED channels due to UVLO.  Leave the unused pin open.  Tying the LED channels together allows the device to  be used for high than 175mA current application. The  SGM3795 supports up to 700mA application when all 4  LED channels are connected together.  In order to ensure the safe operation of the SGM3795,  the voltage of the LED channel needs to be controlled  below 22V.    LED Short Protection  The SGM3795 can detect an LED string short event.  When any LED pin’s current sink voltage is higher than  9.5V, a short event is detected, and the LED channel’s  current will drop to 40% of ISET to reduce the power  dissipation. The LED channel current will return to ISET  when the current sink voltage is dropped below 7.0V.    Thermal Shutdown  Thermal shutdown (TSD) is triggered when the device  die temperature reaches +150℃, and all LED channels  are disabled. The LED channels automatically starts up  again when the die temperature drops to +130℃.       700mA Quad Channel  SGM3795  Constant Current LED Driver      10  NOVEMBER 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  "}'

By adding resistor R2, Zener diode Z, and an N-channel  transistor M, SGM3795 can be powered with supply  voltage above 5.5V. On Semiconductor MM3Z6V2  Zener diode and 2N7002L N-channel transistor are  recommended.    Figure 4. 12V Power Supply Application with 12LEDs    Daylight Detection  SGM3795 can be used as a daylight detection circuit  with a light sensor, as shown in Figure 5. With light  sensor sensing the ambient brightness, the SGM3795  can be enabled during the day and disabled at night. A  resistor R1 is used to properly regulate the voltage of  the EN/PWM pin. Microsemi LX1972 is recommended  as the light sensor.    Figure 5. Daylight Detection    Nightlight Detection  SGM3795 can also be used as a nightlight detection  circuit with a light sensor, as shown in Figure 6. With  light sensors sensing the ambient brightness, the  SGM3795 can be disabled during the day and enabled  at night. In order to properly configure SGM3795 for  night detection, five external components need to be  configured in Figure 6. Similarly, Microsemi LX1972 is  recommended  as  the  light  sensor  and  ON  Semiconductor 2N7002L is recommended as the  N-Channel transistor.    Figure 6. Nightlight Detection    LED Current Derating  The circuit shown in Figure 7 protects the LED from  over-heating by derating the LED current to avoid  over-driving  the  LED  in  a  high-temperature  environment. In practical applications, a thermistor RPTC  can be used to sense the temperature of the LED, and  the RPTC should be placed as close as possible to the  LED. When the LED temperature increases, the gate  voltage of MOSFET M1 decreases, which leads to an  increase in the M1 on-resistance, resulting in a  decrease in the LED current. Vishay PTCSS12T071DTE  is  recommended  as  the  thermistor  and  ON  Semiconductor 2N7002L N-channel transistor are  recommended.  The PCB and heat dissipation for the LED should be  considered so that the LED current is constant within  the normal temperature range. However, once the  ambient temperature exceeds the maximum threshold,  this circuit will reduce the LED current to avoid LED  burnout.    Figure 7.

High VLEDN voltage and ILEDN current  will cause the SGM3795 to frequently enter the thermal  shutdown, especially in high temperature environments.  By inserting a suitable resistor with the LED string, the  VLEDN  can  be  reduced  to  reduce  the  power  consumption.  Two main heat dissipation paths determine the thermal  resistance. The first path is determined by the package,  which is the thermal resistance (θJC) of the connection  to the shell. The other path, depending on the layout, is  the thermal resistance (θCA) of the shell to the  environment. In summary, the thermal resistance to the  environment (θJA) is equal to:  JA JC CA θ θ θ = +                  (3)  When the package and layout are determined, the  operating junction temperature can be calculated by the  following equation:  JC CA JA J AMB D AMB D T T P (θ θ ) T P θ = + + = +        (4)  When mounted on a two-sided printed circuit board  with two square inches of copper, the θJA in the  TDFN-2×3-8L package is 51.7°C/W.  For example, the maximum power consumption for the  TDFN-2×3-8L at +30℃ is as follows:  JMAX AMB D JA T - T 150 - 30 P 2.32W θ 51.7 = = =       (5)    Recommended Layout  A small ceramic capacitor should be placed as close as  possible to the VIN pin to filter and regulate the power  supply. The RISET resistor is connected to the GND pin  of the SGM3795 by Kelvin connection. GND plane  must be as close as possible to the GND of LED power  to provide shortest possible return path and smallest  possible current loops.  Figure 8 shows the layout recommendation for the  SGM3795 in the TDFN package, which uses a  through-hole to connect the exposed pad to the large  ground plane underneath, allowing the board layout to  provide good heat consumption.
