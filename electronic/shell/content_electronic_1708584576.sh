When an I/O pin is configured as an  analog output, it is driven by a 12-bit VDAC. The VDAC  output range can be configured to 0V to VREF or 0V to 2  × VREF. When an I/O pin is configured as an ADC input,  it is an analog input to ADC by an analog multiplexer.  The ADC input range can be configured to VREF or 2 ×  VREF. The I/O pins can also be configured as digital  general-purpose input or output (GPIO) pins.  The SGM90508 contains an integrated 2.5V, 11ppm/℃  (TYP) reference that is turned off by default. And the  chip has an on-chip temperature sensor, which can  read out the die temperature through an ADC read  sequence.  The SGM90508 is available in Green TSSOP-16,  TQFN-3×3-16BL and WLCSP-2.05×2.05-16B packages.  It operates over an ambient temperature range of -40℃  to +105℃.  "}'

The VDAC  output range can be set to 0V to VREF or 0V to 2 × VREF. And  the output range configuration is shared by all channels. The  input code to the VDAC is straight binary, so the ideal output  voltage can be calculated based on the following equation:       × ×    IN OUT REF N D V  = G V 2   (1)  Where:  G = 1 for an output range of 0V to VREF or G = 2 for an output  range of 0V to 2 × VREF.  VREF = Voltage on the VREF pin.  DIN = Decimal equivalent of the binary code, which is loaded  to the DAC register. It can range from 0 to 4095.  N = 12.    IDAC Section  The output range of the IDAC channels is the same whether  the reference voltage is VREF or 2 × VREF. The input code to  the IDAC is straight binary. Therefore, the ideal output current  is given by      ×    IN OUT MAX N D I  = I 2   (2)  Where:  IMAX = Current full output range, which is typically 80mA.  DIN = Equal decimal code that is loaded to the DAC register. It  can range from 0 to 4095.  N = 12.    ADC Section  The ADC is a fast, 12-bit, unipolar power supply, SAR ADC.  Each conversion takes 2μs. The ADC input range can be  configured as 0V to VREF or 0V to 2 × VREF. All ADC channels  share the same input range. The ADC output code is straight  binary format. It is possible to set an I/Ox pin as both a DAC  and an ADC. In this case, the I/O is a DAC output, and at the  same time, the DAC voltage can be read back by an ADC  conversion and read sequence.    GPIO Section  Each I/Ox pins can be used as a GPIO pin. An output can be  set by write data register. An input can be read by  configuration register. When an I/Ox pin is set as an output, it  is possible to read its status by setting it as an input pin at the  same time as well.   When the I/O pins are configured as GPIOs, the according  input network circuit is powered by VDD, and all inputs  threshold and electrical limitations are restricted by VDD.     Internal Reference  The SGM90508 has an on-chip 2.5V reference. The internal  reference is powered off by default. To enable the internal  reference, the bit D9 is set in the power-down and reference  control register (refer to Table 18).    Reset Function  The SGM90508 has a hardware nRESET pin. A falling edge  on the nRESET pin will asynchronously reset all registers and  all I/O pins to the default status. It will take the chip about  250μs (MAX) to complete the reset. It is not suggested to do  any operation during this time.  The SGM90508 also has a software reset command that can  perform the reset function as same as the nRESET pin.    Temperature Sensor  The SGM90508 has an integrated temperature sensor that  can be used to estimate the temperature of die. The  temperature conversion time is 3μs if the ADC buffer is  enabled. If the buffer is disabled, the time is 3μs.   Calculation of the temperature is shown below:   When ADC gain = 1:    × × REF REF (ADC Code - (0.56/V )   4095) Temperature( ) = 25 +  (3.015   (2.5/V ℃ )) (3)   When ADC gain = 2:  × × × REF REF (ADC Code - (0.56/(2 V ))   4095) Temperature( ) = 25 +  (1.508   (2.5/V ℃ )) (4)   The codes range returned by the ADC is approximately 721 to  1144, and its temperature range is from -40℃ to +105℃.          8-Channel, 12-Bit, Configurable ADC/VDAC/IDAC  SGM90508  with On-Chip Reference, I2C Interface      17  DECEMBER 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued)  Serial Interface  The SGM90508 has a 2-wire, I2C-compatible serial interface.  The SGM90508 works as a slave device. A typical timing  diagram of I2C operation sequence is shown in Figure 1. The  device provides two modes: standard mode (100kHz) and  fast mode (400kHz). The SGM90508 has a 7-bit slave  address that six MSBs are set to 0b001000, and its LSB is set  by A0 address pin.

The data can be read back from a DAC only when  there is not an ADC conversion sequence taking place.  In a DAC data register readback sequence, the second byte  is the point address byte. The point byte is composed of  0b0101 (D[7:3]) and the bit D[3:0] that select the DAC  channel to be read back. And when the 16-bit data of DAC  data register is read back, the first 4-bit is '0b1xxx', and the  following 12-bit is the register data (the data format is shown  in Table 9). The D[15] bit is set to '1' which indicates that this  is a result the DAC register. The D[14:12] shows the DAC  register address.    An Example of DAC Input Register Readback  The data in the DAC2 input register can be read back in the  following examples.  1. The first byte is composed of 7-bit chip address and 1-bit  writing bit.  2. The second byte is pointer address byte 0b01010010  (pointer address = 0b0101 + DAC2 address).  3.

Each serial current data transfer selects  the next channel for conversion. Before start a conversion,  the ADC sequence register must be set (as show in Table 10  and Table 11). In the ADC sequence register, the REP bit can  be set to let the ADC repeat the conversion sequence.  After the sequence register setting is completed, the ADC  begins to process the first channel in sequence. ADC data  can be read out by any available format, if multi-channel is  enabled, block reading is more efficient.  If multi-channel is enabled, the ADC converts all enabled  channels in ascending order. Conversion is triggered by the  rising edge of SCL at the acknowledge (ACK) before the  MSB.   If REP bit is enabled in ADC sequence register, the ADC will  repeat the conversion sequence if all the selected channels  have been converted. If REP bit is cleared during the cycle,  the ADC will finish the current conversion and send out the  result in subsequent I2C ADC data reading.  The ADC conversion result of one channel is a 16-bit format  data. The D[15] bit is set to '0' which indicates that this is an  ADC result data. The D[14:12] shows the ADC channel  address. The following 12-bit D[11:0] is the ADC data (the  data format is shown in Table 11).  In the section of An Example of Configuring the ADC for  Conversion, shows the example of how to configure I/O7 and  I/O0 and read ADC conversion result.  The ADC sequence can be re-configured if there is not an  on-going conversion. When a new ADC sequence is set, ADC  ignores all to be converted channels which are selected in  previous setting and will start in new sequence immediately.  Clear the REP, TEMP and according ADC selected bits can  stop the ADC conversion sequence.     Table 10.

The first step is setting I/O7 and I/O0 for ADC (configure ADC  pin configuration register).  1. The first byte is composed of 7-bit chip address and 1-bit  writing bit.  2. The second byte is pointer address byte 0b00000100 (ADC  pin configuration register).  3.

The forth byte is the least significant data byte  (0b10000001) to be written to target register (ADC Pin  Configuration register).  The second step is setting ADC7 and ADC0 for ADC  (configure ADC sequence register).  1. The first byte is composed of 7-bit chip address and 1-bit  writing bit.  2. The second byte is pointer address byte 0b00000010 (ADC  sequence register).  3.

The forth byte is the least significant data byte  (0b10000001) to be written to target register (ADC sequence  register).  The third step is selecting ADC7 for ADC readback (configure  ADC readback) and read ADC data by block read.  1. The first byte is composed of 7-bit chip address and 1-bit  writing bit.  2. The second byte is pointer address byte 0b01000000 (ADC  address ADC7).  3. The third byte is composed of 7-bit chip address and 1-bit  reading bit.  4. The forth byte is the MSB byte of ADC7 conversion result  (MSB byte = 1-bit 0b0 + 3-bit ADC7 address + 4-bit MSB of  12-bit ADC7 data).  5. The fifth byte is the LSB byte of ADC7 conversion result  (LSB byte = 8-bit data of 12-bit ADC7 data).  6. If continuously read, the sixth byte is the MSB byte of  ADC0 conversion result (MSB byte = 1-bit 0b0 + 3-bit ADC0  address + 4-bit MSB of 12-bit ADC0 data).  7. If continuously read, the seventh byte is the LSB byte of  ADC0 conversion result (LSB byte = 8-bit data of 12-bit ADC0  data).  And so on, repeating 4 ~ 7 operations. If the reading does not  stop, the data of ADC7 and ADC0 will keep being updated  and reported.

There is no dedicated control for the ADC  power-down, but the ADC is automatically powered down if  there is no an ADC operation.    Reset Function  The SGM90508 can be reset by setting the reset register  (pointer byte = 0b00001111). This operation resets all  registers to the default values.  The SGM90508 can be reset to its default conditions by  writing 0x0DAC to the reset register (pointer byte =  0b00001111).
