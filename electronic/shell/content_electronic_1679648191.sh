The input voltage  range is from 2.3V to 5.5V and the unregulated output  equals to -VIN. For the regulated output of the SGM2058,  it equals to -VCTL and the range is from 0V to -VIN.  The inrush current of the SGM2058 can be decreased  by the internal soft-start circuit.    Negative Charge Pump  The technology of getting -VIN (unregulated output) is  by using the switched capacitors. Use an integrated  oscillator to create a switching signal for driving the  charge pump. The switching frequency of the oscillator  is from 80kHz to 1875kHz (TYP). Also, the switching  frequency can be changed with the dropout voltage  between VIN and VOUT1. When heavy load occurs, this  frequency will increase to compensate the output  ripple.  The SGM2058 will assume that there is an over-current  condition if VOUT1 < VIN/2, so that the switching  frequency of oscillator will be forced at 80kHz for  fold-back.    Negative Linear Regulator  The negative linear regulator VOUT2 is integrated with  the charge pump which powers it. For the properties of  the internal regulator, the dropout voltage, quiescent  supply and the output noise are extremely low. Also,  the range is from 0V to VOUT1.  VOUT2 is controlled by the feedback loop of the linear  regulator and the relationship between VCTL and VOUT2  is VCTL = -VOUT2. Also, the regulator provides a  convenient interface for DAC, and the output of the  SGM2058 can be driven by the input of DAC directly.  The output ripple of the negative linear regulator is  extremely low because of the special design of Power  Supply Rejection Ratio for its charge pump.    Output Voltage Setting  The absolute output voltage of the internal regulator is  equal to VCTL, which means that VOUT2 = -VCTL. The  analog input pin (CTL) can be connected directly to the  output of DAC. The application circuit is shown as  below:  SGM2058 DAC Input CTL OUT2 Output     Figure 3. Output Voltage Setting    Enable Operation  The SGM2058 uses the EN pin to enable/disable the  device and to deactivate/activate the output automatic  discharge function.  When the EN pin voltage is lower than 0.4V, the device  is in shutdown state. There is no current flowing from IN  to OUT pins. In this state, the automatic discharge  transistor is active to discharge the output voltage  through RDIS1 (typically 130Ω) and RDIS2 (typically 125Ω).  When the EN pin voltage is higher than 1.2V, the device  is in active state. The output voltage is regulated to the  expected value and the automatic discharge transistor  is turned off.    Equivalent Output Resistance  The charge pump frequency and fly capacitor  determine the output resistance of the SGM2058 as  shown in the following equation:  = + × × O  ON FLY 1 R      8   R f   C          (1)  where:  RON is the on-resistance of each charge pump  MOSFET.  The output current (IO) and resistance (RO) determine  the charge pump output VOUT1 as shown in the following  equation:  VOUT1 = - (VIN - IO × RO)            (2)    Soft-Start  Soft-start circuitry is integrated into the IC, which  supplies the controlled slew rate for the output voltage  of the linear regulator to prevent the SGM2058 from  overshoot at the instant of start-up. The typical ramp-up  time is within 500μs (TYP). For the typically value of  slew-rate, it can reach 10V/ms (TYP).         Negative Charge Pump  SGM2058  and Adjustable Regulator      9  MARCH 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued)  Load Capability  The summation of IOUT1 and IOUT2 should be less than  265mA (TYP) because of the limitation of the load  capability. Also, the changes of load capability are  associated with output and fly capacitors. If the  selected capacitors are smaller, the load capability will  be decreased.    Input Capacitor Selection (CIN)  The input decoupling capacitor is necessary to be  connected as close as possible to the IN pin. A 1μF to  10μF dielectric X7R or X5R ceramic capacitor is  selected to get good dynamic performance.    Output Capacitor Selection (COUT1, COUT2)  The output decoupling capacitors should be located as  close as possible to the OUT pins. A 1μF capacitor for  COUT1 and a 1μF to 10μF capacitor for COUT2 are  selected to get good dynamic performance. For ceramic  capacitor, temperature, DC bias and package size will  change the effective capacitance, so enough margins  of COUT1 and COUT2 must be considered in design.    Fly Capacitor Selection (CFLY)  According to Equation 1, the output voltage and  resistance will be affected by the capacitance of the  CFLY. If the users prepare to use the charge pump in  heavy load condition, it is recommended to set a larger  capacitor than normal to handle this situation. For  application, the CFLY should be closed to both CIN and  COUT1, and it is a good choice to set the capacitance of  these three capacitors equally.    Thermal Shutdown Protection  The SGM2058 can detect the temperature of die. When  the die temperature exceeds the threshold value of  thermal shutdown, the SGM2058 will be in shutdown  state and it will remain in this state until the die  temperature decreases to +140℃ (TYP).    Under-Voltage Lockout (UVLO)  The UVLO circuit monitors the input voltage to prevent  the device from turning on before VIN rises above the  VUVLO threshold. The UVLO circuit responds quickly to  glitches on the IN pin and attempts to disable the output  of the device if either of these rails collapses. The local  input capacitance prevents severe brownouts in most  applications.    PCB Layout  To obtain better performance of the SGM2058, the  input and output bypass capacitors must be placed as  close as possible to the IN pin and OUTx pins  separately. There are four high-current paths which are  GND, IN, CP and CN. The short and wide traces must  be used to connect these pins.                        "}'
