The common mode range  extends 0.2V beyond the power supply voltage rails.    Operating Voltage  The SGM8752-1/2/3 can operate from 2.7V to 5.5V  single supply or from ±1.35V to ±2.75V dual supplies  over the -40℃ to +125℃ temperature range.    Input Over-Voltage Protection  In the internal of SGM8752-1/2/3, ESD diodes are used  to protect these devices from higher voltages (300mV  greater than the supply voltage). However, adding a  resistor at the input of the comparator is a good choice  to absorb the momentary voltage which is greater than  300mV by limiting the current within 10mA.

If  there is a high-level voltage added at the shutdown pin,  the operating current is 0.1μA and the output impedance  is significantly high. On the other hand, if a low-level  voltage is presented at the shutdown pin, the comparator  will be operational and the output impedance is low. It is  recommended to connect the shutdown pin to -VS if the  shutdown feature is not used. And, it will take 100ns to  active the device if exiting the shutdown mode.

The output will switch as  the result of the input noise, although there is 6mV  internal hysteresis. For this case, it is recommended to  add external resistors at the positive terminal of the  comparator. For the circuit which is shown in Figure 4,  the external 25mV hysteresis is added so the total  hysteresis is 31mV, which will improve the noise  immunity. The equation shown as below is used to  calculate the total supported hysteresis of the circuit.  ( ) + × S 1 HYST 1 2 V    R V  =   + 6mV R  + R           (1)  VHYST is the required transition voltage range for  switching these devices; therefore, the noise immunity  is improved.

Adding Hysteresis to the SGM8752-1    Relaxation Oscillator  A relaxation oscillator can be made by SGM8752-1/2/3  due to their high speed property. For the following  circuit, the R2 network with the same resistance sets  two trip points which are 1/3VS and 2/3VS. The  resistance of R2 network should be small enough to  reject the effect of parasitic capacitance as the operation  of SGM8752-1/2/3 is high speed. The 1/3VS and 2/3VS  are the two thresholds of the input signal, which can  switch the output of the signal. Also, after calculation,  the sum of charging and discharging period is 2ln2 ×  R1C. With the application which is shown as below, the  calculated oscillated frequency is equal to 10.9MHz.  However, because of the parasitic capacitance, the  theoretical frequency is around 9.6MHz.  Design Requirements  For the R2 network, the users must set values of three  resistors equally to ensure that the two trip points are  equal to 1/3VS and 2/3VS. Also, the resistance of R2  network should be small enough to reject the effect of  parasitic capacitance. In addition, there are two  requirements for the value of R1, which are drawing  less current and providing high switching frequency. On  top of this, higher capacitance for the capacitor is  required for improving the error which is caused by the  tolerance and parasitic capacitance.    Detailed Design Procedure  For the application, the positive input, +VIN is equal to  the 1/3VS if the VOL is close to GND. And +VIN is equal  to 2/3VS if the VOH is close to VS.  The charging and discharging periods at the negative  input and which are reflected at VC, are the same, and  the value of charging and discharging period is equal to  R1C.    2/3VS 1/3VS +VS 1.38R1C t VC + _ R2 = 5kΩ R1 = 1kΩ R2 = 5kΩ R2 = 5kΩ C = 62pF VS = 5V +VS SGM8752-1 VOUT t f = 10MHz     Figure 5.

Because  SGM8752-1/2/3 are high speed comparators, it is excellent to use these devices for the designing of a high speed  window comparator, with two thresholds VHI and VLO. If the voltage level of VIN is between the two thresholds of the  circuit, the output of the circuit will be in high position. For the application of active low which is shown in Figure 7,  the position of VHI and VLO is different from the application in Figure 6. On top of this, the supported voltage ranges  for both of the applications are from 2.7V to 5.5V.    + _ + _ VHI VIN VLO VOUT SGM8752-2 SGM8752-2 V VHI VLO VIN VOUT Time     Figure 6.

For the noisy or high impedance  power supply condition, a bypass capacitor should be  added closed to the power supply pin to enhance the  stability. The section of Layout illustrates how to place  the bypass capacitor.    Layout  An excellent design for PCB layout is necessary for  high speed devices. Any stray capacitance or improper  grounding will influence the performance of the high  speed comparator.  In order to minimize the propagation delay, the users  should make sure that the resistance of the signal  source is as low as possible. The resistance from the  input signal and the stray capacitance can create an  RC filter, which can decrease the amplitude for  high-frequency component. In addition, the input  capacitance and the stray capacitance result in several  pF capacitances.  The paralleled 2.2μF and 0.1μF ceramic capacitors  need to be placed as close to the device. The 2.2μF  capacitor is used to enhance the stability by rejecting  the ripple, and 0.1μF capacitor provides a charge for  high-frequency component.  For high speed applications, the rising or falling edge of  the signal will cause a potential DC voltage shift. For  minimizing this negative influence, a plane of GND  should be taken into account as it can reduce the effect  of stray capacitance. Also, the ground plane can  provide multiple paths for the current flow. In addition,  for the high speed signal, the current will flow back at  GND plane under its previous signal path. Any hole and  via can increase the inductance which can reduce the  performance of the high speed transmission. If vias are  necessary at the ground plane, please place them  randomly.
