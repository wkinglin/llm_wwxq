The SGM6021 operation voltage range is from 1.8V to  5.5V, allowing the use of a regulated 5V input. The  output regulator levels are programmed through VS pin  and can be programmed for 4 different voltages,  making it ideal for designing device with limited power  budget calculation.  The SGM6021 delivers an output current of 200mA with  a peak inductor current of 430mA. Besides, the  SGM6021 series has the under-voltage lockout (UVLO)  function. It is disabled when the voltage on VIN reaches  the UVLO condition. The SGM6021’s under-voltage  lockout level is continuously monitored. Only inductor,  CIN and COUT capacitors are needed as external  components to make a Buck DC/DC converter solution.   The SGM6021 is available in a Green UTDFN-1.5×2-6L  package.  "}'

The  device is improved to provide high efficiency ranging  from 10μA to 200mA. The SGM6021 family equips an  externally regulated supply that is programmable. Thus,  the power-management stage efficiency is maintained.  The SGM6021 implements the hysteretic control  architecture to regulate the output voltage. The 400nA  (TYP) quiescent current extends the operation lifetime  for battery operated applications.    Operation  The SGM6021 family is a Buck converter that is  capable to regulate the voltage that is lower than the  input voltage at the output. The device implements the  pulse frequency modulation (PFM) control to regulate  the voltage at light load. The SGM6021 delivers an  average output current of 200mA with a peak inductor  current of 430mA (TYP). The device implements an  input under-voltage lockout (UVLO) function. When the  input voltage drops below the UVLO threshold, the  device stops operation. In addition to input UVLO  function, the SGM6021 also implements the VS pin to  allow external signal to control the turn-on and turn-off  of the device. The device also implements output  discharge function, when the VS pin is pulled to logic  low, the low-side power FET remains on to discharge  the output voltage. The SGM6021 also implements 100%  duty cycle mode to bypass the input voltage to the  output when the input voltage is above the UVLO  threshold.            400nA Ultra-Low Power, Buck Converter  SGM6021  with 200mA Output Current    10  OCTOBER 2022  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued)  Effective Pulse at VS Pin  A pulse with width less than tPULSE is treated as an  effective pulse. Consecutive pulses will be counted if  delay between adjacent pulses is within the tSTOP.  Please refer to Figure 3 for a graphical explanation.      Figure 3. Effective Pulse at VS Pin    VS Pin Interface Functions  In order to enable the IC from shutdown mode, two  conditions must be met:  1. VIN voltage is higher than UVLO threshold.  2. VS pin is floating or VS pin stays logic high for at  least tBLANK + tSS time.   After that, the pulses at VS pin become effective and  can be used to shut down the IC or program the output  voltage. The following are the three cases that the VS  pin affects the regulator:  1. 1 pulse followed by VS pin being low for longer than  tOFF will shut down the regulator.  During the tOFF-HOLD time after shutdown, the pulses  applied to VS Pin are ignored.  To restart the regulator, the VS pin must be pulled high  for at least tSS time.  2. 2~5 pulses followed by VS pin being high for longer  than tOFF will set the output voltage to the default, V1,  V2 and V3 respectively.  3. 2 or more pulses followed by VS pin being low for  longer than tOFF will set the output voltage to the default  value.  Other pulse patterns will have no effects on the IC.        Figure 4. Program Output Voltage via VS Pin    Under-Voltage Lockout (UVLO)  The device monitors the input voltage and shuts down  itself when the input voltage is lower than UVLO  threshold voltage. When the input voltage is higher  than the UVLO threshold plus hysteresis, the device  will start again.    Thermal Shutdown (TSD)  A thermal shutdown function is implemented to prevent  the damage caused by excessive heat and power  dissipation. Once a temperature of +160°C (TYP) is  exceeded, the device is shut down. The device is  released from shutdown automatically when the  junction temperature decreases by 20℃.    Nano-Power Management and Efficiency  The SGM6021 implements the nano-power circuitry  and algorithm to achieve 400nA (TYP) quiescent  current. This feature is accomplished through sampling  and all references are saved, so as to lower the  average quiescent current. During the sampling and  saving, the internal circuits are only turned on for a  short period of time and then turned off in the remaining  time at the lowest feasible duty cycle.       3ms < tPULSE <6ms 3ms < tPULSE <6ms tOFF tSS tOFF-HOLD Default tSTOP tSTOP tSTOP tSTOP tBLANK Default Default tSTOP tSS VCC VOUT VS V3 V2 Output default voltage Setting VS low for longer than  tOFF after one pulse at VS pin,  the regulator will shut down. For startup from shutdown,  5 pulses at VS pin after  tOFF-HOLD + tSS, and setting  VS high for longer than  tSTOP, output V3. 1 pulse at VS  pin and setting  VS high for  longer than  tSTOP, output last  set voltage (V3). 4 pulses at VS pin and  setting VS low for longer  than tSTOP, output default  voltage. Setting VS high for  longer than tSTOP, output V2. 6 pulses at VS pin and  setting VS high for  longer than tSTOP, output  last set voltage (V2).  400nA Ultra-Low Power, Buck Converter  SGM6021  with 200mA Output Current    11  OCTOBER 2022  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  "}'

Design Procedure  A 10μH inductor (Toko DFE2520- 12C) and a 22μF  input ceramic capacitor are recommended for the  SGM6021. Since the device only supports 200mA  output load, a 22μF output ceramic capacitor is  sufficient. For applications that are expected to have a  large transient event, use ITRAN = COUT × ΔVOUT/ΔTIME to  size the output capacitor accordingly, where ΔVOUT is  the amount of output voltage drop during load step.     Inductor Selection  The SGM6021 is optimized to work with a 4.7μH  inductor. The selected inductor’s saturation current  should be at least 25% higher than the maximum  cycle-by-cycle current limit specified in the Electrical  Characteristics table. The SGM6021 is naturally stable  due to its hysteretic control architecture.  The recommended inductors for SGM6021 are shown  in Table 1.    Table 1.

Larger size will result in  higher effective capacitance under the same DC  de-rating, which improves the transient response and  output ripple.     Input Capacitor Selection  A 22μF ceramic capacitor and a 0.1μF ceramic bypass  input capacitor are recommended to place between the  VIN pin and GND as close as possible to minimize the  parasitic inductance. For applications where the  SGM6021 is located far away from the input source, a  22µF or higher capacitor is recommended to damp the  inductance of the wiring harness.       400nA Ultra-Low Power, Buck Converter  SGM6021  with 200mA Output Current      12  OCTOBER 2022  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  "}'
