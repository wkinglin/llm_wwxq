It  integrates the function of true output disconnect and is  able to start up with 0.8V (TYP) input. The fixed  frequency peak current control mode is adopted as the  control architecture. The built-in soft-start feature and  loop compensation simplify the design and minimize  the number of external components. The internal low  RDSON power MOSFETs ensure high efficiency under  heavy current load and power-save mode operation  enables high efficiency under light current load.  Synchronous Rectifier  The synchronous rectification function is realized by an  internal N-channel MOSFET and a P-channel MOSFET.  Compared with the traditional Schottky diode, the  PMOS can improve the operating efficiency.  True disconnection function is realized by controlling  the body diode of the rectifier PMOS. This feature  ensures that there is no leakage current path between  input and output even the device is disabled.  Start-Up  The SGM66025 starts up with a 720mA precharge  current to charge the output voltage to VIN - 270mV by  turning on the PMOS. The current limiting function  ensures the safety of the device under short-circuit  conditions.  The SGM66025 starts switching after precharge phase.  The device operates in free-running mode when VOUT is  below 1.77V. The switching frequency is fixed at  500kHz in this mode and the duty cycle is fixed to  around 70%. The switching current is limited to about  800mA.  The internal soft-start follows the FB voltage during the  precharge and free running period. Once the output  voltage  exceeds  1.77V,  the  device  will  enter  closed-loop control, the output voltage will be controlled  by soft-start and the current limit threshold goes to 1.5A.  When the soft-start is complete, the current limit  threshold is set to 1.8A. It then works in Boost mode or  Down mode depending on the voltage value of VIN and  VOUT. If VIN is 270mV higher than the preset voltage of  VOUT at start-up, the chip will continue to work in  Bypass mode. Please refer to Table 1 for more details  about operating modes.  Table 1. Operation Mode during Start-Up Sequence  VOUT < VIN - 270mV  Bypass Mode  VOUT ≥ VIN - 270mV & VOUT < 1.77V  Free Running  VIN - 270mV < VOUT < VIN + 250mV &  VOUT ≥ 1.7V  Down Mode  VOUT >VIN + 250mV & VOUT ≥ 1.77V  Boost Mode  When VOUT is greater than VIN, the SGM66025 is  powered by VOUT instead of VIN in normal mode. The  device is able to operate down to 0.6V, thus only the  energy of battery will limit the application.  Device Enable  The device is enabled when EN is pulled higher than  0.8VIN. It will be shut down when EN is grounded. In  shutdown mode, the device turns off all power  MOSFETs and logic circuits, and the body diode of the  rectifier PMOS is reversed to achieve complete  isolation of input and output.  Power-Save Mode  When the load is lightened, the device enters  power-save mode (PSM). When the VOUT drops below  the programmed threshold, several successive pulses  are performed in PWM mode logic to restore the VOUT.  Once VOUT returns to the programmed value, the  power-save mode will resume. Power-save mode  consumes  less  circuit  resources,  and  power  consumption is significantly reduced. The control mode  of the device is the peak current control mode through  sampling the voltage of FB.  Typically, output voltage ripple can be reduced to less  than 1% of the peak-to-peak output value by adding  output capacitor. Whether the device operates in PSM  or PWM depends on load current, output capacitance,  input voltage, output voltage, and inductor value.       0.8V Start-Up Input Voltage, 1.8A ISW Synchronous  SGM66025  Boost Converter with Load Disconnect      10  DECEMBER 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued)  Under-Voltage Lockout  Under-voltage lockout protection will be triggered when  the voltage of VIN pin falls below 0.5V (TYP) and the  device will stop switching.  Error Amplifier  The voltage of FB pin and the internal 1.20V reference  will be used as input signals of the error amplifier. The  error signal generated during this process is compared  with the sampled inductor peak current to adjust the  switching duty cycle to regulate the output voltage.   Current Sensing  The current flowing through the NMOS is sampled as a  voltage signal that will be summed with a slope  compensation signal used for PWM duty cycle  generation. The leading edge blanking time of 60ns  enhances the noise suppression during current  sampling. The peak current is limited to around 1.8A.  Thermal Protection  To protect the device from damage due to overheating,  a thermal shutdown feature is implemented to disable  the device when the die temperature exceeds +140℃ (TYP). The chip is automatically enabled when the  temperature falls below +125 ℃ (15 ℃ hysteresis,  TYP).  Output Disconnect and Inrush Limiting  The SGM66025 integrates the function of true output  disconnection by switching the internal PMOS body  diode direction. The true disconnect function ensures  that the VOUT pin cannot maintain any voltage or sink  any current. Inrush and surge currents from the input  supply are limited by precharge circuit.  When the external Schottky diode between SW and  VOUT is connected, the true disconnect function is  disabled.  To reduce the spike voltage on the SW pin, please keep  the output capacitor close to the VOUT pin and GND  pin. Using low ESR/ESL ceramic capacitors will  achieve better filtering.  Short-Circuit Protection  The  SGM66025  implements  output  short-circuit  protection by turning off the NMOS when the output  voltage drops below 1V. Then the device enters in  Bypass mode as power-on period. The thermal  regulation loop will also control the current flows  through PMOS when the die temperature exceeds the  over-temperature threshold.  Down Mode (VIN - 270mV < VOUT < VIN +  250mV) Operation  The SGM66025 will continue to regulate the output  voltage when the input voltage operates in a range that  is very close to the output voltage. The VGS of the  PMOS is dynamically adjusted to provide a down slope  to the inductor current, thus higher efficiency can be  achieved than in the conventional Down mode. When  VIN gradually approaches VOUT, the system will  dynamically adjust the frequency since VIN > VOUT +  0.7V, from 1MHz in normal operation to a minimum of  300kHz. In this mode, the peak current is limited to  around 600mA.   Bypass (VOUT + 270mV < VIN) Operation  When the input voltage is larger than VOUT + 270mV,  the SGM66025 works in Bypass mode, which includes  linear charging of output capacitance during start-up  and bypass operation in steady state. In this mode, the  rectifier MOSFET is always on, and the load current  flows only through the rectifier PMOS, the current  limiting threshold is around 720mA in bypass mode.       0.8V Start-Up Input Voltage, 1.8A ISW Synchronous  SGM66025  Boost Converter with Load Disconnect      11  DECEMBER 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  "}'

Setting R1 larger than 300kΩ is recommended  for better stability.  Input Capacitor Selection  For better filtering, the low ESR ceramic capacitors are  recommended to be used as input capacitor. Placing  the input capacitors as close to the device as possible  to reduce noise from power supply. Add a 10µF  ceramic capacitor in parallel with a 100nF ceramic  capacitor is recommended.  Output Capacitor Selection  To ensure the loop stability, please use a minimum  capacitor of 22µF as the output capacitor and low ESR  ceramic capacitors are recommended. The larger  output capacitance will improve the transient response  while reduce the output ripple.

Inductor Selection  The SGM66025 operates at a fixed switching frequency  of 1MHz in most situations, a 3.3µH inductor is  recommended for majority of applications. Large  inductors can slightly reduce the PSM operating  threshold and increase the load current capability by  reducing the ripple current.

In general,  high frequency ferrite-core inductors help reduce  frequency-dependent power losses. Try to use low  DCR inductance, when the DCR is much lower than  RDSON, the efficiency will be significantly improved. Also,  make sure that the saturation current of the inductor is  higher than the current limit.  PCB Layout Considerations  In order to avoid poor performance, EMI problems, and  resistance losses, please refer to the following  recommendations to optimize the PCB layout.  1. Add an about 100nF decoupling capacitor as close  as possible to the VOUT and GND pins. Adding vias on  VOUT net near the output capacitance will increase the  parasitic inductance, which is not beneficial to reduce  the spike voltage of the SW pin.  2. Using short and wide path to connect the power  devices (Such as input capacitor, output capacitor, and  inductor).  3. Feedback divider resistors should be close to AGND.  4. Use a larger copper area to increase heat  dissipation.    Figure 3.
