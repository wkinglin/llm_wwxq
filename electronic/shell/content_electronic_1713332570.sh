The two channels of  high-side and low-side are totally independent with 3ns  (TYP) delay matching between the turn-on and turn-off  of each other.  The maximum withstanding voltage of the input stage  of SMG48211 is 20V. Due to the -10VDC voltage  endurance capacity of its input stage, the driver has  enhanced robustness and can be interfaced to pulse  transformers directly without using rectifier diodes. With  a wide input hysteresis, the device can receive analog  or digital PWM signals with improved noise immunity.  A 120V rated bootstrap diode is integrated internally to  save the external diode and reduce PCB dimension  size.  Under-voltage lockout (UVLO) is integrated in both the  high-side and the low-side drivers. The output of each  channel is forced low if the corresponding driving  voltage falls below the specified threshold.  The SGM48211 is available in Green SOIC-8, SOIC-8  (Exposed Pad) and TDFN-4×4-8AL packages.  "}'

Typical Application Diagram    The capacitance value of the bootstrap capacitor is  recommended to be less than 680nF to prevent  excessive transient current breakdown of the bootstrap  diode when charging the bootstrap capacitor.  If the QG of the power transistor is particularly large and  requires a capacitor greater than 680nF, a resistor can  be directly connected in series with bootstrap capacitor  at the HB pin to reduce the transient current. A 1Ω to  2Ω series resistance is recommended. It is also  important to note that this series resistance also  increases the total turn-on resistance.  A Schottky diode is recommended to clamp the HS  voltage slightly lower than VSS during large di/dt as  shown in the dashed box in Figure 1. Connect the  diode between HS pin and VSS pin directly and tie the  cathode of the diode to HS pin. Its minimum blocking  voltage should be larger than the maximum positive  voltage of the half bridge.                   120V Boot, 4A Peak, High Frequency  SGM48211  High-side and Low-side Driver      6  APRIL 2024  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  "}'

Highlights of the SGM48211 are listed in Table 1. Due  to the combination of these features, the device can  operate with high frequency and robustness.    Table 1. Prominent Features and Benefits  Feature  Benefit  4A peak source and sink current.  To drive large power MOSFET and minimum switching losses.  Wide input withstanding voltage range of -10V to 20V VDC.  High robustness and reliability. Can be used in various  applications.  120V internal bootstrap diode.  Large margin to meet telecom 100V surge requirements and  reduce system cost.  Robust ESD circuitry.  Improved immunity to Common Mode (CM) and Differential  Mode (DM) noises.  31ns (TYP) propagation delay.  Low current distortion.  3ns (TYP) delay matching between channels.  Better Symmetry of Positive and Negative waveform.  Both high-side and low-side drivers feature UVLO circuit.  Ensures two channels shutdown simultaneously.  CMOS/TTL optimized thresholds with wide voltage hysteresis. Improved noise immunity.    Input Stage  The input of each channel is designed with 68kΩ input  impedance (internal pull-down to VSS). The input stages  of the SGM48211 are CMOS/TTL compatible and  designed with 2.25V logic high and 1.55V logic low  thresholds, 68kΩ equivalent input impedance. A 68kΩ  pull-down resistor is integrated internally in each  channel.    Output Stage  Both output stages of the two drivers are designed to  source and sink 4A peak current. Thus it allows for  driving MOSFETs with high current capability and low  switching losses. VSS is the reference ground of the  low-side output stage and HS is the reference ground  of the high-side output stage.    Under-Voltage Lockout (UVLO)  UVLO protections are implemented in both bias  supplies of the high-side and low-side drivers. Once  triggered, the VDD UVLO disables both drivers while the  VHB UVLO only disables the high-side driver. The rising  UVLO thresholds of VDD and VHB are 7V with 0.5V  hysteresis and 6.4V with 1V hysteresis respectively.    Level Shift  A level shift circuit is integrated to shift the input signal  to the output stage of the high-side driver and provides  the minimum delay matching with the low-side driver.    Bootstrap Diode  A 120V rated bootstrap diode is internally connected  between VDD and HB pins of the SGM48211 for  generating the high-side bias. During turn-on of the  low-side MOSFET in each cycle, the capacitor  connected between the HB and HS pins is charged  from VDD to HS through the bootstrap diode which  provides fast recovery time and low diode resistance  for efficient operation.    Device Functional Modes  When the SGM48211 operates in normal mode  (inactive UVLO), the outputs (HO and LO) of both  drivers follow their corresponding input signals (HI and LI)  as listed in Table 2.

The SGM48211 is designed with low propagation  delays and adopts low-inductance and compact  package. It is available to drive wide band-gap power  device such as GaN based switches for supporting very  high switching frequency and low-cost component  count.  Design Requirements  Table 3. Design Specifications  Design Parameter  Example Value  Supply Voltage, VDD  12V  Voltage on HS, VHS  0V to 100V  Voltage on HB, VHB  12V to 112V  Output Current Rating, IO  -4A to 4A  Operating Frequency  500kHz    Input Threshold Type  The SGM48211 can handle a maximum input voltage  range from -10V to 20V to achieve enhanced  robustness and allow compatibility with both inputs  from microcontrollers, as well as higher-voltage inputs  from gate-drive transformers. The inputs adopt TTL and  CMOS compatible structure with a wide range of  hysteresis. The voltage threshold is independent of  VDD.    Supply Voltage VDD  The SGM48211 operates with a wide supply voltage  range from 8V to 17V for applications such as driving Si  MOSFETs, IGBTs, SiC MOSFETs and GaN FETs. The  maximum voltage on VDD when applied to a  single-ended power, and the differential voltage of the  positive voltage and the negative voltage when applied  to dual-railed power, as well as the bias supply voltage  on the VDD pin should never exceed the values listed  in the Absolute Maximum Ratings section.    Peak Driving Currents  The SGM48211 is designed with 4A peak source and  sink currents for fast switching of power devices. For  example, when the SGM48211 is used to drive an  IPB60R120P7 power MOSFET with a DC bus voltage  of 400V in a continuous conduction mode (CCM) PFC  converter, the turn-on event and the turn-off event are  supposed to be completed in approximately 14ns and  8ns (refer to DS of IPB60R120P7 with typical 36nC of  total QG) separately. Therefore, a source current of  2.57A (= 36nC/14ns) and a sink current of 4.5A (=  36nC/8ns) or higher are necessary. The SGM48211  can provide 4A peak source current and sink currents  larger than the requirements of IPB60R120P7.  In practical designs, the parasitic inductance of PCB  traces will limit the di/dt of the gate driving current that  may not reach the full peak current capability of the  driver. To minimize this impact caused by the parasitic  inductance, it is recommended to place the gate drive  device as close to the power MOSFET as possible and  design a tight gate driving loop with minimum parasitic  inductance.   External gate resistors for turn-on and turn-off of the  MOSFETs should be chosen carefully to achieve  efficiency and EMI optimizations.    Propagation Delay  The SGM48211 features 31ns (TYP) propagation delay  and 3ns (TYP) delay matching between the high-side  and the low-side drivers, which makes it possible for  the device to operate in very high frequency with little  pulse distortion.    Power Dissipation  Power dissipation is the sum of conduction loss and  switching loss as shown in Equation 1.  PDISS = PDC + PSW              (1)  where PDC is the conduction loss and can be calculated  by Equation 2.  PDC = IQ × VDD                        (2)  where  IQ is the total quiescent current consumed by all internal  block circuits and internal parasitic devices during  switching (such as charging and discharging).  VDD is the voltage between the VDD and VSS pins.         120V Boot, 4A Peak, High Frequency  SGM48211  High-side and Low-side Driver      14  APRIL 2024  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued)  PG (PSW) is the switching loss which can be calculated  by Equation 3.  PG = QG × VDD × fSW                (3)  where  fSW is the switching frequency.  QG is the total gate charge of the MOSFET, typical  36nC of IPB60R120P7 in this example.  Half of PG is dissipated during turn-on, and the other  half is dissipated by both the external gate resistors and  the internal resistance of the SGM48211 during  turn-off.  When no external gate resistors are used, PG is  completely dissipated inside the device.  When using external gate resistors, the effective PG_PK  dissipated inside the package can be calculated by  Equation 4.  IN_ON IN_OFF G_PK G IN_ON EX_ON IN_OFF EX_OFF R R 1 P = P ( + ) 2 R +R R +R × ×    (4)  where  RIN_ON is the effective pull-up resistance of the output  stage of SGM48211.  REX_ON is the total external turn-on resistance of gate  resistor and internal gate resistance of the power  MOSFET.  RIN_OFF is the effective pull-down resistance of the  output stage of SGM48211.  REX_OFF is the total external turn-off resistance of gate  resistor and internal gate resistance of the power  MOSFET.    Power Supply Recommendations  The SGM48211 operates in normal mode from the  minimum 8V bias supply governed by the UVLO  function to the maximum 17V bias supply limited by the  20V absolute maximum voltage with a 3V margin to  allow for transient voltage spikes during switching.  UVLO functions are implemented in both VDD and VHB  with a hysteresis function. The voltage thresholds of the  UVLOs are typical 7V on VDD - VSS and 6.4V on VHB -  VHS with respective 0.5V and 1V hysteresis.  To avoid from entering the UVLO mode caused by the  voltage ripple lower than the hysteresis on both VDD  and VHB during switching, local bypass capacitors must  be placed between the VDD and VSS pins and  between the HB and HS pins as close to the device as  possible. Low-ESR, ceramic surface-mount capacitors  with capacitance in the range of 0.22μF to 4.7μF  between VDD and VSS pins and 0.022μF to 0.1μF  between HB and HS pins are recommended.    Layout Guidelines  The following layout recommendations should be  considered:  • Place the SGM48211 as close to the MOSFETs as  possible.  • Locate the bootstrap capacitor (VHB - VHS) and  decoupling capacitor (VDD - VSS) as close to the device  as possible.  • Minimize the gate drive loops from the output pins to  the gate of MOSFETs. Tie the HS and VSS pins  directly to the corresponding source of MOSFETs in  short distance.  • Exposed pad should be connected to VSS net and  with large polygon copper for improved thermal  conduction.  • VDD traces should be away from the high-side pins  and the LO pin.  • A minimum width of 60mils is recommended for the  HO and LO traces.  • Two or more vias should be used if routing through  different layers and for thermal conduction on VSS net.  • Input traces of HI and LI should be away from traces  with higher dV/dt.    Thermal Considerations  Measures that reduce the effective thermal resistances  from the package to PCB or to the open air should be  taken to keep the junction temperature within rated  limits.       120V Boot, 4A Peak, High Frequency  SGM48211  High-side and Low-side Driver      15  APRIL 2024  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  "}'
