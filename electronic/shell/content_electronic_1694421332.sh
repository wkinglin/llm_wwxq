It operates from a 2.7V to 5.5V  supply and the monotonicity is guaranteed by design.   The SGM5355-16 sets the output range by using an  external reference voltage. It incorporates a power-on  reset circuit that ensures the DAC output powers to 0V  and remains powered up at this level until a valid write  takes place. The SGM5355-16 provides a power-down  mode accessed via the serial interface that reduces the  current consumption of the device to 450nA (TYP) at  5.5V. The SGM5355-16 consumes 0.27mW (TYP) at  2.7V in normal mode, which reduces to less than 1μW  in power‑down mode. The low power consumption in  normal mode is very suitable for portable battery-  operated equipment.  The SGM5355-16 uses a versatile 2-wire serial  interface that operates at clock rates to 400kHz and is  compatible with standard I2C interfaces.  The SGM5355-16 is available in Green WLCSP-  0.82×1.22-6B and MSOP-8 packages. It operates over  an ambient temperature range of -40℃ to +125℃.      "}'

ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION  This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are  not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all  integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions.  Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures  can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle  performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision  integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage  because even small parametric changes could cause the  device not to meet the published specifications.

The input  code is straight binary, so the ideal output voltage can be  calculated based on the following equation:    = × IN OUT REF D V V 65536   (1)  Where:   DIN = Equal decimal code that is loaded to the DAC register,  it’s from 0 to 65535.    Power-On Reset  The SGM5355-16 has a power-on reset control circuit. On  power-up, the DAC output voltage is 0V.    Internal Reference  The chip has no internal reference.    Programming  I2C Interface  The SGM5355-16 has a 2-wire (SCL and SDA) I2C  compatible interface. See Figure 1 for a typical operation  sequence.  This section provides a brief example of SGM5355-16  communications. Refer to subsequent sections of this  datasheet for more detailed explanations. Hardware for this  design includes: one SGM5355-16 configured with an I2C  address of 0001111 (WLCSP package chip's address is fixed,  MSOP package chip's address can be configured by ADDR  pin, see Table 1), a microcontroller with an I2C interface,  discrete components such as resistors, capacitors, and serial  connectors, and power supply. Figure 3 shows the basic  hardware configuration.    Table 1.

The configure register allows the user to change  the SGM5355-16 operating modes. Register 0x00, an 8-bit  register, is the operating modes control register, the default  value is 0x00, and more details are shown in Table 2 and  Table 3. Register 0x01, a 16-bit register, is DAC output value  control register, the default value is 0x0000, and more details  are shown in Table 4.

The master provides  clock signal on the SCL pin.   In slave transmit mode, the first byte sent by the master is a  7-bit slave address followed a R/W bit. The second byte is  the point address byte (which is the address of register).  Refer to Table 2 and Table 4. The third and fourth bytes from  the master are the bytes that to be written to the register  addressed in second byte.   Refer to Figure 4 to Figure 7 for read and write operation  demo timing sequences.  All operations must be compatible with I2C protocol, which  need be preceded by a start condition and followed by a stop  condition.         16-Bit, I2C Interface, Voltage-Output  SGM5355-16  Digital-to-Analog Converter      18  SEPTEMBER 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued)  For example, writing to point register 0x00 sets the SGM5355-16 to normal mode, please refer to the following order:  1.
