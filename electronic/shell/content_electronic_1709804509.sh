This device offers small size power solution  for portable equipment. The device has high switching  frequency up to 2.2MHz with resistor programmable.   The SGM6612A has two operation modes, the pulse  width modulation (PWM) mode and pulse frequency  modulation (PFM) mode. The PWM mode is applied at  moderate to heavy load. The PFM mode is applied at  light load to improve the efficiency.   The SGM6612A features a built-in gate driver for  external MOSFET, which can isolate the output from  the input when the device shuts down or in output short  condition. When the output is shorted and the short  protection is triggered, the device goes to the hiccup  mode for safety. In addition, the device also provides  output over-voltage protection, inductor current limit  protection and thermal shutdown.  The SGM6612A is available in a Green TQFN-3×3.5-13L  package.  "}'

It is capable of  delivering up to 10A peak switch current and up to 20V  output voltage. In moderate to heavy load condition, the  SGM6612A works in PWM mode with fixed frequency.  In light load condition, the SGM6612A operates in the  auto PFM mode to improve the efficiency. Excellent line  and load transient response can be achieved with  minimal output capacitance by applying a peak current  control topology. The external loop compensation  makes a wider range of inductor and output capacitor  combinations available.  The SGM6612A supports the resistor-programmable  switching frequency of up to 2.2MHz. In Boost  operation, the device can avoid overload with the  help of peak current control topology. In addition, if the  output current is higher than the short current  threshold or the output voltage is less than the short  voltage threshold, hiccup current protection will be  started in which the regulator remains off for 90ms  before restarting the converter. The device has a gate  driver for external MOSFETs to disconnect the output  from the input side in off-state or output short-circuit  conditions.    Under-Voltage Lockout (UVLO)  An under-voltage lockout circuit prevents operation at  input voltages below 2.5V (TYP) with a hysteresis of  100mV. Therefore, if the input voltage rises and  exceeds 2.6V (TYP), the device restarts.    Enable and Disable  When the input voltage exceeds minimum input voltage  during start-up and the EN voltage is higher than its  logic high threshold, the SGM6612A is enabled. When  the EN voltage is lower than its logic low threshold, the  SGM6612A enters shutdown mode.  Start-up  The SGM6612A implements the soft-start function to  reduce the inrush current during start-up. The device  first charges the output voltage to 1.1 × VIN with the  fixed 500kHz switching frequency during pre-charge  phase. After the precharge phase (2.5ms, TYP), the  output voltage will rise gradually and linearly to the  target value. The soft-start time is 3.2ms (TYP). Then,  the switching frequency is set by the resistor connected  through the FREQ pin.    Load Disconnect Gate Driver  The external MOSFET is driven by the DISDRV pin at  the output to isolate the output from the input in  shutdown or output short-circuit condition. During the  start-up phase, the load disconnect MOSFET is softly  turned on by an internal sink current (55µA, TYP). The  load disconnect MOSFET connection is shown in  Figure 2.    Figure 2. The Load Disconnect MOSFET Configuration  The driver voltage and turn-on/off timing can be set by  the resistor and capacitor which are connected  between DISDRV pin and VOUT pin.

By connecting a resistor to the ILIM pin, the peak  switch current limit can be set. Calculate the correct  resistor value according to Equation 1 as below:  = LIM LIM 730 R I   (1)  where:   RLIM is the resistor used to set the current limit (kΩ).  ILIM is the peak switch current limit (A).  For example, a 50kΩ resistor gives a 14.6A peak  current limit.  Switch current limit and resistor setting of SGM6612A  (Auto PFM) with 7.2V input and 16V output is in Figure  3.      Figure 3. Switch Current Limit vs. Setting Resistor    Adjustable Switching Frequency  The SGM6612A has an adjustable switching frequency  up to 2.2MHz. The switching frequency is set by an  external resistor connected between the FREQ pin and  the AGND. Do not leave the FREQ pin floating. For VIN  close to VOUT applications, it is recommended to  program the switching frequency under 1.1MHz to  avoid triggering device minimum on-time. The resistor  value is calculated by Equations as follows.  = = × × + FREQ FREQ DELAY 1 T k C R t Freq   (2)  = × DELAY FREQ FREQ 1 - t Freq R k C   (3)  where:  tDELAY = 50ns, k = 3, CFREQ = 1.8pF.  For example, when RFREQ is 348kΩ, the frequency is  530kHz.   Switching frequency versus setting resistor please see  Figure 4 (VOUT = 16V and VIN = 7.2V).      Figure 4.

As long as the internal  soft-start voltage is higher than VFB, the low-side switch  is allowed to sink current to have a monotonic start-up  with pre-biased output.    Bootstrap Voltage (BOOT)  A small ceramic capacitor between the BOOT pin and  the SW pin provides gate current to charge the gate of  the high-side MOSFET device during the on-time of  each cycle and to charge the bootstrap capacitor. The  value of this capacitor is recommended to be above  0.1µF.    Device Functional Modes  The synchronous Boost converter SGM6612A operates  at a constant frequency PWM mode in moderate to  heavy load condition. The low-side N-MOSFET switch  is turned on at the start of a cycle, and the inductor  current increases to a peak current determined by the  EA. After the peak current is reached, the current  comparator trips, and it disables the low-side  N-MOSFET switch and the inductor current goes  through the body diode of the high-side N-MOSFET in  a dead-time duration. After the dead-time duration, the  high-side N-MOSFET switch is turned on. Because the  output voltage is larger than the input voltage, the  inductor current decreases. After a short dead-time  duration, the low-side switch is turned on again and the  switching cycle is repeated. To avoid sub-harmonic  oscillation,  the  SGM6612A  has  internal  slope  compensation.  The device features a power-save PFM mode in light  load condition. When the output load is reduced, the  peak current is also decreasing but has a minimum  value. When the load is further reduced and the peak  current is clamped and cannot be reduced further, then  the error amplifier output (COMP pin) will be low  enough to reach the pre-set low threshold and the  device stops switching. In light load condition, the  frequency is reduced depending on the load to  minimize the switching and gate driving losses and  keep the efficiency high.  When VOUT is close to VIN, the Boost converter cannot  support the duty cycle anymore. It enables its built-in  Diode Mode which enables the converter to regulate  the output voltage. When operating in Diode Mode, the  converter's rectifier switch stops switching to regulate  the output voltage. The efficiency during Diode Mode  operation is reduced so that it is recommended that VIN  be at least 1V lower than VOUT.    Hiccup Mode Short Protection (with Load  Disconnect MOSFET)  SGM6612A equips a hiccup protection mode. When the  inductor current reaches the short-circuit protection  limit threshold of 20A (TYP) or the output voltage is less  than 30% of the normal output voltage (TYP), hiccup  protection mode starts. In this mode, the device turns  off for a 90ms (TYP) wait time. After the short-circuit  condition  is  removed,  the  device  recovers  automatically.    Over-Voltage Protection (OVP)  The SGM6612A provides 21V (TYP) OVP threshold.  The device stops switching immediately until the  voltage at the VOUT pin drops 500mV below the  output over-voltage protection threshold. The OVP  circuitry monitors the output voltage (VOUT) and protects  VOUT and SW from exceeding safe operating voltages.    Thermal Shutdown  To prevent thermal damage, the device has an internal  temperature monitor. If the die temperature exceeds  +155℃ (TYP), the device stops switching. Once the  temperature drops below +130℃ (TYP), the device  resumes operation.         20V, 10A Fully-Integrated Synchronous Boost  SGM6612A  Converter with Load Disconnect Control      14  FEBRUARY 2024  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  "}'

For setting a current limit of 13A, the  resistor value is 56kΩ after calculation. Due to the  distribution of the current limit, it is recommended to  select a resistor about 10% less than the calculated  value for safety. Here, 51.1kΩ resistor is a preferable  choice.    Setting the Output Voltage  The output voltage is set by a resistor divider network.  Calculate the output voltage by Equation 4:  UP OUT FB DOWN R V  = V 1   R   × +               (4)  where:   VOUT is the output voltage.   RUP is the top divider resistor.   RDOWN is the bottom divider resistor.  For setting an output voltage of 16V, choose RDOWN to  be about 80.6kΩ, calculated by Equation 4, and RUP is  1MΩ.    Selecting the Output Capacitors  It is recommended to use 3 × 22μF X5R or X7R MLCC  capacitors connected in parallel for most applications.  Refer to Table 3.  With the connection of the load disconnect MOSFET,  the output capacitor should be divided into two parts,  shown in Figure 6. COUT2 should be no greater than 10  × COUT1 to avoid the inrush current when the disconnect  MOSFET is turned on.    Figure 6. Output Capacitor Configuration with Load  Disconnect MOSFET    Selecting the Input Capacitors  A 22μF input capacitor is enough for most applications.  To reduce the input current ripple, larger values may  also be allowed. See Table 3.  Loop Stability and Compensation  Table 4.

When the device shuts down or output shorts,  it disconnects the output from the input, shown in  Figure 7.    Figure 7. Load Disconnect MOSFET Connection  VDS and IDS ratings and safe operating area (SOA)  should be considered when MOSFET is selected.   The drain-to-source voltage rating should be larger  than the maximum output VDS_DIS_MAX = VOUT.   The drain-to-source RMS current rating is the  maximum output current IDS_DIS_RMS = IOUT.   Considering  the  SOA  when  the  output  is  short-circuited, the short protection response time  and surge current can result in heat, SOA > QSHORT.   = × × × SHORT OUT SHORT SHORT 1 Q V I t 2    (5)      RGATE COUT1 CGATE VOUT2 DISDRV VOUT VGS P-MOS COUT2 SGM6612A RGATE COUT1 CGATE VOUT2 DISDRV VOUT VGS P-MOS COUT2 SGM6612A  20V, 10A Fully-Integrated Synchronous Boost  SGM6612A  Converter with Load Disconnect Control      16  FEBRUARY 2024  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued)  where:   VDS_DIS_MAX is the drain-source maximum voltage.   IDS_DIS_RMS is the drain-source RMS current.   ISHORT is the short current.   tSHORT is the response time before the short  protection is triggered.   QSHORT is the heat generated by the output short.  For instance: VOUT = 16V, ISHORT = 20A, tSHORT = 30μs.  SOA ≥ 4.8mJ, VDS_DIS_MAX ≥ 16V.  The CSD25404Q3-20V P-Channel Power MOSFET is  recommended for this design example.  To reduce the turn-on speed, an additional capacitor is  recommended to put between the gate and source of  the external MOSFET.  − − − − × = TH_P MOS GS _P MOS ON_P MOS DIS _P MOS V C t I        (6)  where:   tON_P-MOS is the on-time of external MOSFET.   VTH_P-MOS is the gate threshold of external MOSFET.   CGS_P-MOS is the total gate capacitance between gate  and source of external MOSFET (including the  self-gate-source capacitance of the MOSFET).   IDIS_P-MOS is a typical 55μA discharge current inside  the device.  Given VTH = 1.5V and CGS_P-MOS = 10nF, tON_P-MOS is  about 300μs. It should be noted that the maximum  turn-on time should be no more than 3ms, and the  maximum capacitance CGS_P-MOS should be less than  100nF. That is to say, if the disconnected MOSFET  could not be turned on within the 3ms, the device would  not start up normally.  When selects the gate resistor, the gate-source voltage  of the external MOSFET should be referenced.  − = × GATE GATE DIS _P MOS V R I            (7)  − = GATE GATE DIS _P MOS V R I                (8)  Given the 5V VGATE, the RGATE = 100kΩ.  Selecting the Bootstrap Capacitor  A range of 0.047μF ~ 0.1μF capacitor is recommended for  bootstrap capacitor. And 0.1μF is used in this design.  Refer to Table 3.    VCC Capacitor  The value of VCC capacitor should be at least 10 times  larger than the value of CBOOT. A 1μF ~ 2.2μF capacitor  value range is recommended for VCC capacitor. A value  of 2.2μF is recommended in this example, please see  Table 3.    Layout Guidelines  As for all switching power supplies, especially those  high frequency and high current ones, layout is an  important design step. Poor layout could result in  system instability, EMI failure, and device damage.  Therefore, use wide and short traces for high current  paths. Thus, place input capacitor as close to the VIN  pin and GND pin as possible. If possible, choose higher  capacitance value for CIN. The SW pin carries high  current with fast rising and falling edges, therefore, all  connections to the SW pin should be kept as short and  wide as possible. The output capacitor COUT should be  put close to VOUT. It is also beneficial to have the  ground of COUT close to the GND pin since there is large  ground return current flowing between them. Sensitive  signals like FB, COMP traces must be placed away  from SW trace. The ground of these signals should be  connected to GND pin and separated with power  ground.       20V, 10A Fully-Integrated Synchronous Boost  SGM6612A  Converter with Load Disconnect Control      17  FEBRUARY 2024  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued)  System Examples  SGM6612A (14V Output, 2.7V to 4.4V Input)  The schematic of a typical application circuit that is used for 14V output voltage from 2.7V to 4.4V input voltage of  SGM6612A is given in Figure 8.
