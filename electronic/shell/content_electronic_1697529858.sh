A low RDSON  N-MOSFET is integrated as high-side switch. The  quiescent current is as low as 148μA. The shutdown  current drops to 2.6μA during shutdown (EN = low). The  internal under-voltage lockout (UVLO) threshold is 4.2V  and can be adjusted (increased) by an external resistor  divider. An internal soft-start circuit controls the output  voltage start-up ramp. Switching frequency can be  selected over a wide range (100kHz to 2500kHz) to  allow desired tradeoff among efficiency, component  sizes and conversion voltage ratio. Protection against  over-voltage transient is provided to limit the startup or  other transient overshoots. Secure operation in  overload conditions is ensured by cycle-by-cycle  current limit, frequency fold-back and thermal shutdown  protection.   The SGM61433 is available in a Green SOIC-8  (Exposed Pad) package.    "}'

Using peak current mode control and  operating at fixed PWM frequency, this device provides  good line and load transient responses with reduced  output capacitance.  The minimum operating input voltage of the device is  4.5V. The output voltage can be set down to 0.8V  (reference voltage). The quiescent current is 148μA  and shutdown current drops to 2.6μA during shutdown  (EN = low). The low RDSON (68mΩ) high-side switch  allows high operating efficiency.  The EN pin is internally pulled up by a current source  that can keep the device enable if EN is floating. It can  also be used to increase the input UVLO threshold  using a resistor divider.   This device can operate with duty cycles close to 100%  using the automated internal CBOOT recharge circuit.  This feature allows setting the VOUT very close to the  VIN.  The internal phase-locked loop (PLL) synchronizes to  the RT/CLK pin so that the high-side switch turn-on  time is synchronized to the input clock falling edges.  Over-voltage protection (OVP) circuit is designed to  minimum the output over-voltage transients. When this  comparator detects an OVP (VFB > 109% × VREF), the  switch is kept off until the output falls below 106% of the  VREF.  The output voltage ramps up slowly during start-up with  slow increasing of the PWM reference voltage by the  integrated soft-start circuit. Soft-start is necessary to  limit the inrush current, output voltage overshoot and to  avoid potential over-current hiccups during power-up.  Any recovery from shutdown state begins with a soft-start.  Light load efficiency is enhanced by a special power-save  mode that is activated when the peak inductor current  falls below 670mA (TYP).  During startup and over-current, the frequency is reduced  (frequency fold-back) to allow easy maintenance of low  inductor current. The thermal shutdown provides an  additional protection in fault conditions.    Minimum Input Voltage (4.5V) and UVLO  The recommended minimum operating input voltage is  4.5V. The device may operate with lower voltages that  are above the input UVLO threshold (4.2V TYP). If VIN  falls below its falling UVLO threshold, the device will  stop switching.    Enable Input and UVLO Adjustment  The device will be enabled if VIN exceeds 4.2V and EN  voltage is above 1.18V. The device will be disabled if  the EN voltage is externally pulled low or the VIN pin  voltage falls below its UVLO threshold. When the EN  pin is floating, an internal pull-up current source keeps  the EN pin voltage at high state that enables the  device.  If an application requires a higher input UVLO threshold,  an external input UVLO adjustment circuit (resistor  divider) is recommended in Figure 3. Figure 3 shows  how UVLO and hysteresis are increased using REN1  and REN2. A 3.5μA additional current is injected to the  divider when EN pin voltage exceeds 1.18V to provide  hysteresis. When the EN pin voltage falls below 1.18V,  the 3.5μA additional current is removed. Use Equations  1 and 2 to calculate these resistors. VSTART is the input  start (turn-on) threshold voltage and VSTOP is the input  stop (turn-off) threshold voltage.  = START STOP EN1 V - V R 3.5μA                   (1)  EN EN2 START EN EN1 V R = V -V +1.3 R μA               (2)  EN 1.3µA 3.5µA 1.18V VIN REN1 REN2 +     Figure 3.

There is an internal bias  voltage (0.5V TYP) on the RT/CLK pin during the RT  mode and must have a resistor to ground to set the  switching frequency. Use Equation 3 to find the RT  resistance for any desired switching frequency (fSW).  ( ) ( ) = SW 0.985 T 92417 f kHz R kΩ              (3)    Synchronization to RT/CLK Pin  The internal oscillator can synchronize to an external  logic clock source applied to the RT/CLK pin (see  Figure 4) in the 160kHz to 2300kHz range. The SW  rising edge (high-side switch turn-on) is synchronized  to the external logic clock falling edge. The external  logic clock low and high levels must be less than 0.9V  and more than 1.9V and have a pulse width larger than  15ns. So, when the external logic clock source is off,  the DC resistance (RT) between RT/CLK pin and GND  determines the default switching frequency (fCLK).   SGM61433 RT/CLK RT Logic Clock Source     Figure 4. Synchronization to External Clock    Low Dropout Operation and Bootstrap  Voltage (BOOT Pin)  An internal regulator provides the bias voltage for gate  driver using a 0.1μF ceramic capacitor. X5R or better  dielectric types are recommended. The BOOT capacitor  is refreshed when the high-side switch is off and the  external low-side diode conducts.  The SGM61433 operates at maximum duty cycle when  input voltage is closed to output voltage as long as the  bootstrap voltage (VBOOT - VSW) is greater than its UVLO  threshold (2.6V). If the bootstrap voltage drops below  2.1V, the high-side switch will be temporarily turned off  and an integrated small MOSFET at low-side will pull  the SW voltage low to recharge CBOOT. After the  recharge, the high-side switch is turned on again to  regulate the output. To reduce the losses of the  integrated small low-side MOSFET at high output  voltages, the function of CBOOT refreshed  is disabled  when output voltage is over 24V and re-enabled when  output voltage reaches 21.5V.  Because the small gate current sourced from CBOOT,  the high-side switch can remain on for many switching  cycles before the switch is turned off to recharge the  CBOOT. Thus, this will effectively increase the SGM61433  switching duty cycle, approaching 100%.    Internal Soft-Start  During each startup, a digital soft-start gradually ramps  the regulation reference from 0V to 0.8V in 1365 switching  cycles. The soft-start time is given in Equation 4.  ( ) ( ) = SS SW 1365 t ms f kHz                  (4)  Each time the SGM61433 is disabled, for example after  a thermal shutdown or when the EN voltage falls below  1.18V, the device stops switching and resets the soft-start  timer.    Error Amplifier (EA)  This SGM61433 uses a transconductance amplifier to  compare the sensed output voltage (VFB) and the  internal reference as error amplifier (EA). The gain of  EA amplifier in normal operation is 407μA/V. The output  current is injected into the frequency compensation  network (between COMP and GND pins) to produce  the control signal (VCOMP) for the PWM comparator.         SGM61433  4.5V to 42V Input, 3.5A Buck Converter      13  FEBRUARY 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued)  Slope Compensation  Without implementing some slope compensation, the  PWM pulse widths will be unstable and oscillatory at  duty cycles above 50%. To avoid sub-harmonic oscillations  in this device, an internal compensation ramp is added  to the measured high-side switch current before  comparing it with the control signal by the PWM  comparator.    Power-Save Mode  To reduce light load loss and increase the efficiency,  power-save mode (PSM) feature is included in the  SGM61433. When the peak inductor current is below  PSM current threshold, the corresponding COMP pin  voltage (VCOMP) will be lower than 600mV. The device  will enter PSM in such conditions.  In PSM, VCOMP is internally clamped at 600mV that  inhibits the high-side MOSFET switching. The device  can exit PSM if VCOMP rises above the clamp level and  the peak inductor current exceeds current threshold.  During PSM operation, the peak inductor current is the  sensed parameter for entering the PSM, the actual load  current (DC) threshold for PSM will depend on the  output filter.    Over-Current and Frequency Fold-Back  Protections  Over-current protection (OCP) is naturally provided by  current mode control. In each cycle, the high-side  current sensing starts a short time (blanking time) after  the high-side switch is turned on. The sensed high-side  switch current is continuously compared with the  current limit threshold and when the high-side current  reaches to that threshold, the high-side switch is turned  off. If the output is overloaded, VOUT drops and VCOMP is  increased by EA to compensate that. However, the EA  output (VCOMP) is clamped to a maximum value. By  limiting the VCOMP (maximum peak current), the output  current can actually be limited precisely.  The natural OCP of the peak current mode control may  not be able to provide a complete protection when an  output short-circuit occurs and an extra protection  mechanism for short-circuit is needed. In a short-circuit  event, the inductor current can significantly exceed the  peak current limit threshold at high input voltage  because the switch cannot be turned off as fast as  needed due to the limited minimum on-time. During the  output short, the inductor current decreases slowly  because a small negative diode forward voltage  appears across the inductor during the off-time, as a  result the inductor current cannot be reset. In these  conditions, current can saturate the inductor and the  current may even increase higher until the device is  damaged. In the SGM61433, this problem is effectively  solved by increasing the off-time during short-circuit by  reducing the switching frequency (frequency fold-back).  As the output voltage drops and the FB pin voltage falls  from 0.8V to 0V, the frequency will be divided by 1, 2, 4  and 8.    Over-Voltage Protection  When an overload or an output fault condition is  removed, large overshoots may occur on the output.  The SGM61433 includes over-voltage protection (OVP)  circuit to reduce such over-voltage transients. If the FB  pin voltage exceeds 109% of the VREF threshold, the  high-side MOSFET is turned off. When it returns below  106% of the VREF threshold, the high-side MOSFET is  released again.    Thermal Shutdown (TSD)  If the junction temperature (TJ) exceeds +176℃, the  TSD protection circuit will stop switching to protect the  device from overheating. The device will automatically  restart with a power-up sequence when the junction  temperature drops below +156℃.

Higher frequency  increases the switching and gate charge losses. Lower  frequency requires larger inductance and capacitances,  and results in larger overall physical size and higher  cost. Therefore, a tradeoff is needed between losses  and  component  size.  If  the  application  is  noise-sensitive to a frequency range, the frequency  should be selected out of that range.  For this design, a lower switching frequency of 420kHz  is chosen and a 243kΩ resistor can be chosen for R4  according to Equation 3.    Input Capacitor Design  A high-quality ceramic capacitor (X5R or X7R or better  dielectric grade) must be used for input decoupling of  the SGM61433. At least 3μF of effective capacitance  (after deratings) is needed on the VIN input. In some  applications additional bulk capacitance may also be  required for the VIN input, for example, when the  SGM61433 is more than 5cm away from the input  source. The VIN capacitor ripple current rating must  also be greater than the maximum input current ripple.  The input current ripple can be calculated using  Equation 5 and the maximum value occurs at 50% duty  cycle. Using the design example values, IOUT = 3.5A,  yields an RMS input ripple current of 1.75A.

The input capacitance determines the  regulator input voltage ripple. This ripple can be  calculated from Equation 6. In this example, the total  effective capacitance of the four 4.7µF/50V capacitors  is around 18.8µF at 12V input, and the input voltage  ripple is 88.4mV.  × × − = × OUT IN IN SW I D (1 D) ΔV C f                (6)  It is recommended to place an additional small size  0.22μF ceramic capacitor right beside VIN and GND  pins (anode of the diode) for high frequency filtering.    Inductor Design  Equation 7 is conventionally used to calculate the  output inductance of a Buck converter. Generally, a  smaller inductor is preferred to allow larger bandwidth  and smaller size. The ratio of inductor current ripple (∆IL)  to the maximum output current (IOUT) is represented as  KIND factor (∆IL/IOUT). The inductor ripple current is  bypassed and filtered by the output capacitor and the  inductor DC current is passed to the output. Inductor  ripple is selected based on a few considerations. The  peak inductor current (IOUT + ∆IL/2) must have a safe  margin from the saturation current of the inductor in the  worst-case conditions especially if a hard-saturation  core type inductor (such as ferrite) is chosen. For peak  current mode converter, selecting an inductor with  saturation current above the switch current limit is  sufficient. The ripple current also affects the selection of  the output capacitor. COUT RMS current rating must be  higher than the inductor RMS ripple. Typically, a 20% to  40% ripple is selected (KIND = 0.2 ~ 0.4). Choosing a  higher KIND value reduces the selected inductance, but  a too high KIND factor may result in insufficient slope  compensation.  = × × × IN_MAX OUT OUT OUT IND IN_MAX SW V - V V L I K V f        (7)  KIND = 0.3 is a suitable choice when low-ESR ceramic  capacitors are used for output capacitors. KIND = 0.2 is  preferred when a high-ESR output capacitor is used. In  this example, the calculated inductance will be 5.2μH  with KIND = 0.4, so the nearest larger inductance of  5.5μH is selected. The ripple, RMS and peak inductor  current calculations are summarized in Equations 8, 9  and 10 respectively.  = × × IN_MAX OUT OUT L IN_MAX SW V - V V ΔI L V f        (8)  = + 2 2 L L _RMS OUT ΔI I I 12                (9)  = + L L _PEAK OUT ΔI I I 2               (10)  Note that during startup, load transients or fault  conditions, the peak inductor current may exceed the  calculated IL_PEAK. Therefore it is always safer to choose  the inductor saturation current higher than the switch  current limit.    External Diode   An external power diode between the SW and GND  pins is needed by the SGM61433 to complete the  converter. This diode must tolerate the application’s  absolute maximum ratings. The reverse blocking  voltage must be higher than VIN_MAX and its peak  current must be above the maximum inductor current.  Choose a diode with small forward voltage drop for  higher efficiency. Typically, diodes with higher voltage  and current ratings have higher forward voltages. A  diode with a minimum of 42V reverse voltage is  preferred to allow input voltage transients up to the  rated voltage of the SGM61433.           SGM61433  4.5V to 42V Input, 3.5A Buck Converter      16  FEBRUARY 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued)  Output Capacitor  Three primary criteria must be considered for design of  the output capacitor (COUT):   1. The converter pole location.  2. The output voltage ripple.  3. The transient response to a large change in load  current.  The selected value must satisfy all of them. The desired  transient response is usually expressed as maximum  overshoot, maximum undershoot, or maximum recovery  time of VOUT in response to a large load step. Transient  response is usually the more stringent criteria in low  output voltage applications. The output capacitor must  provide the increased load current or absorb the excess  inductor current (when the load current steps down)  until the control loop can re-adjust the current of the  inductor to the new load level. Typically, it requires two  or more cycles for the loop to detect the output change  and respond (change the duty cycle). Another  requirement may also be expressed as desired hold-up  time in which the output capacitor must hold the output  voltage above a certain level for a specified period if the  input power is removed. It may also be expressed as  the maximum output voltage drop or rise when the full  load is connected or disconnected (100% load step).  Equation 11 can be used to calculate the minimum  output capacitance that is needed to supply a current  step (ΔIOUT) for at least 2 cycles until the control loop  responds to the load change with a maximum allowed  output transient of ΔVOUT (overshoot or undershoot).  × > × OUT OUT SW OUT 2 ΔI C f ΔV              (11)  where:  ΔIOUT is the change in output current.  ΔVOUT is the allowable change in the output voltage.  For example, if the acceptable transient from 0.875A to  2.625A load step is 4%, by inserting ΔVOUT = 0.04 ×  3.3V = 0.132V and ΔIOUT = 1.75A, the minimum  required capacitance will be 63μF. Note that the impact  of output capacitor ESR on the transient is not taken  into account in Equation 11. For ceramic capacitors, the  ESR is generally small enough to ignore its impact on  the calculation of ΔVOUT transient. However, for  aluminum electrolytic and tantalum capacitors, or high  current power supplies, the ESR contribution to ΔVOUT  must be considered.  When the load steps down, the excess inductor current  will charge the capacitor and the output voltage will  overshoot. The catch diode current cannot discharge  COUT, so COUT must be large enough as given in  Equation 12 to absorb the excess inductor energy with  limited over-voltage. The excess energy absorbed in the  output capacitor increases the voltage on the capacitor.  The capacitor must be sized to maintain the desired  output voltage during these transient periods. Equation  12 calculates the minimum capacitance required to keep  the output-voltage overshoot to a desired value.  > × + − 2 2 OUT _H OUT _L OUT 2 2 OUT OUT OUT I -I C L (V Δ V ) V         (12)  where:  IOUT_H is the high level of the current step.

For example, if the acceptable transient from 2.625A  to 0.875A load step is 4%, by inserting ΔVOUT = 0.04 ×  3.3V = 0.132V, the minimum required capacitance will  be 38μF.  Equation 13 can be used for the output ripple criteria  and finding the minimum output capacitance needed.  VOUT_RIPPLE is the maximum acceptable ripple.

In this example, 2 × 100μF/10V X5R  ceramic capacitors with 2mΩ of ESR are used. The  amount of ripple current that a capacitor can handle  without damage or overheating is limited.

A 5Ω to 10Ω resistor (R5) can be added  in series with C8 to slow down switch-on speed of the  high-side switch and reduce EMI if needed. Too high  values for R5 may cause insufficient C8 charging in high  duty-cycle applications. Slower switch-on speed will  also increase switch losses and reduce efficiency.    UVLO Setting  The input UVLO can be programmed using an external  voltage divider on the EN pin of the device. In this  example R1 is connected between VIN pin and EN pin  and R2 is connected between EN and GND (see Figure  5). The turn-on (enable to start switching) occurs when  VIN rises above 5.55V (UVLO rising threshold). When  the regulator is working, it will not stop switching  (disabled) until the input falls below 4.27V (UVLO  falling threshold). Equations 1 and 2 are provided to  calculate the resistors. For this example, the nearest  standard resistor values are R1 = 365kΩ and R2 =  88.7kΩ.    Feedback Resistors Setting  Use an external resistor divider (R6 and R7) to set the  output voltage using Equations 16 and 17.    − = ×    OUT REF 6 7 REF V V R R V                 (16)    = × +     6 OUT REF 7 R V V 1 R                  (17)  In this example by selecting R7 = 10.2kΩ for the lower  resistor, the calculated R6 value will be 31.9kΩ and a  31.6kΩ resistor is selected as the nearest standard 1%  resistor.    Compensation Network Setting  Several techniques are used by engineers to compensate  a DC/DC regulator. The method presented here uses  simple calculations and generally results in high phase  margins. In most conditions, the phase margin will be  between 60 and 90 degrees. In this method the effects  of the slope compensation are ignored. Because of this  approximation, the actual cross over frequency is  usually lower than the calculated value.  First, the converter pole (fP) and ESR-zero (fZ) are  calculated from Equations 18 and 19. For COUT, the  worst derated value of 130μF should be used.  Equations 20 and 21 can be used to find an estimation  for closed-loop crossover frequency (fCO) as a starting  point.  = × × × OUT P OUT OUT I f 2 π V C               (18)  = × × × Z ESR OUT 1 f 2 π R C               (19)  = × co P Z f f f                     (20)  = × SW co P f f f 2                    (21)  For this design, fP = 1.29kHz and fZ = 610kHz. Equation  20 yields 28kHz and Equation 21 gives 16.5kHz. Use  the geometric mean value of Equation 20 and Equation  21 for an initial crossover frequency. In this application  example, the lab experiments shows that to achieve the  required transient response the crossover frequency  must be at least fCO = 30kHz. Having the crossover  frequency, the compensation network (R3 and C6) can  be calculated.

A weak layout can result in poor performance, resistive  losses, EMI issues and instability problems. The  following guidelines are helpful for designing a good  layout for the SGM61433.    Bypass the VIN pin to GND pin (where it connects  to the anode pin of the power diode) with low-ESR  ceramic capacitors and place them as close as  possible to the device.   Connect the diode as close as possible to SW and  GND pins.   Share the same GND connection point with the  input and output capacitors.   Connect the device GND to the PCB ground plane  right at the GND pin.   Stitch the exposed pad to the internal ground  planes and the back side of the PCB directly under  the IC using multiple thermal vias.   Minimize the length and the area of the connection  route from SW pin to the cathode of the diode and  the inductor to reduce the noise coupling from this  area.   Minimize FB trace length and keep both feedback  resistors close to the FB pin. Bring the VOUT sense  trace from the point where VOUT accuracy is  important and keep it away from the noisy nodes  (SW), preferably through another layer that is on  the other side of a shield layer.    Place the RT resistor as close as possible to the  RT/CLK pin with short routes.   Choose wide traces for VIN, VOUT and ground to  minimize voltage drops and maximize efficiency.   For operation at full-rated load, the top side ground  area must provide adequate heat dissipating area.
