An internal charge pump generates the necessary  gate-drive voltage. The SGM42500 operates from 7V to  40V motor power supply, which can supply a 3.6A peak  current. Full protection features include over-current  protection, under-voltage lockout and over-temperature  protection.    Standby Mode  For SGM42500, if both input pins (IN1/IN2) are low for  longer than 1ms, the device will go to standby mode. If  entering the standby mode, the output MOSFET,  charge pump, and regulator are turned off for saving  power.    Internal PWM Current Control  The current in the output is limited using fixed off-time  control circuitry. If the motor current goes over the  current limit setting, the two low-side MOSFETs are  both turned on for tOFF time, slow decay mode is used  to adjust the current.    VREF  The current limit is decided by VREF and RS together,  please refer to Equation 1:  REF TRIPMAX S V I =10 R ×                   (1)    Over-Current Protection (OCP)  Each MOSFET is protected by its own preset  over-current limit. In case of an over-current (any  direction), the whole bridge will be disabled (shutdown),  and the device will retry after tRETRY. An over-current will  occur due to a short between a switching node and  ground, VM supply line, or the other node of the bridge  (a winding short).    Under-Voltage Lockout (UVLO)  If the voltage on VM pin falls below its under-voltage  lockout threshold, the device will be disabled. The  device resumes operation when the power supply goes  back above UVLO thresholds.    Thermal Shutdown (TSD)  The driver is shutdown if a junction over-temperature  occurs in the device. Once the temperature goes back  to the safe level, the device resumes its operation.

In order to detect the output  current, the ground trace IR drop should be minimized.  Surface mounted and low inductance sense resistor is  recommended. It is necessary to consider the package,  since I2 × R heat is generated in the sense resistor. And  during PCB layout, place the resistor near to the motor  driver as close as possible.  Ensure that the maximum voltage of LSS (±500mV) is  not exceeded at the maximum load, and select the  appropriate resistance value. This rating may be  exceeded for a short time during an over-current event.      Ground and Layout Guidelines  The power supply VM is suggested to be decoupled  with a bulk capacitor in parallel with a lower value  ceramic capacitor placed as close as practicable to the  device.   The exposed pad on the bottom of the device provides  a path for heat dissipation. The pad should be soldered  directly to an exposed surface on the PCB board to  achieve better thermal performance. Thermal vias are  also helpful to dissipate the heat.  It is good to have a low impedance single-point ground,  known as a star ground, which is located close to the  SGM42500. The copper ground plane located under  the device thermal pad is typically used as the star  ground.                                                    "}'
