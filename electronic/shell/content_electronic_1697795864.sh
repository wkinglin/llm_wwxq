Using peak current mode control and  operating at fixed PWM frequency, this device provides  good line and load transient responses with reduced  output capacitance and simple compensation.  The minimum operating input voltage of the device is  4V and its nominal frequency is 540kHz. The output  voltage can be set down to 0.8V (reference voltage).  Typical no-load operating current is 120μA. It reduces  to 1.2μA if the device is disabled. The low RDSON  high-side  switch  (77mΩ)  allows  high  operating  efficiency.  The EN pin is internally pulled up by a current source  that can keep the device enable if EN is floating. It can  also be used to increase the input UVLO threshold  using a resistor divider.  The bootstrap diode is integrated and only a small  capacitor between BOOT and SW pins (CBOOT) is  needed for the MOSFET gate driving bias. A separate  UVLO circuit monitors CBOOT voltage and turns the  switch off if this voltage falls below a preset threshold.  The SS pin internal current source allows soft-start time  adjustments with a small external capacitor. This  feature provides more flexibility in output filter design.  Light load efficiency is enhanced by a special  pulse-skip mode that is activated when the peak  inductor current falls below 340mA (TYP).  During startup and over-current, the frequency is  reduced  (frequency  fold-back)  to  allow  easy  maintenance of low inductor current. The thermal  shutdown provides an additional protection in fault  conditions.  Minimum Input Voltage (4V) and UVLO  The recommended minimum operating input voltage is  4V, however, the actual UVLO threshold can be less  than this value and the device may operate at voltages  below 4V. The UVLO threshold is not specified. If VIN  falls below UVLO voltage, the device will stop switching.  If the EN pin is left floating or pulled high and VIN  exceeds the UVLO threshold, the device will start up  with a soft-start.  Enable Input and UVLO Adjustment  An internal current source pull-up keeps the EN pin  voltage at high state by default. The device will disable  if the EN voltage is externally pulled low. It will also  disable if VIN pin voltage falls below its under-voltage  lockout threshold. If VIN minimum range is less than  VOUT + 2V, an external VIN UVLO adjustment (resistor  divider in Figure 3) is recommended to increase the  VIN turn-on threshold and add hysteresis to UVLO  comparator. Figure 3 shows how UVLO and hysteresis  are increased using REN1 and REN2. A 3.7μA additional  current is injected to the divider when EN voltage  exceeds VEN = 1.25V to provide hysteresis. Use  Equations 1 and 2 to calculate these resistors. VSTART is  the input start (turn-on) threshold voltage and VSTOP is  the input stop (turn-off) threshold voltage. The selected  VSTOP threshold must be higher than 4V.  − START STOP EN1 V V R  =  3.7μA                       (1)  − + EN EN2 START EN EN1 V R  = V V 0.8μA R               (2)  REN1 REN2 VIN EN 1.25V + - 0.8μA 3.7μA   Figure 3. VIN UVLO Adjustment  Bootstrap Gate Driving (BOOT)  An internal regulator provides the bias voltage for gate  driver using a 0.1μF ceramic capacitor. A ceramic  capacitor with X5R or better grade dielectric is  recommended. The capacitor must have a 10V or  higher voltage rating. The BOOT capacitor is refreshed  when the high-side MOSFET is off and the external  low-side diode conducts.         SGM61232  28V, 3A, Buck DC/DC Converter      7  OCTOBER 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued)  SS Pin and Soft-Start Adjustment  It is recommended to add a soft-start capacitor (CSS)  between SS pin and GND to set the soft-start time from  1ms to 10ms for a proper startup. The lower of the SS  pin voltage VSS and VREF is applied to the error amplifier  to regulate the output. The internal ISS = 2μA current  charges CSS and provides a linear voltage ramp on the  SS pin. Use Equation 3 to calculate the soft-start time  (10% to 90% rise). It is recommended that CSS be less  than 27nF.  × SS REF SS SS C  (nF) V  (V) t  (ms) =  I  (μA)                 (3)  Error Amplifier (EA)  This device uses a trans-conductance amplifier to  compare the sensed output voltage (VSENSE) and the  internal reference as error amplifier (EA). The gain of  EA amplifier in normal operation is 131μA/V. The output  current is injected into the frequency compensation  network (between COMP and GND pins) to produce  the control signal (VC) for the PWM comparator.  Slope Compensation  Without implementing some slope compensation, the  PWM pulse widths will be unstable and oscillatory at  duty cycles above 50%. To avoid sub-harmonic  oscillations in this device, an internal compensation  ramp is added to the measured switch current before  comparing it with the control signal by the PWM  comparator.  Power-Save Mode  To reduce light load loss and increase the efficiency,  pulse-skip mode (PSM) feature is included in the  SGM61232. When the peak inductor current is below  340mA (TYP), the COMP pin voltage (VC) will be lower  than 0.5V (TYP). The device will enter power-save  mode in such conditions. In this mode, VC is internally  clamped at 0.5V that inhibits the MOSFET switching.  The device can exit PSM if VC rises above the clamp  level and the peak inductor current exceeds 340mA.  Since the peak inductor current is the sensed  parameter for entering the PSM, the actual load current  (DC) threshold for PSM will depend on the output filter.  Over-Current Protection and Frequency  Fold-back  Over-current protection (OCP) is naturally provided by  current mode control. In each cycle, the high-side (HS)  current sensing starts a short time (blanking time) after  the HS switch is turned on. The sensed HS switch  current is continuously compared with the current limit  threshold and when the HS current reaches to that  threshold, the HS switch is turned off.  The natural OCP of the peak current mode control may  not be able to provide a complete protection when an  output short-circuit occurs and an extra protection  mechanism for short-circuit is needed. During an output  short, inductor current may runaway above over-  current limits. Current runaway can saturate the  inductor and the current may even increase higher until  the device is damaged. This is because the inductor  current cannot be reset (volt-second balance) during  the off-time. During the output short, only a small  negative diode forward voltage appears across the  inductor during the off-time. Note that the minimum  on-time is limited, and in each cycle, all input voltage  appears on the inductor during the minimum on-time.  The circuit delays and reaction time makes these  conditions even worse, and in each cycle, the current is  increased to a new higher level. In the SGM61232, this  problem is effectively solved by increasing the off-time  during short-circuit by reducing the switching frequency  (frequency fold-back). As the output voltage drops and  VSENSE voltage falls from 0.8V to 0V, the frequency  will be divided by 1, 2, 4, and 8 depending on the drop  as shown in Table 1.  Table 1. Frequency Fold-Back with VOUT Drop  Switching Frequency  VSENSE Pin Voltage  540kHz  VSENSE ≥ 0.6V  540kHz / 2  0.6V > VSENSE ≥ 0.4V  540kHz / 4  0.4V > VSENSE ≥ 0.2V  540kHz / 8  0.2V > VSENSE    Over-Voltage Transient Protection  When an overload or an output fault condition is  removed, large overshoots may occur on the output.  The SGM61232 includes a protection circuit to reduce  such over-voltage transients. If VSENSE voltage  exceeds 109% of the VREF threshold, the MOSFET is  turned off. When it returns below 107% of the VREF, the  MOSFET is released again.  Thermal Shutdown (TSD)  If the junction temperature (TJ) exceeds +165℃, the  TSD protection circuit will stop switching to protect the  device from overheating. The device will automatically  restart with a power up sequence when the die  temperature drops below +140℃.

In some  applications, additional bulk capacitance may also be  required for the VIN input, for example, when the  SGM61232 is more than 5cm away from the input  source. The VIN capacitor ripple current rating must  also be greater than the maximum input current ripple.  The input current ripple can be calculated using  Equation 4 and the maximum value occurs at 50% duty  cycle. Using the design example values, IOUT = 3A,  yields an RMS input ripple current of 1.5A.

So, two 4.7µF/50V capacitors in parallel are  selected for VIN to cover all DC bias, thermal and aging  deratings. The input capacitance determines the  regulator input voltage ripple. This ripple can be  calculated from Equation 5.

Generally, a  smaller inductor is preferred to allow larger bandwidth  and smaller size. The ratio of inductor current ripple (∆IL)  to the maximum output current (IOUT) is represented as  KIND factor (∆IL/IOUT). The inductor ripple current is  bypassed and filtered by the output capacitor, and the  inductor DC current is passed to the output. Inductor  ripple is selected based on a few considerations. The  peak inductor current (IOUT + ∆IL/2) must have a safe  margin from the saturation current of the inductor in the  worst-case conditions especially if a hard-saturation  core type inductor (such as ferrite) is chosen. For peak  current mode converter, selecting an inductor with  saturation current above the switch current limit is  sufficient. The ripple current also affects the selection  of the output capacitor. COUT RMS current rating must  be higher than the inductor RMS ripple. Typically, a 20%  to 40% ripple is selected (KIND = 0.2 ~ 0.4). Choosing a  higher KIND value reduces the selected inductance, but  a too high KIND factor may result in insufficient slope  compensation.  − × × × IN_MAX OUT OUT OUT IND IN_MAX SW V V V L =  I K V f         (6)  KIND = 0.3 is a suitable choice when low-ESR ceramic  capacitors are used for output capacitors. KIND = 0.2 is  preferred when a high-ESR output capacitor is used. In  this example, the calculated inductance will be 6μH  with KIND = 0.3, so the nearest larger inductance of  6.8μH is selected. The ripple, RMS and peak inductors  current calculations are summarized in Equations 7, 8  and 9 respectively.  − ∆ × × IN_MAX OUT OUT L IN_MAX SW V V V I  =  L V f          (7)  ∆ + 2 2 L L_RMS OUT I I  = I 12                      (8)  ∆ + L L_PEAK OUT I I  = I 2                       (9)  The current flowing through the inductor is the inductor  ripple current plus the output current. During power-up,  faults or transient load conditions, the inductor current  can increase above the calculated peak inductor  current level calculated above. In transient conditions,  the inductor current can increase up to the switch  current limit of the device. For this reason, the most  conservative approach is to specify an inductor with a  saturation current rating equal to or greater than the  switch current limit rather than the peak inductor  current.  External Diode (Catch Diode)  An external power diode between the SW and GND  pins is needed for the SGM61232 to complete the  converter. This diode must tolerate the application’s  absolute maximum ratings. The reverse blocking  voltage must be higher than VIN_MAX and its peak  current must be above the maximum inductor current.  Choose a diode with small forward voltage drop for  higher efficiency. Typically, diodes with higher voltage  and current ratings have higher forward voltages. A  diode with a minimum of 30V reverse voltage is  preferred to allow input voltage transients up to the  rated voltage of the SGM61232.  Output Capacitor Design  Three primary criteria must be considered for design of  the output capacitor (COUT): (1) the converter pole  location, (2) the output voltage ripple, (3) the transient  response to a large change in load current. The  selected value must satisfy all of them. The desired  transient response is usually expressed as maximum  overshoot,  maximum  undershoot,  or  maximum  recovery time of VOUT in response to a large load step.  Transient response is usually the more stringent criteria  in low output voltage applications. The output capacitor  must provide the increased load current or absorb the  excess inductor current (when the load current steps  down) until the control loop can re-adjust the current of  the inductor to the new load level. Typically, it requires  two or more cycles for the loop to detect the output  change and respond (change the duty cycle). Another  requirement may also be expressed as desired hold-up  time in which the output capacitor must hold the output  voltage above a certain level for a specified period if the  input power is removed. It may also be expressed as  the maximum output voltage drop or rise when the full  load is connected or disconnected (100% load step).  Equation 10 can be used to calculate the minimum  output capacitance that is needed to supply a current  step (ΔIOUT) for at least 2 cycles until the control loop  responds to the load change with a maximum allowed  output transient of ΔVOUT (overshoot or undershoot).

For example, if the acceptable transient from 1.5A to  3A load step is 5%, by inserting ΔVOUT = 0.05 × 3.3V =  0.165V and ΔIOUT = 1.5A, the minimum required  capacitance will be 33.7μF. Note that the impact of  output capacitor ESR on the transient is not taken into  account in Equation 10. For ceramic capacitors, the  ESR is generally small enough to ignore its impact on  the calculation of ΔVOUT transient.  The output capacitor must also be sized to absorb  energy stored in the inductor when transitioning from a  high to low load current. The energy stored in the  inductor can produce an output voltage overshoot when  the load current decreases rapidly. The excess energy  absorbed in the output capacitor increases the voltage  on the capacitor. The capacitor must be sized to  maintain the desired output voltage during these  transient periods. Equation 11 calculates the minimum  capacitance required to keep the output-voltage  overshoot to a desired value.

Equation 12 can be used for the output ripple criteria  and finding the minimum output capacitance needed.  VOUT_RIPPLE is the maximum acceptable ripple. In this  example, the allowed ripple is 33mV that results in  minimum capacitance of 6.1μF.  > × × L OUT SW OUT _RIPPLE ΔI C 8 f V               (12)  Note that the impact of output capacitor ESR on the  ripple is not considered in Equation 12.

The  inductor ripple is bypassed through the output capacitor.  Equation 14 calculates the RMS current that the output  capacitor must support. In this example, it is 229mA.

It is recommended to add a resistor R4  in series with C4 to slow down switch-on speed of the  HS switch and improve radiated EMI problems. The R4  value depends on the size of the HS switch. For most  applications, it’s approximately 5Ω ~ 10Ω. Too high  values for R4 may cause insufficient C4 charging in high  duty-cycle applications. Slower switch-on will also  increase switch losses and reduce efficiency.  UVLO Setting  The under-voltage lockout (UVLO) can be programmed  using an external voltage divider on the EN pin of the  SGM61232. In this design R1 is connected between  VIN and the EN pin and R2 is connected between EN  and GND (see Figure 4). The UVLO has two thresholds,  one for power-up (turn-on) when the input voltage is  rising, and one for power-down or brownout (turn-off)  when the voltage is falling. In this design, the turn-on  (enable to start switching) occurs when VIN rises above  7V (UVLO rising threshold). When the regulator is  working, it will not stop switching (disabled) until the  input falls below 5.5V (UVLO falling threshold).  Equations 1 and 2 are provided to calculate the  resistors. For this example, the nearest standard  resistor values are R1 = 402kΩ and R2 = 82.5kΩ.

Due to the limited  voltage slew rate required by the load or limited  available input current, a ramp is needed in many  applications to avoid input voltage sag during startup  (UVLO) or to avoid over-current protection that can  occur during output capacitor charging. Soft-start will  solve all these issues by limiting the output voltage slew  rate.  Equation 3 (with ISS = 2μA and VREF = 0.8V) can be  used to calculate the soft-start capacitor for a required  soft-start time (tSS). In this example, the output  capacitor value is relatively small (2 × 47μF) and the  soft-start time is not critical because it does not require  too much charge for 3.3V output voltage. However, it is  better to set a small arbitrary value, like CSS = 10nF that  results in 4ms startup time.  Feedback Resistors Setting  Use resistor dividers (R5 and R6) to set the output  voltage using Equations 15 and 16.  × − 5 REF 6 OUT REF R V R  = V V                      (15)    × +     5 OUT REF 6 R V  = V 1 R                   (16)  Recommended to choose R5 around 10kΩ and  calculate R6 from Equation 15. Use accurate and stable  resistors (1% or better) to enhance output accuracy.  For this example, the selected values are R5 = 18kΩ  and R6 = 5.76kΩ, resulting in a 3.3V output voltage.  Compensation Network Setting  Several techniques are used by engineers to  compensate a DC/DC regulator. The method presented  here uses simple calculations and generally results in  high phase margins. In most conditions, the phase  margin will be between 60 and 90 degrees. In this  method the effects of the slope compensation are  ignored. Because of this approximation, the actual  cross over frequency is usually lower than the  calculated value.  First, the converter pole (fP) and ESR-zero (fZ) are  calculated from Equations 17 and 18. For COUT, the  worst de-rated value of 47.6μF should be used.  Equations 19 and 20 can be used to find an estimation  for closed-loop crossover frequency (fCO) as a starting  point (choose the lower value).  × × OUT P OUT OUT I f  = 2π V C                   (17)  × × Z COUT OUT 1 f  = 2π ESR C               (18)  × CO P Z f  = f f                            (19)  × SW CO P f f  = f 2                         (20)  For this design, fP = 3.04kHz and fZ = 1.11MHz.  Equation 19 yields 58.21kHz for crossover frequency  and Equation 20 gives 28.65kHz. The lower value  28.65kHz will be chosen as the intended crossover  frequency. Having the crossover frequency, the  compensation network (R3 and C6) can be calculated.  R3 sets the gain of the compensated network at the  crossover frequency and can be calculated by Equation  21.  × × × × × CO OUT OUT 3 m REF COMP 2π f V C R  = g V GM              (21)  C6 sets the location of the compensation zero along  with R3.

A compensation pole can be implemented if desired by  adding capacitor C7 in parallel with the series  combination of R3 and C6. Use the larger value  calculated from Equation 23 and Equation 24 for C7 to  set the compensation pole. The selected value of C7 is  33pF.  × COUT OUT 7 3 ESR C C  =  R                 (23)  × × 7 SW 3 1 C  = π f R                    (24)         SGM61232  28V, 3A, Buck DC/DC Converter      12  OCTOBER 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued)  Layout Considerations  A PCB layout example is provided in Figure 5 and  Figure 6. This layout has been proved to bring good  results although other layout designs may also obtain  good performance.  • Bypass the VIN pin to GND pin (where it connects to  the anode pin of the power diode) with low-ESR  ceramic capacitors (10μF/X5R or better) and place  them as close as possible to the device.  • Connect the diode as close as possible to SW and  GND pins.  • Share the same GND connection point with the input  and output capacitors.  • Connect the device GND to the PCB ground plane  right at the GND pin.  • Minimize the length and the area of the connection  route from SW pin to the cathode of the diode and the  inductor to reduce the noise coupling from this area.  • Consider sufficient ground plane area on the top side  for proper heat dissipation. Because the SGM61232  has a fused lead frame, the GND pin acts as a heat  conduction path from the die to the PCB for better  cooling. Connect the large internal or back-side ground  planes to the top-side ground near the device with  thermal vias for better heat dissipation.    1:BOOT 2:VIN 3:EN 4:SS 8:SW 7:GND 6:COMP 5:VSENSE GND VIN GND VOUT VOUT SW GND   Figure 5.
