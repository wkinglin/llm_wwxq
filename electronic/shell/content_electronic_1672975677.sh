It is designed to maximize  audio performance in portable applications. The audio  power amplifier is designed for the portable application  that needs low-component count and can operate from  a single 2.7V to 5.5V power supply. Under the condition  of using a 5.0V power supply to drive a 16Ω speaker, it  can deliver a continuous average power of 132mW per  channel, and the distortion (THD+N) is typically 0.1%.  No external compensation is required for the amplifier  gain, which is externally configured through two  resistors for each input channel.  The SGM4812C provides an active-high, micro-power  consumption shutdown mode which is controlled  externally and an internal thermal shutdown protection.  The SGM4812C is available in Green MSOP-10  package. It operates over an ambient temperature  range of -40℃ to +85℃.  "}'

Exposure to  absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods  may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any  conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended  Operating Conditions section is not implied.    ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION  This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are  not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all  integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions.  Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures  can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle  performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision  integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage  because even small parametric changes could cause the  device not to meet the published specifications.
