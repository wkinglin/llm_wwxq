This highly integrated 1.26A device is capable of  fast charging and supports a wide input voltage range  suitable for wearable and earphone applications. I2C  programming makes it a very flexible powering and charger  design solution.  The device includes four main power switches: input reverse  blocking FET (RBFET, Q1), high-side switching FET for Buck  or Boost mode (HSFET, Q2), low-side switching FET for Buck  or Boost mode (LSFET, Q3) and battery FET that controls the  interconnection of the system and battery (BATFET, Q4). The  bootstrap diode for the high-side gate driving is also  integrated. The internal power path has a very low impedance  that reduces the charging time and maximizes the battery  discharge efficiency. Moreover, the input voltage and current  regulations provide maximum charging power delivery to the  battery with various types of input sources.  A wide range of input sources are supported, including  standard USB hosts, charging ports and USB compliant high  voltage adaptors. The SGM41518 is USB 2.0 and USB 3.0  power specifications compliant with input current and voltage  regulation. This limit is determined by the detection circuit in  the system (e.g. USB PHY).  The SGM41518 is capable of boosting the battery voltage to  supply 5V (adjustable 4.85V/5V/5.15V/5.3V) on PMID. The  Boost mode is used to charge another battery by the control  of PMID_GD. The PMID_GD pin is used to drive an external  P-MOSFET to disconnect Boost output PMID from attached  accessories.  The system voltage is regulated slightly above the battery  voltage by the power path management circuit and is kept  above the programmable minimum system voltage (3.5V by  default). Therefore, system power is maintained even if the  battery is completely depleted or removed. Dynamic power  management  (DPM)  feature  is  also  included  that  automatically reduces the charge current if the input current  or voltage limit is reached. If the system load continues to  increase after reduction of charge current down to zero, the  power path management provides the deficit from battery by  discharging battery to the system until the system power  demand is fulfilled. This is called supplement mode, which  prevents the input source from overloading.  Starting and termination of a charging cycle can be  accomplished without software control. The sensed battery  voltage is used to decide for starting phase of charging in one  of the three phases of charging cycle: pre-conditioning,  constant current or constant voltage. When the charge  current falls below a preset limit and the battery voltage is  above recharge threshold, the charger function will  automatically terminate and end the charging cycle. If the  voltage of a charged battery falls below the recharge  threshold, the charger begins another charging cycle.  Several safety features are provided in the SGM41518 such  as over-voltage and over-current protections, battery  temperature monitoring, charging safety timing, thermal  shutdown and input UVLO. TS pin is connected to an NTC  thermistor for battery temperature monitoring and protection  in both charge and Boost modes according to JEITA profile.  This device also features thermal regulation in which the  charge current is reduced, if the junction temperature  exceeds 80℃ or 120℃ (selectable).   Charging status is reported by the STAT output and  fault/status bits. A negative pulse is sent to the nINT output  pin as soon as a fault occurs to notify the host. BATFET reset  control is provided by nQON pin to exit ship mode or for a full  system reset.  The SGM41518 is available in a Green WLCSP-2.0×2.4-30B  package.

The SGM41518 can  accommodate a wide range of input sources including USB,  wall adaptor and car chargers. It is optimized for 5V input  (USB voltage) but is capable of operating with input voltages  from 3.9V to 13.5V. It also supports JEITA profile for battery  charging safety at high or low temperatures. Automatic power  path selection to power the system (SYS) from the input  source (VBUS), battery (BAT) or both is another feature of the  device. Battery charge current is programmable and can  reach a maximum of 1.26A (charge).  The device may operate in several different modes:  In HIZ mode, the reverse blocking FET (Q1), internal REGN  LDO, converter switches and some other parts of the internal  circuit remain off to save the battery while it supplies DC  power to the system through BATFET.  In the sleep mode, the switching is stopped. The charger  goes to the sleep mode when the input source voltage (VVAC)  is not high enough for charging the battery. In other words,  VVAC is smaller than VBAT + VSLEEP (where VSLEEP is a small  threshold) and Buck converter is not able to charge, even at  its maximum duty cycle. The Boost may also go to the sleep  mode if similar issue happens in the reverse direction (when  VVAC is almost equal to or smaller than VBAT).  In supplement mode, the input source power is not enough to  supply system demanded power and the battery assists by  discharging to the system in parallel and providing the deficit.    Power-On Reset (POR)  The internal circuit of the device is powered from the greater  voltage between VVBUS and VBAT. When the voltage of the  selected source goes above its UVLO level (VVBUS >  VVAC_UVLOZ or VBAT > VBAT_UVLOZ), a POR happens and  activates the sleep comparator, battery depletion comparator  and BATFET driver. Upon activation, the I2C interface will  also be ready for communication and all registers reset to  their default values.    Power-Up from Battery Only (No Input  Source)  When only the battery is presented as a source and its  voltage is above depletion threshold (VBAT_DPL_RISE), the  BATFET turns on and connects the battery to the system.  The quiescent current is minimum because the REGN LDO  remains off. Conduction losses are also low due to small  RDSON of BATFET. Low losses help to extend the battery run  time.   The discharge current through BATFET is continuously  monitored. In the supplement mode, if a system overload (or  short) occurs (IBAT > IBATFET_OCP), the BATFET is turned off  immediately and BATFET_DIS bit is set to 1. The BATFET  will not enable until the input source is applied or one of the  BATFET Enable Mode (Exit Ship Mode) methods (explained  later) is used to activate the BATFET.    Power-Up Process from the Input Power  Source  Upon connection of an input source (VBUS), its voltage  sensed from VAC pin is checked to turn on the internal REGN  LDO regulator and the bias circuits (whether the battery is  present or not). The input current limit is determined and set  before the Buck converter is started. The sequences of  actions when VBUS as input source is powered up are:  1. REGN LDO power-up.  2. Poor power source detection (qualification).  3. Input power source type detection. (Based on PSEL input.  It is used to set the default input current limit (IINDPM[4:0]).)  4. Setting of the input voltage limit threshold (VINDPM  threshold).  5. DC/DC converter power-up.    Details of the power-up steps are explained in the following  sections.           High Input Voltage, 1.26A Single-Cell Battery Charger  SGM41518  with NVDC Power Path Management      18  JUNE 2023    SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued)  REGN LDO Power-Up  The REGN low dropout regulator powers the internal bias  circuits, HSFET and LSFET gate drivers and TS rail  (thermistor pin). The STAT pin can also be pulled up to REGN.  The REGN enables when the following 2 conditions are  satisfied and remain valid for a 220ms delay time, otherwise  the device stays in high impedance mode (HIZ) with REGN  LDO off.  1. VVAC > VVAC_PRESENT.  2. VVAC > VBAT + VSLEEPZ (in Buck mode) or VVBUS < VBAT +  VSLEEP (in Boost mode).  In HIZ state, the quiescent current drawn from VBUS is very  small (less than IVBUS_HIZ). System is powered only by the  battery in HIZ mode.    Poor Power Source Detection (Qualification)  When REGN LDO is powered, the input source (adaptor) is  checked for its type and current capacity. To start the Buck  converter, the input (VBUS) must meet the following  conditions:  1. VVBUS < VVAC_OV.  2. VVBUS > VVBUSMIN_RISE during tBAD_SRC test period (30ms TYP)  in which the IBAD_SRC (30mA TYP) current is pulled from  VBUS.  If the test is failed, the conditions are repeatedly checked  every two seconds. As soon as the input source passes  qualification, the VBUS_GD bit in status register is set to 1  and a pulse is sent to the nINT pin to inform the host. Type  detection will start as next step.    Input Power Source Type Detection  The input source detection will run through the PSEL pin  while REGN LDO is powered and after the VBUS_GD bit is  set. The input current limit of the SGM41518 is set based on  the state of PSEL pin. When the input source type detection is  completed, the PMID_GD pin is asserted to high and the  PG_STAT bit is set to 1. A pulse is sent to nINT pin to inform  the host when the input source type detection is completed.  Some registers and pins are also updated as detailed below:  1. Input current limit register (the value in the IINDPM[4:0]) is  changed to set current limit.  2. PG_STAT (power good) bit is set.  3. VBUS_STAT[2:0] register is updated to indicate USB or  adaptor input source types.  The input current is always limited by the IINDPM[4:0] register  and the limit can be updated by the host if needed.  Input Current Limit by PSEL  PSEL pin interfaces with USB physical layer (PHY) for input  current limit setting. The USB PHY device output is used to  detect if the input is a USB host or a charging port. In the  host-control mode, the host must enable IINDET_EN bit for  reading the PSEL value and updating the IINDPM[4:0]. In the  default mode, IINDPM[4:0] is updated automatically by PSEL  value in real-time as given in Table 1.    Table 1. Input Current Limit Setting from PSEL  Input Detection  PSEL Pin  Input Current  Limit (ILIM)  VBUS_STAT[2:0]  USB Host SDP  High  500mA  001  Adaptor  Low  2400mA  011    Setting of the Input Voltage Limit Threshold  (VINDPM Threshold)  A wide voltage range (3.9V to 5.4V, 5.9V to 9V, 10.5V to 12V)  is supported for the input voltage limit setting in VINDPM[3:0]  and VINDPM_OS[1:0]. 4.5V is the default for USB.  The device supports dynamic tracking of the battery voltage  (VINDPM). VDPM_BAT_TRACK[1:0] bits can be used to  enable  tracking (00 to disable tracking) and set the tracking  offset value. When the tracking is enabled, the input voltage  limit will be set to the larger value between the VINDPM[3:0] and  VBAT + VDPM_BAT_TRACK[1:0]. The VDPM_BAT_TRACK[1:0]  tracking offset can be set to 200mV, 250mV or 300mV. And  this function only takes effect when VINDPM_OS[1:0] = 00.    DC/DC Converter Power-Up  The 1.5MHz switching converter composed of LSFET and  HSFET is enabled, which can start switching when the input  current limit is set. Converter is initiated with a soft-start when  the system voltage is ramped up. If SYS voltage is less than  2.2V, the input current is limited to 250mA or IINDPM[4:0],  depending on whichever is smaller, otherwise the limit is set  to IINDPM[4:0].  The BATFET remains on to charge the battery if the battery  charging function is enabled, otherwise BATFET turns off.  When converter operates for battery charging, it acts as an  efficient, fixed frequency synchronous Buck converter  regardless of the input/output voltages and currents. However,  it is capable of switching to PFM mode at light load when  charging is disabled or when the detected battery voltage is  less than minimum system voltage setting. PFM operation  can be enabled or prevented in either Buck or Boost mode  through using the PFM_DIS bit.           High Input Voltage, 1.26A Single-Cell Battery Charger  SGM41518  with NVDC Power Path Management      19  JUNE 2023    SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued)  Boost Mode  The SGM41518 supports Boost mode. When a load device is  connected to the USB port, the converter can operate as a  step-up synchronous converter (Boost mode) with 1.5MHz  switching frequency to supply power from the battery to that  load. Converter will be set to Boost mode if at least 30ms is  passed from enabling this mode (BST_CONFIG bit = 1) and  the following conditions are satisfied:  1. VBAT > VBATLOW_BST.  2. VVBUS < VBAT + VSLEEP (in sleep mode).  3. Acceptable voltage range at TS pin (VBHOT < VTS < VBCOLD).  The output voltage is set to VPMID = 5V and is maintained as  long as VBAT is above VBATLOW_BST. The VBUS_STAT[2:0]  status register bits are set to 111 in Boost mode.  To minimize the output overshoot in Boost mode, the device  starts with PFM first and then switches to PWM. As stated  before, PFM can be avoided by using PFM_DIS bit in Buck  and Boost modes.  The SGM41518 keeps the Q1 FET off in Boost mode. By  setting both the BST_CONFIG bit and the CHG_CONFIG bit  to 1 during adaptor insertion or removal, the charger will  automatically transition between charging mode and Boost  mode. The device is in charge mode when the adaptor is  plugged in and the conditions to start a new charge cycle are  valid. If the adaptor is removed and the Boost enable  conditions are active, the device automatically transitions to  Boost mode to power accessories connected to the PMID.    Host Mode and Default Mode Operation with  Watchdog Timer  After a power-on reset, the device starts in default mode  (standalone) with all registers reset as if the watchdog timer is  expired. When the host is in sleep mode or there is no host,  the device stays in the default mode in which the SGM41518  operates like an autonomous charger. The battery is charged  for 11.5 hours (default value for the fast charging safety timer).  Then the charge stops while Buck converter continues to  operate to power the system load. In this mode,  WATCHDOG_FAULT bit is high.  Most of the flexibility features of the SGM41518 become  available in the host mode when the device is controlled by a  host with I2C. By setting the WD_RST bit to 1, the charger  mode changes from default mode to host mode. In this mode,  the WATCHDOG_FAULT bit is low and all device parameters  can be programmed by the host. To prevent the device  watchdog from reset that results in going back to default  mode, the host must disable the watchdog timer by setting  WATCHDOG[1:0] = 00, or it must consistently reset the  watchdog timer before expiry by writing 1 to WD_RST to prevent  WATCHDOG_FAULT bit from being set. Every time a 1 is written  to the WD_RST, the watchdog timer will restart counting.  Therefore, it should be reset again before overflow (expiry) to  keep the device in the host mode. If the watchdog timer expires  (WATCHDOG_FAULT bit = 1), the device returns to default mode  and all registers are reset to their default values except for  EN_ICHG_MON[1:0], IINDPM[4:0], PFM_DIS, SYS_MIN[2:0],  MIN_BAT_SEL,  Q1_FULLON,  OVP[1:0],  BOOSTV[1:0],  VINDPM[3:0],  VDPM_BAT_TRACK[1:0],  BATFET_DIS,  BATFET_DLY,  VINDPM_INT_MASK,  IINDPM_INT_MASK,  REG_RST and VINDPM_OS[1:0] bits that keep their values  unchanged.

The battery connection switch (BATFET) is in the charge or  discharge current path and features low on-resistance (10mΩ  TYP) to allow high efficiency and low voltage drop.    Charging Cycle in Autonomous Mode  Charging is enabled if CHG_CONFIG = 1 and nCE pin is  pulled low. In default mode, the SGM41518 runs a charge  cycle with the default parameters itemized in Table 2. At any  moment, the device can be controlled by changing to the host  mode.    Table 2. Charging Parameter Default Setting  Default Mode  SGM41518  Charging Voltage (VREG)  4.208V  Charging Current (ICHG_REG)  340mA  Pre-Charge Current (IPRECHG)  40mA  Termination Current (ITERM)  60mA  Temperature Profile  JEITA  Safety Timer  11.5h    Start a New Charging Cycle  If the converter can start switching and all the following  conditions are satisfied, a new charge cycle starts:  • NTC temperature fault is not asserted (TS pin).  • Safety timer fault is not asserted.  • BATFET is not forced off. (BATFET_DIS bit = 0).  • Charging enabled (3 conditions: CHG_CONFIG bit = 1,  ICHG[5:0] register is not 0mA and nCE pin is low).  • Battery voltage is below the programmed full charge level  (VREG).  A new charge cycle starts automatically if battery voltage falls  below the recharge threshold level (VREG - 100mV or VREG -  200mV configured by VRECHG bit). Also, if the charge cycle  is completed, a new charging cycle can be initiated by  toggling of the nCE pin or CHG_CONFIG bit.  Normally a charge cycle terminates when the charge voltage  is above the recharge threshold level and the charging  current falls below the termination threshold if the device is  not in thermal regulation or dynamic power management  (DPM) mode.  Charge Status Report  STAT is an open-drain output pin that reports the status of  charge and can drive an LED for indication: a low indicates  that charging is in progress, a high shows that charging is  completed or disabled and alternating low/high (blinking)  show a charging fault. The STAT may be disabled (keep the  open-drain switch off) by setting EN_ICHG_MON[1:0] = 10 or  11.  The CHRG_STAT[1:0] status register reports the present  charging phase and status by two bits: 00 = charging disabled,  01 = in pre-charge, 10 = in fast charging (constant current mode  or constant voltage mode) and 11 = charging completed.  A negative pulse is sent on nINT pin to inform the host when a  charging cycle is completed.  In addition, the output status of STAT pin can be set by  STAT_SET[1:0] bits, 00 = LED off (HIZ), 01 = LED on (low),  10 = LED blinking at 1s on 1s off, 11 = LED blinking at 1s on  3s  off.  This  two  bits  only  take  effect  when  EN_ICHG_MON[1:0] = 01.    Battery Charging Profile  The SGM41518 features a full battery charging profile with  five phases. In the beginning of the cycle, the battery voltage  (VBAT) is tested, and appropriate current and voltage  regulation levels are selected as shown in Table 3.  Depending on the detected status of the battery, the proper  phase is selected to start or for continuation of the charging  cycle. The phases are trickle charge (VBAT < 2.2V),  pre-charge and fast-charge (constant current and constant  voltage).    Table 3.

Battery Charging Profile    Charge Termination  A charge cycle is terminated when the battery voltage is  higher than the recharge threshold and the charge current  falls below the programmed termination current. Unless there  is a high power demand for system and it needs to operate in  supplement mode, the BATFET turns off at the end of the  charge cycle. Even after termination, the Buck converter  operates continuously to supply the system.  CHRG_STAT[1:0] bits are set to 11 and a negative pulse is  sent to nINT pin after termination.  If the charger is regulating input current, input voltage or  junction temperature instead of charge current, termination  will be temporarily prevented. EN_TERM bit is termination  control bit and can be set to 0 to disable termination before it  happens.  At low termination currents (60mA TYP), the offset in the  internal comparator may give rise to a higher (+5mA to  +10mA) actual termination current. A delay in termination can  be added (optional) as a compensation for comparator offset  using a programmable top-off timer. During the delay,  constant voltage charge phase continues and gives the falling  charge current a chance to drop closer to the programmed  value. The top-off delay timer has the same restrictions of the  safety timer. As an example, under some conditions, if the  safety timer is suspended, the top-off timer will also be  suspended or if the safety timer is slowed down, the  termination  timer  will  also  be  slowed  down.  The  TOPOFF_ACTIVE bit reports the active/inactive status of the  top-off timer. The CHRG_STAT[1:0] and TOPOFF_ACTIVE  bits can be read to find status of the termination.  Any of the following events resets the top-off timer:   1. Disable to enable transition of nCE (charge enable).  2. A low to high change in the status of termination.  3. Set REG_RST bit to 1.  The setting of the top-off timer is applied at the time of  termination detection and unless a new charge cycle is  started, modifying the top-off timer parameters after  termination has no effect. A negative pulse is sent to nINT  when top-off timer is started or ended.    Temperature Qualification  The charging current and voltage of the battery must be  limited when battery is cold or hot. A thermistor input for  battery temperature monitoring is included in the device that  can protect the battery based on JEITA guidelines.

JEITA highlights  the considerations and limits that should be considered for  charging at cold or hot battery temperatures. High charge  current and voltage must be avoided outside the normal  operating temperatures (typically 0 ℃ and 60 ℃). This  functionality can be disabled if not needed. Four temperature  levels are defined by JEITA from T1 (minimum) to T4  (maximum). Outside this range, charging should be stopped.  The corresponding voltages sensed by NTC are named VT1 to  VT4. Due to the sensor negative resistance, a higher  temperature results in a lower voltage on TS pin. The battery  cool range is between T1 and T2, and the warm range is  between T3 and T4. Charge must be limited in the cool and  warm ranges.  One of the conditions for starting a charge cycle is having the  TS voltage within VT1 to VT4 window limits. If during the  charge, battery gets too cold or too hot and TS voltage  exceeds the T1 - T4 limits, charging is suspended (zero  charge current) and the controller waits for the battery  temperature to come back within the T1 to T4 window.  JEITA recommends reducing charge current to 1/2 of fast  charging current or lower at cool temperatures (T1 - T2). For  warmer temperature (within T3 - T4 range), charge voltage is  recommended to be kept below 4.1V.  The SGM41518 exceeds the JEITA requirement by its flexible  charge parameter settings. At warm temperature range (T3 -  T4), the charge voltage is set to the lower of VREG and 4.1V  when JEITA_VSET_H = 0, the charge voltage is set to VREG  when JEITA_VSET_H = 1, and the charge current can be  reduced down to 0%, 20% or 50% of fast charging current by  the JEITA_ISET_H[1:0] bits. At cool temperatures (T1 - T2),  the current setting can be reduced down to 50% or 20% of  fast charging current selected by the JEITA_ISET_L bit when  JEITA_ISET_L_EN = 1, and the charge voltage is set to VREG  when JEITA_VSET_L = 0, the charge voltage is set to the  lower of VREG and 4.1V when JEITA_VSET_L = 1. Additional,  the cool threshold T2 and warm threshold T3 can be changed  through JEITA_VT2 [1:0] and JEITA_VT3 [1:0], and the  charge current can be disabled by setting JEITA_ISET_L_EN  = 0.    Figure 5. Battery Thermistor Connection and Bias  Network    A 103AT-2 type thermistor is recommended to use for the  SGM41518. Other thermistors may be used and bias network  (see Figure 5) can be calculated based on the following  equations:      × × −     =     × − − × −         THCOLD THHOT T1 T4 T2 THHOT THCOLD T4 T1 1 1 R R V V R 1 1 R 1 R 1 V V   (1)      −     =    +         T1 T1 T2 THCOLD 1 1 V R 1 1 R R   (2)  Where, VT1 and VT4 are TCOLD and THOT threshold voltages on  TS pin as percentage to VREGN, RTHCOLD and RTHHOT are  thermistor resistances (RTH) at desired T1 (Cold) and T4 (Hot)  temperatures. Select TCOLD = 0℃ and THOT = 60℃ for Li-Ion  or Li-polymer batteries. For a 103AT-2 type thermistor  RTHCOLD = 27.28kΩ and RTHHOT = 3.02kΩ, the calculation  results are: RT1 = 5.29kΩ and RT2 = 30.72kΩ. The standard  value is 5.23kΩ for RT1 and 30.9kΩ for RT2.

The temperature must  remain within the VBCOLD to VBHOT thresholds, otherwise the  Boost mode will be suspended and VBUS_STAT[2:0] bits are  set to 000. Moreover, NTC_FAULT[2:0] register is updated to  report Boost mode cold or hot condition. Once the  temperature returns within the window, the Boost mode is  resumed and NTC_FAULT[2:0] register is cleared to 000  (normal).

TS Pin Thermistor Temperature Window  Settings in Boost Mode    Safety Timer  Abnormal battery conditions may result in prolonged charge  cycles. An internal safety timer is considered to stop charging  in  such  conditions.  If  the  safety  time  is  expired,  CHRG_FAULT[1:0] bits are set to 11 and a negative pulse is  sent to nINT pin. By default, the charge time limit is 2 hours if  the battery voltage does not rise above VBATLOW threshold.  And it is 11.5 hours if it goes above VBATLOW. This feature is  optional and can be disabled by clearing EN_TIMER bit. The  11.5 hours limit can also be changed to 20 hours by clearing  CHG_TIMER bit.  The safety timer counts at half clock rate when charger is  running under input voltage regulation, input current  regulation, JEITA cool or thermal regulation. Because in  these conditions, the actual charge current is likely to be less  than the register setting. As an example, if the safety timer is  set to 11.5 hours and the charger is regulating the input  current (IINDPM_STAT bit = 1) in the whole charging cycle,  the actual safety time will be 23 hours. Clearing the  TMR2X_EN bit will disable the half clock rate feature.  The safety timer is paused if a fault occurs and charging is  suspended. It will resume once the fault condition is removed.  If charging cycle is stopped by a restart or by toggling nCE pin  or CHG_CONFIG bit, the timer resets and restarts a new  timing.    Narrow Voltage DC (NVDC) Design in SGM41518  The SGM41518 features an NVDC design using the BATFET  that connects the system to the battery. By using the linear  region of the BATFET, the charger regulates the system bus  voltage (SYS pin) above the minimum setting using Buck  converter even if the battery voltage is very low. MOSFET  linear mode allows for the large voltage difference between  SYS and BAT pins to appear as VDS across the switch while  conducting and charging battery. SYS_MIN[2:0] register sets  the minimum system voltage (default 3.5V). If the system is in  minimum system voltage regulation, VSYS_STAT bit is set.  The BATFET operates in linear region when the battery  voltage is lower than the minimum system voltage. The  system voltage is regulated to 180mV (TYP) above the  minimum system voltage setting. The battery gradually gets  charged and its voltage rises above the minimum system  voltage and lets BATFET change from linear mode to fully  turned-on switch such that the voltage difference between the  system and battery is the small VDS of fully on BATFET.  The system voltage is always regulated to 50mV (TYP) above  the battery voltage if:  1. The charging is terminated.  2. Charging is disabled and the battery voltage is above the  minimum system voltage setting.      Figure 7.

To implement DPM, the device always monitors the  input current and voltage to regulate power demand from the  source and avoid input adaptor overloading or to meet the  maximum current limits specified in the USB specs.  Overloading an input source may result in either current trying  to exceed the input current limit (IINDPM) or the voltage tending  to fall below the input voltage limit (VINDPM). With DPM, the  device keeps the VSYS regulating to its minimum setting by  reducing the battery charge current adequately such that the  input parameter (voltage or current) does not exceed the limit.  In other words, charge current is reduced to satisfy IIN ≤ IINDPM  or VIN ≥ VINDPM whichever occurs first. DPM can be either an  IIN type (IINDPM) or VIN type (VINDPM) depending on which  limit is reached.  Changing to the supplement mode may be required if the  charge current is decreased and reached to zero, but the  input is still overloaded. In this case, the charger reduces the  system voltage below the battery voltage to allow operation in  the supplement mode and provide a portion of system power  demand from the battery through the BATFET.  The IINDPM_STAT or VINDPM_STAT status bits are set  during an IINDPM or VINDPM respectively.     Battery Supplement Mode  If the system voltage drops below the battery voltage, the  BATFET gradually starts to turn on. The threshold margin is  180mV if VSYS_MIN setting is less than VBAT and 45mV if  VSYS_MIN setting is larger than VBAT. At low discharge currents,  the BATFET gate voltage is regulated (RDS modulation) such  that the BATFET VDS stays at 25mV. At higher currents, the  BATFET will turn fully on (reaching its lowest RDSON). From  this point, increasing the discharge current will linearly  increase the BATFET VDS (determined by RDSON × ID). Using  the MOSFET linear mode at lower currents prevents swinging  oscillation from entering and exiting the supplement mode.  BATFET gate regulation V-I characteristics is shown in Figure  8. If the battery voltage falls below its minimum depletion, the  BATFET turns off and exits supplement mode.      Figure 8. BATFET Gate Regulation V-I Curve    BATFET Control for System Power Reset  and Ship Mode  Ship Mode (BATFET Disable)  Ship mode is usually used when the system is stored or in  idle state for a long time or is in shipping. In such conditions, it  is better to completely disconnect battery and make system  voltage zero to minimize the leakage and extend the battery  life. To enter ship mode, the BATFET has to be forced off by  setting BATFET_DIS bit. The BATFET turns off immediately if  BATFET_DLY bit is 0, or turns off after a tSM_DLY delay (12.5  seconds) if BATFET_DLY is set.    Exit Ship Mode (BATFET Enable)  To exit the ship mode and enable the BATFET, one of the  following can be applied:  With no input power (no operating VBUS):  1. Connect the adaptor to the input with a valid voltage to the  VBUS input.  2. Pull nQON pin from logic high to low to enable BATFET, for  example, by shorting nQON to GND. The negative pulse  width should be at least a tSHIPMODE (1s TYP) for deglitching.  With the chip already powered by VBUS:  3. Clear BATFET_DIS bit by using host and I2C.  4. Set REG_RST bit to reset all registers including BATFET_DIS  bit to default (0).  5.

This  feature can be used to apply a power-on reset to the system.  Host can toggle BATFET_DIS bit to cycle power off/on and  reset the system. A push-button connected to nQON pin or a  negative pulse can also be used to manually force a system  power cycle when BATFET is ON (BATFET_DIS bit = 0). For  this function, a negative logic pulse with a minimum width of  tQON_RST (10s TYP) must be applied to the nQON pin that  results in a temporary BATFET turn-off for tBATFET_RST (320ms  TYP) that automatically turns on afterward. This functionality  can be disabled by setting BATFET_RST_EN bit to 0.  In summary, the nQON pin controls BATFET and system  reset in two different ways:  1. Enable BATFET: Applying an nQON logic high to low  transition with longer than tSHIPMODE deglitch time (negative  pulse) turns on BATFET to exit ship mode (Figure 9 left). HIZ is  also enabled (EN_HIZ = 1) when exiting shipping mode. After  exiting shipping mode, the host can disable HIZ (EN_HIZ = 0).  OTG cannot be enabled (BST_CONFIG = 1) until HIZ is  disabled.  2. Reset BATFET: By applying a logic low for a duration of at  least tQON_RST to nQON pin while VBUS is not powered and  BATFET is allowed to turn on (BATFET_DIS bit = 0), the  BATFET turns off for tBATFET_RST and then it is re-enabled  resulting in a system power-on reset (Figure 9 right). This  function can be disabled by clearing BATFET_RST_EN bit.  A typical push button circuit for nQON is given in Figure 10.

A good  input source is detected if all following conditions on VVBUS  are satisfied and input type detection is completed:  • VVBUS is in the operating range: VVAC_UVLOZ < VVBUS < VVAC_OV.  • Device is not in sleep mode: VVBUS > VBAT + VSLEEP.  • Input source is not poor: VVBUS > VVBUSMIN_RISE when IBAD_SRC  (30mA TYP) loading is applied. (Poor source detection.)  • Completed input source type detection.    Charge Status (STAT Pin)  Charging state is indicated with the open-drain STAT pin as  explained in Table 4. This pin is able to drive an LED (see  Figure 1). The functionality of the STAT pin is disabled if the  EN_ICHG_MON[1:0] bits are set to 10 or 11.    Table 4. STAT Pin Function  Charging State  STAT Indicator  Charging battery (or recharge)  Low (LED ON)  Charging completed  High (LED OFF)  Charging is disabled or in sleep mode  High (LED OFF)  Charge is suspended due to input over-voltage,  TS fault, timer faults or system over-voltage or  Boost mode is suspended (TS fault)  1Hz Blinking  EN_ICHG_MON[1:0] = 01, controlled by register  only, no matter with charging state  STAT_SET[1:0]    nINT Interrupt Output Pin  When a new update occurs in the charger states, a 256μs  negative pulse is sent through the nINT pin to interrupt the  host. The host may not continuously monitor the charger  device and by receiving the interrupt, it can react and check  the charger situation on time.  The following events can generate an interrupt pulse:  1. Faults reflect in REG0x09 register (watchdog, Boost  overload, charge faults and battery over-voltage).  2. Charging is completed.  3. PSEL detection identifies a connected source (USB or  adaptor).  4. Input source voltage enters the 'input good' range:  a) VVBUS exceeds VBAT (not in sleep mode).  b) VVBUS comes below VVAC_OV.  c) VVBUS remains above VVBUSMIN_RISE when IBAD_SRC  (30mA TYP) load current is applied.  5. Input removes or out of the 'input good' range.  6.  A DPM event (VINDPM or IINDPM) occurs (a maskable  interrupt).  Once a fault happens, the INT pulse is asserted immediately  and the fault bits are updated in REG0x09. Fault status is not  reset in the register until the host reads it. A new fault will not  assert a new INT pulse until the host reads REG0x09 and all  the previous faults are cleared. Therefore, in order to read the  current time faults, the host must read REG0x09 two times  consecutively. The first read returns the history of the fault  register status (from the time of the last read or reset) and the  second one checks the current active faults. As an exception,  the NTC_FAULT bit reports the actual real-time status of TS  pin.     PMID Voltage Indicator (PMID_GD)  In the SGM41518, accessory devices can be connected to  the charger PMID pin to draw power from the adaptor through  Q1 direct path or battery Boost mode. An optional external  P-MOSFET can be placed between the charger PMID pin and  the accessory input to disconnect the power path during  over-current and over-voltage conditions. PMID_GD is used  to drive the external P-MOSFET through an inverter.  PMID_GD output high turns on the inverter, which pulls the  P-MOSFET gate low to turn on the P-MOSFET, while  PMID_GD output low turns off the P-MOSFET.  With the adaptor plugged in, when VVBUS is above battery but  below VACOV and passes poor source detection, PMID_GD  goes from low to high. If the Q1 current exceeds 106% of the  IINDPM threshold or the adaptor voltage rises above 6V  (VBST_OVP), PMID_GD will go from high to low.  If all conditions are valid, the high voltage adaptor over  VBST_OVP will continue to charge the battery. The external  P-MOSFET will remain off to protect the accessory from  over-voltage fault.  When the adaptor is plug out, PMID_GD goes low before  battery Boost mode initiates.  In battery Boost mode, the device regulates the PMID voltage  between 4.85V and 5.3V as a regulated power supply for  accessory devices. PMID_GD is driven high to low for all  conditions exiting Boost mode such as Boost mode disable in  register, ACOV, TS fault, battery drain (VBAT_DPL), BATFET  over-current (IBATFET_OCP), etc.         High Input Voltage, 1.26A Single-Cell Battery Charger  SGM41518  with NVDC Power Path Management      27  JUNE 2023    SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued)  SGM41518 Protection Features  Monitoring of Voltage and Current  During the converter operation, the input and system voltages  (VBUS and VSYS) and switch currents are constantly  monitored to assure safe operation of the device in both Buck  and Boost modes, as described below.    Buck Mode Voltage and Current Monitoring  1. Input Over-Voltage (ACOV)  Converter switching will stop as soon as VBUS voltage  exceeds VVAC_OV over-voltage limit that is programmable by  OVP[1:0] in REG0x06. It is selectable among 5.5V, 6.5V,  10.5V and 14V (default) for USB or 5V, 9V or 12V adaptors  respectively.  Each time VBUS exceeds the OVP limit, an INT pulse is  asserted. As long as the over-voltage persists, the  CHRG_FAULT[1:0] bits are set to 01 in REG0x09. Fault will  be cleared to 00 if the voltage comes back below limit (and a  hysteresis threshold) and host reads the fault register.  Charger resumes its normal operation when the voltage  comes back below OVP limit.  2. System Over-Voltage (SYSOVP)  During a system load transient, the device clamps the system  voltage to protect the system components from over-voltage.  The SYSOVP over-voltage limit threshold is 350mV +  VSYS_REG (system regulation voltage + 350mV). Once a  SYSOVP occurs, switching stops to clamp any overshoot and  a 20mA sink current is applied to SYS to pull the voltage  down.    Boost Mode Voltage and Current Monitoring  1. Output Short Protection for PMID  The SGM41518 real-time monitors the battery discharge  current through the BATFET (Q4) to ensure safe operation in  Boost mode. Under an over-current condition where the  Boost input current exceeds IBATFET_OCP, the device is latched  within 100µs. When an over-current condition is detected, the  BOOST_FAULT bit of fault register is set to 1, indicating a  fault in Boost operation, and an INT is asserted to notify the  host.  2. Output Over-Voltage Protection for PMID  In Boost mode, converter stops switching and PMID_GD is  pulled low if PMID voltage rises above regulation and  exceeds the VBST_OVP over-voltage limit (6V TYP).    Thermal Regulation and Shutdown  Buck Mode Thermal Protections  Internal junction temperature (TJ) is always monitored to  avoid overheating. A limit of +120 ℃ is considered for  maximum IC surface temperature in Buck mode and if TJ  intends to exceed this level, the device reduces the charge  current to keep maximum temperature limited to +120℃  (thermal regulation mode) and sets the THERM_STAT bit to 1.  As expected, the actual charging current is usually lower than  programmed value during thermal regulation. Therefore, the  safety timer runs at half clock rate and charge termination is  disabled during thermal regulation.  If the junction temperature exceeds TSHUT (+150℃), thermal  shutdown protection arises in which the converter is turned off,  CHRG_FAULT[1:0] bits are set to 10 in the fault register and  an INT pulse is sent.   When the device recovers and TJ falls below the hysteresis  band of TSHUT_HYS (30℃ under TSHUT), the converter resumes  automatically.    Boost Mode Thermal Protections  Similar to Buck mode, TJ is monitored in Boost mode for  thermal shutdown protection. If junction temperature exceeds  TSHUT (+150℃), the Boost mode will be disabled (BST_CONFIG  bit clears). If TJ falls below the hysteresis band of TSHUT_HYS (30℃  under TSHUT), the Boost can recover again by re-enabling  BST_CONFIG bit by host.    Battery Protections  Battery Over-Voltage Protection (BATOVP)  The over-voltage limit for the battery is 3.8% above the  battery regulation voltage setting. In case of a BATOVP,  charging or external direct charging stops right away, the  BAT_FAULT bit is set to 1 and an INT pulse is sent.    Battery Over-Discharge Protection  If battery discharges too much and VBAT falls below the  depletion level (VBAT_DPL_FALL), the device turns off BATFET to  protect battery. This protection is latched and is not recovered  until an input source is connected to the VBUS pin. In such  condition, the battery will start charging with the small ISHORT  current (30mA TYP) first as long as VBAT < VSHORTZ. When  battery voltage is increased and VSHORTZ < VBAT < VBATLOW,  the charge current will increase to the pre-charge current  level programmed in the IPRECHG[3:0] register.    Battery Over-Current Protection for System  The BATFET will latch off, if its current limit is exceeded due to  a short or large overload on the system (IBAT > IBATFET_OCP). To  reset this latch off and enable BATFET, the 'Exit Ship Mode'  procedure must be followed.

I2C is the well-known  2-wire serial communication interface that can connect one  (or more) master device(s) to some slave devices for two-way  communication. The bus lines are named serial data (SDA)  and serial clock (SCL). The device that initiates a data  transfer is a master. A master generates the SCL signal.  Slave devices have unique addresses to identify. A master is  typically a micro controller or a digital signal processor.  The SGM41518 operates as a slave device that address is  0x3B (3BH). It has sixteen 8-bit registers, numbered from  REG0x00 to REG0x0F. A register read beyond REG0x0F  (0x0F) returns 0xFF.    Physical Layer  The standard I2C interface of SGM41518 supports standard  mode and fast mode communication speeds. The frequency  of standard mode is up to 100kbits/s, while the fast mode is  up to 400kbits/s. Bus lines are pulled high by weak current  source or pull-up resistors and in logic high state with no  clocking when the bus is free. The SDA and SCL pins are  open-drain.    I2C Data Communication  START and STOP Conditions  A transaction is started through taking control of the bus by  master if the bus is free. The transaction is terminated by  releasing the bus when the data transfer job is done as shown  in Figure 11. All transactions are started by master which  applies a START condition on the bus lines to take over the  bus and exchange data. At the end, the master terminates the  transaction by applying one (or more) STOP condition.  START condition is generated by master when SCL is high  and a high to low transition on the SDA. Similarly, a STOP is  defined when SCL is high and SDA goes from low to high.  START and STOP are always generated by a master. After a  START and before a STOP the bus is considered busy.    SDA SCL START STOP S P     Figure 11. I2C Bus in START and STOP Conditions    Data Bit Transmission and Validity  The data bit (high or low) must remain stable on the SDA line  during the HIGH period of the clock. The state of the SDA can  only change when the clock (SCL) is LOW. For each data bit  transmission, one clock pulse is generated by master. Bit  transfer in I2C is shown in Figure 12.  SDA SCL Data Line Stable  and Data Valid Change of Data  Allowed     Figure 12. I2C Bus Bit Transfer    Byte Format  Data is transmitted in 8-bit packets (one byte at a time). The  number of bytes in one transaction is not limited. In each  packet, the 8 bits are sent successively with the Most  Significant Bit (MSB) first. An acknowledge (or not-acknowledge)  bit must come after the 8 data bits. This bit informs the  transmitter whether the receiver is ready to proceed for the  next byte or not. Figure 13 shows the byte transfer process  with I2C interface.      Figure 13.

With the acknowledge bit, the receiver informs the transmitter  that the byte is received, and another byte is expected or can  be sent (ACK) or it is not expected (NCK = not ACK). Clock  (SCL) is always generated by master, including the  acknowledge clock pulse. SDA line is released for receiver  control during the acknowledge clock pulse. And the receiver  can pull the SDA line low as ACK (reply a 0 bit) or let it be  high as NCK during the SCL high pulse. After that, the master  can either STOP (P) to end the transaction or send a new  START (S) condition to start a new transfer (called repeated  start). For example, when master wants to read a register in  slave, one start is needed to send the slave address and  register address, and then, without a stop condition, another  start is sent by master to initiate the receiving transaction  from slave. Master then sends the STOP condition and  releases the bus.    Data Direction Bit and Addressing Slaves  The first byte sent by master after the START is always the  target slave address (7 bits) and the eighth data-direction bit  (R/W). R/W bit is 0 for a WRITE transaction and 1 for READ  (when master is asking for data). Data direction is the same  for all next bytes of the transaction. To reverse it, a new  START or repeated START condition must be sent by master  (STOP will end the transaction). Usually the second byte is a  WRITE sending the register address that is supposed to be  accesses in the next byte(s). The data transfer transaction is  shown in Figure 14.  WRITE: If the master wants to write in the register, the third  byte can be written directly as shown in Figure 15 for a single  write data transfer. After receiving the ACK, master may issue  a STOP condition to end the transaction or send the next  register data, which will be written to the next address in a  slave as multi-write. A STOP is needed after sending the last  data.   READ: If the master wants to read a single register (Figure  16), it sends a new START condition along with device  address with R/W bit = 1. After ACK is received, master reads  the SDA line to receive the content of the register. Master  replies with NCK to inform slave that no more data is needed  (single read) or it can send an ACK to request for sending the  next register content (multi-read). This can continue until an  NCK is sent by master. A STOP must be sent by master in  any case to end the transaction.          Figure 14.

In the multi-write, every  new data byte sent by master is written to the next register of  the device. A STOP is sent whenever master is done with  writing into device registers.  In a multi-read transaction, after receiving the first register  data (its address is already written to the slave), the master  replies with an ACK to ask the slave for sending the next  register data. This can continue as much as it is needed by  master. Master sends back an NCK after the last received  byte and issues a STOP condition.    1 9 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 W 9 SCL SDA 1 9 D7 D6 D5 D4 D3 D1 D0 D2 SCL (Continued) SDA (Continued) START by  Master ACK by  Device ACK by  Device Frame 1  Frame 2 Byte#1  I2C Slave Address Byte Byte#2  Register Address Byte Frame 3  ACK by  Device Byte#3 Data Byte 1 to SGM41518 Register   1 9 ACK by  Device Byte#4 Data Byte 2 to SGM41518 Register   Frame 4 D7 D6 D5 D4 D3 D1 D0 D2 1 9 D7 D6 D5 D4 D3 D1 D0 D2 Frame N  ACK by  Device STOP by  Master Byte#N Data Byte n to SGM41518 Register   SCL (Continued) SDA (Continued) B7 B6 B5 B4 B3 B1 B0 B2     Figure 17.

In the design, it comes along with a host controller (a  processor with I2C interface) and a single-cell Li-Ion or  Li-polymer battery.    Detailed Design Procedure  Inductor Design  Small energy storage elements (inductor and capacitor) can  be used since the high frequency (1.5MHz) switching  converter is used in the SGM41518. Inductor should tolerate  current which is higher than the maximum charge current  (ICHG) plus half the inductor peak to peak ripple current (∆I)  without saturation:    ∆ > + SAT CHG I I I 2   (3)  The inductor ripple current is determined by the input voltage  (VVBUS), duty cycle (D = VBAT/VVBUS), switching frequency (fS =  1.5MHz) and the inductance (L). In CCM:    ( ) × × − ∆= × VBUS S V D 1 D I f L   (4)  Inductor ripple current is maximum when D ≈ 0.5. If the input  voltage range (VVBUS) is limited higher, D values can be  considered.   In the practical designs, inductor peak to peak current ripple  is selected in a range from 20% to 40% of the maximum DC  current ∆I = (0.2 ~ 0.4) × ICHG for a good trade-off between  inductor size and efficiency. Selecting the higher ripple allows  choosing of smaller inductance.  For each application, VVBUS and ICHG are known, so L can be  calculated from (4) and current rating of the inductor can be  selected from (3). Choose an inductor that has small DCR  and core losses at 1.5MHz to have high efficiency and cool  operation at full load.    Input Capacitor Design  Select low ESR ceramic input capacitor (X7R or X5R) with  sufficient voltage and RMS ripple current rating for decoupling  of the input switching ripple current (ICIN). The RMS ripple  current in the worst case is around the ICHG/2 when D ≈ 0.5. If  the converter does not operate at D ≈ 50%, in the worst case,  the capacitor RMS current can be estimated from (5) in which  D is the closest operating duty cycle to 0.5.    ( ) CIN CHG I I D 1 D = × × −   (5)  For SGM41518, place CIN across PMID and GND pins close  to the chip. Voltage rating of the capacitor must be at least 25%  higher than the normal input voltage to minimize voltage  derating. For a 13.5V input voltage, the preferred rating is  25V or higher.  A CIN = 22μF is suggested.    Output Capacitor Design  The output capacitance (on the system) must have enough  RMS (ripple) current rating to carry the inductor switching  ripple and provide enough energy for system transient current  demands. ICOUT (COUT RMS current) can be calculated by:    RIPPLE COUT RIPPLE I I 0.29 I 2 3 = ≈ × ×   (6)  And the output voltage ripple can be calculated by:      ∆ = −     OUT OUT O 2 OUT S VBUS V V V 1 8LC f V   (7)  Increasing L or COUT (the LC filter) can reduce the ripple.   The internal loop compensation of the device is optimized for >  22μF ceramic output capacitor. 10V, X7R (or X5R) ceramic  capacitors are recommended for the output.    Input Power Supply Considerations  To power the system from the SGM41518, either an input  power source with a voltage range from 3.9V to 13.5V and at  least 100mA current rating should power VBUS, or a  single-cell Li-Ion battery with voltage higher than VBAT_UVLOZ  should be connected to BAT pin of the device. The input  source must have enough current rating to allow maximum  power delivery through charger (Buck converter) to the  system.

To reduce the ringing issues and noise generation, it is  important to design a proper layout for minimizing the current  path impedance and loop area. A graphical guideline for the  current loops and their frequency content is provided in  Figure 19. The following considerations can help to make a  better layout.   1. Place the input capacitor between PMID and GND pins as  close as possible to the chip with the shortest copper  connections (avoid vias). Choose the smallest capacitor size.  2. Connect one pin of the inductor as close as possible to the  SW pin of the device and minimize the copper area  connected to the SW node to reduce capacitive coupling from  SW area to nearby signal traces. This decreases the noise  induced  through  parasitic  stray  capacitances  and  displacement currents to other conductors. SW connection  should be wide enough to carry the charging current. Keep  other signals and traces away from SW if possible.  3. Place output capacitor GND pin as close as possible to the  GND pin of the device and the GND pin of input capacitor CIN.  It is better to avoid using vias for these connections and keep  the high frequency current paths short enough and on the  same layer. A GND copper layer under the component layer  helps to reduce noise emissions. Note that the DC current  and AC current paths are in the layout and keep them short  and decoupled as much as possible.  4. For analog signals, it is better to use a separate analog  ground (AGND) branched only at one point from GND pin. To  avoid high current flow through the AGND path, it should be  connected to GND only at one point (preferably the GND pin).   5. Place decoupling capacitors close to the IC pins with the  shortest copper connections.  6. Solder the exposed thermal pad of the package to the PCB  ground planes. Ensure that there are enough thermal vias  directly under the IC, connecting to the ground plane on the  other layers for better heat dissipation and cooling of the  device.  7. Select proper sizes for the vias and ensure that enough  copper is available to carry the current for the given current  path. Vias usually have some considerable parasitic  inductance and resistance.
