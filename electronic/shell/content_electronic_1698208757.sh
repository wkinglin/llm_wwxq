With  precision current limit, the device can provide excellent  accuracy and be well applied to many system  protection applications. The output current limit  threshold and the transient over-current blanking timer  can be adjusted by the user. Due to the back-to-back  FETs packaged inside the chip, the SGM2536 allows  bidirectional current to flow through the channel when it  is turned on, but prohibits bidirectional current flow  when it is turned off, which is very suitable for USB  OTG. The VOUT rise time can be programmed by setting  an additional capacitor to the SS pin, which can  minimize inrush current. Programmable over-voltage  protection is used to turn off the device if the IN raises  over a threshold value and the downstream circuitry is  not damaged by unintended power supply.   The SGM2536 is available in a Green TQFN-2×2-10L  package.       "}'

It ensures the  safety of the power delivery system due to its rich  features. When the VIN is greater than VUVP_R, the  device starts to sample the voltage of the EN/UVLO pin  (VEN/UVLO). If VEN/UVLO exceeds VUVLO_R, BFET and HFET  start conducting and the current can flow in both  directions. When the VIN is less than VUVP_F or VEN/UVLO  < VUVLO_F, both BFET and HFET are turned off to  realize the reverse current blocking.  After device start-up, the SGM2536 will monitor the VIN  and forward current (from IN to OUT). By controlling  HFET, the load current cannot exceed the set current  limit threshold (IILIM), and over-voltage spikes are cut-off  if they exceed the user-adjustable over-voltage lockout  threshold (VOVLO). The fast-trip response of the device  can  provide  rapid  protection  against  serious  over-current during short-circuit of OUT pin, so as to  prevent the system from being damaged by harmful  voltage and current. In addition, the device also  provides a user-adjustable over-current blanking timer  to allow short-time over-current in the power path  without tripping the device frequently. Therefore,  SGM2536 not only provides complete protection  functions, but also ensures the maximum system  uptime during transient events.  There is an integrated thermal sensor to protect itself  when the device temperature exceeds the TSD.    Under-Voltage Lockout (UVLO and UVP)  The SGM2536 implements under-voltage protection at  IN pin to prevent IN voltage from being too low for  normal operation of system and equipment. A fixed  locking threshold voltage (VUVP) is provided inside the  device for under-voltage protection. In addition, the  comparator on the EN/UVLO terminal can be used to  set  the  user-adjustable  under-voltage  protection  threshold through the external resistor divider. Figure 4  and Equation 1 show how to set the specific value of  under-voltage protection threshold using an external  resistor divider.

Under-Voltage Lockout    Over-Voltage Lockout (OVLO)  The SGM2536 implements over-voltage lockout at  OVLO pin to prevent IN voltage from being too high for  normal operation of system and equipment. The  comparator on the OVLO pin is used to set the  user-adjustable  over-voltage  protection  threshold  through the external resistor divider. If the voltage of  OVLO pin exceeds the VOVLO_R, the device will shut  down the power path. When the voltage of OVLO pin is  lower than the VOVLO_F, the power path will be reopened  with inrush control. There is a hysteresis between the  rising threshold and falling threshold of OVLO. The  Equation 2 and Figure 5 show how to set the specific  value of over-voltage protection threshold using an  external resistor divider.

Over-Voltage Lockout and Recovery  Inrush Current, Over-Current, and  Short-Circuit Protection   SGM2536 adopts four levels of forward over-current  protection function:    Programmable slew rate (SR) for inrush current  protection.    Programmable current limit threshold (IILIM) for  over-current in steady state or start-up.    Programmable  threshold  (ISC)  for  severe  over-current in steady state or start-up.    Fixed IFT for fast-trip function when short-circuit of  OUT occurs.    Slew Rate (SR) and Inrush Current Protection  When hot-plug or system charging large capacitive load  occurs, a large inrush current is generated in the  equipment power path. The input connector may be  damaged or the input power rail voltage may drop,  which affects the normal operation and even restarts  other equipment in the system.   For a given COUT, the relationship between the slew  rate (SR) and inrush current (IINRUSH) is shown in  Equation 3.  INRUSH OUT I  (mA) SR (V/ms) C  ( F) = μ            (3)   The slew rate can be controlled by connecting a  capacitor at the SS pin to reduce inrush current. For a  given slew rate, the corresponding CSS can be  calculated by Equation 4. When the SS pin is left  floating, the fastest output slew rate can be obtained.  SS 2000 C  (pF) SR (V/ms) =             (4)  NOTE: For CSS > 10nF, a 100Ω resistor is recommended to  be in series with the CSS on the SS pin.    Current Limit  In case of output over-current, the device actively limits  the current after the blanking timer expiring. When the  load current exceeds the over-current threshold (IILIM),  but is less than the short-circuit threshold (2 × IILIM), the  device discharges CITIMER on the ITIMER pin through an  internal 1.8μA pull-down current source. Once the load  current decreases below the over-current threshold  before the CITIMER is discharged by ΔVITIMER, the ITIMER  pin will be pulled up to VINT internally and the current  limit will not be triggered. If the over-current condition  still exists after the CITIMER voltage drops by ΔVITIMER,  the device will limit the current to the over-current  threshold by regulating HFET. At the same time, the  ITIMER pin is recharged to the VINT to maintain the  default state before the next over-current event, which  ensures a complete blanking time for each over-current  event. In general, the device can provide protection  against over-current events and also allow transient  current pulses to flow through the power path. For a  given over-current threshold, the value of RILIM can be  calculated by Equation 5.  ILIM ILIM 3260 R  ( ) I - 0.03 (A) = Ω   or    ILIM ILIM 3334 R  ( ) I  (A) = Ω    (5)        5.5A, 23.7mΩ Electronic Fuse  SGM2536  Supporting Bidirectional Current Conduction      16  OCTOBER 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued)  NOTES:   1. The device only provides forward (from IN to OUT)  over-current protection function.  2. Leave the ILIM pin floating to set the over-current threshold  near zero, and the device can hardly be loaded.  3. The current limit circuit implements the fold-back  mechanism. In the fold-back region (0V < VOUT < VFB), the  current limit threshold is smaller than the current limit  threshold (IILIM) under steady state.  4. When the ILIM is short to the GND under normal  operations, it will be detected as a fault case. There is a  minimum InFAULT which the device allows in this case before  the pin short condition is detected.   The blanking time can be adjusted by changing the  capacitance connected to the ITIMER pin. Over-current  blanking time can be calculated by Equation 6.    ITIMER ITIMER ITIMER ITIMER ΔV  (V) C  (nF) t  (ms) I  (μA) × =        (6)  NOTES:   1. Leaving the ITIMER pin floating or short to GND sets the  minimum  over-current  blanking  time.  But  it  is  not  recommended to leave ITIMER pin short to GND, because it  increases the current consumption of the device.  2. The active current limit set by RILIM is still valid during  start-up, which ensures that the load current does not exceed  IILIM during start-up. However, there is no over-current  blanking time in the start-up process.  3. Increasing CITIMER can increase the over-current blanking  time, but it also increases the time for CITIMER to charge to VINT.  If the next over-current case occurs before the CITIMER is fully  charged to the VINT, the current blanking time of this event will  be shorter than intended.  During the active current limit, there is more power  dissipation on the HFET because the output voltage  drops. If the internal temperature of the device exceeds  the TSD, the HFET will be turned off, and the device will  either be latched off (SGM2536xL) or restarted  automatically after a certain time interval (SGM2536xR).    0A 0V VINT IOUT ITIMER PG  SGM2536Px 0V TJ VPG TSD nFAULT SGM2536Fx IILIM 2 × IILIM VIN 0V 1.2V 0V 0V TJ THYS VnFAULT OUT PGTH SGM2536Px  tPGD tPGA tPGD ΔVITIMER tILIM tILIM tITIMER tITIMER Transient Over-Current Persistent Output Overload ITIMER Expired Overload Removed Persistent Output Overload ITIMER Expired Thermal Shutdown Current Limit  Operation Current Limit  Operation 1.09V   Figure 7.

A fast-trip comparator with scalable threshold  (ISC = 2 × IILIM) is adopted inside the device, which  allows users to program the fast-trip threshold in low  current system. A fixed fast-trip threshold is also set  inside the device for fast protection against hard  short-circuit events in steady state. It is recommended  that the fixed fast-trip threshold be greater than the  maximum value of the scalable fast-trip threshold.  HFET will be completely turned off within tFT if the  current exceeds IFT or ISC. Then the device will turn  HFET on again after a short of deglitch time in a current  limit mode. In this way, the rapid recovery of HFET can  be realized after a transient severe over-current event,  and the drop of OUT voltage can be minimized. If the  fault persists, the devices continue to operate in the  current limit mode, causing the internal temperature of  the device to rise until the thermal shutdown.

The user can calculate the load current  through the voltage of the ILIM pin connected to the  RILIM. The relationship between VILIM and IOUT is shown  in Equation 7.  ILIM OUT ILIM IMON V  (μV) I  (A) R  (Ω)   G  (μA/A) = ×         (7)   NOTES:   1. ILIM pin is sensitive to capacitive loads. In order to ensure  the normal operation of the device, the parasitic capacitance  of the ILIM pin needs to be less than 50pF.  2. The analog load current monitor is only applicable to the  forward current (from IN to OUT).    Reverse Current Protection  The SGM2536 is internally integrated with back-to-back  MOSFETs connected in a common drain configuration.  When the device is disabled or shutdown, both FETs  are turned off, so the current in both directions is  blocked.    Over-Temperature Protection (OTP)  The SGM2536 always monitors the temperature (TJ) of  the internal die. Once the internal temperature exceeds  the TSD, the device shuts down immediately. The  SGM2536 will not turn on until the internal temperature  is lower than a safe threshold (TSD - THYS).  When SGM2536xL triggers the thermal shutdown, it  still remains in the shutdown state unless the  equipment is re-enabled or power cycled. When  SGM2536xR triggers the thermal shutdown, it remains  in the shutdown state until the internal temperature of  the equipment drops by THYS. After that, it will retry to  turn on automatically after a tRST delay time if the device  is still enabled.    Fault Response and Indication (nFAULT)  Table 2 shows the protection response of equipment  under different fault conditions. The SGM2536Fx  provides an active-low external fault flag pin.   A latched fault can be cleared by power cycling (pulling  VIN to 0V) or re-enable (pulling EN/UVLO pin below  VSD). This will also reset the tRST in SGM2536xR. It is  worth mentioning for the whole SGM2536 series,  pulling down EN/UVLO below the UVLO threshold  cannot clear the latched fault. The SGM2536xR will  retry automatically after the tRST timer expiring when a  fault has occurred.    Power Good Pin (PG)  The SGM2536Px provides an active-high open-drain  output (PG) as the indication pin of power good. It is  asserted as high according to the PGTH pin voltage  and the equipment working state. PG pin needs to be  pulled up to an external power supply.  At the initial stage of power-on, PG is pulled down.  Then the device enters the start-up sequence, in which  the HFET has been controlled and not fully conductive.  When the gate voltage of HFET reaches overdrive,  HFET is fully conductive and the start-up sequence is  completed, VPGTH is higher than VPGTH_R, and PG is  asserted high after a deglitch time (tPGA).  The PG will be de-asserted when the PGTH voltage  falls below VPGTH_F or when the system has faults other  than over-current during steady state. The deglitch time  is tPGD, when PG is de-asserted.  When the device is not powered, the PG pin should be  low. However, there is no effective power supply to  drive the PG pin down to GND in this case. If the PG is  pulled up by an independent power supply and the  device is not powered, there may be a small voltage on  the PG caused by sink current, which is a function of  the pull-up supply and pull-up resistance connected to  the PG. In order to avoid the small voltage on the PG  pin being detected as logic high by the external related  circuit, the sink current of the pin should be minimized.  Table 1.

SPGD is  asserted when the IN voltage is in a proper range  (UVP/UVLO < VIN < OVLO) and the inrush sequence of  the device is completed. SPGD pin needs to be pulled  up to an external power supply.  At the initial stage of power-on, SPGD pin is pulled  down. Then the device enters the start-up sequence, in  which the HFET has been controlled and not fully  conductive. When the gate voltage of HFET reaches  overdrive, HFET is fully conductive and the start-up  sequence is completed, the SPGD is asserted high.  When the device is not powered, the SPGD pin should  be low. However, there is no effective power supply to  drive the SPGD pin down to 0V in this case. If the  SPGD is pulled up by an independent power supply  and the device is not powered, there may be a small  voltage on the SPGD caused by sink current, which is a  function of the pull-up supply and pull-up resistance  connected to the SPGD. In order to avoid the small  voltage on the SPGD pin being detected as logic high  by the external related circuit, the sink current of the pin  should be minimized.    Device Functional Modes  When operating under the recommended operating  conditions, the device has one applicable operating  mode.    Table 4.

The ILIM  pin can be used as an ADC input to the MCU for current  monitoring.  NOTE: ILIM pin is sensitive to capacitive loading. In order to  ensure the normal operation of the device, the parasitic  capacitance of the ILIM pin needs to be less than 50pF.  For the SGM2536Px, resistor divider of PGTH can be  connected to either IN or OUT, depending on which  voltage is more suitable as a power good indication.  Typical Application  Many smartphones are equipped with a USB OTG  function, which not only allows charging the phone  battery, but also allows the phone to be used as a USB  host or to charge accessories such as headphones. In  addition, some mobile phones are equipped with  wireless charging and support wireless charging to  charge other devices in reverse.

In  this  case,  the  SGM2536  provides  over-current and over-voltage protections. Another  situation is that when the USB interface is connected to  the accessories such as headphones that require the  mobile phone battery to provide power, the internal  MCU of the mobile phone recognizes the accessories  and configures the battery charging IC to BOOST mode  and supplies power to the accessories through the USB  interface. The SGM2536 needs to provide a current  from OUT to IN, and since the IN pin requires a certain  voltage (VUVP_R) to turn on the power switch, a diode  and resistor in parallel with the device can provide the  required bias voltage. The MCU then enables the  SGM2536 and establishes a low impedance path to  deliver power to the accessories.  Similarly, the device provides a bidirectional power flow  path during wireless charging and wireless reverse  charging.

Setting Over-Voltage Threshold  The over-voltage threshold is set by a resistor divider  connected to the OVLO pin. This threshold can be  calculated from Equation 8:  OV_R 1 2 IN_OV 2 V   (R R ) V   R × + =           (8)   where VOV_R is the rising threshold of the OVLO pin and  R1 & R2 are the resistors of the resistor divider. Since  R1 & R2 causes additional leakage current to flow out of  the input voltage, their values need to be taken into  account for the acceptable leakage current of the  system. The leakage current flowing through R1 & R2  from the supply voltage is IR12 = VIN/(R1 + R2).  Considering that an external active device connected to  a resistor divider causes additional leakage current, this  increases  the  calculation  error  of  the  supply  over-voltage threshold. Therefore, the leakage current  flowing through R1 & R2 (IR12) should be greater than 20  times the leakage current expected by the OVLO pin.  As can be seen from the EC table, the maximum  leakage current of the OVLO pin is 0.1μA, and VOV_R =  1.2V.  According  to  the  application  scenario  requirements, VIN_OV = 14V. Given R1 = 470kΩ, R2 =  44.06kΩ can be obtained according to the above  equation.  Using the nearest standard 1% resistor values, R1 =  470kΩ & R2 = 44.2kΩ are chosen.    Setting Output Voltage Rise Time (tR)  During the design process, it must be ensured that the  junction temperature of the device does not meet the  thermal shutdown threshold under either start-up or  steady-state conditions. Given that the power stress to  which the device is subjected at start-up is typically an  order of magnitude larger than under steady-state  conditions, the determination of start-up time and  inrush current limit is particularly important to avoid  thermal shutdown at start-up.  After rise time (tR) is determined, the slew rate (SR) can  be calculated by:  IN R V  (V) 9V SR (V/ms)  1.8V/ms t  (ms) 5ms = = =       (9)  The value of the capacitance (CSS) on the SS pin  corresponding to this SR can be calculated by the  following equation:  SS 2000 2000 C (pF) 1111 pF SR(V/ ms) 1.8 = = =    (10)  Select  the  nearest  standard  capacitor  with  a  capacitance of 1100pF.  The inrush current can be calculated as:  INRUSH OUT I  (mA) SR (V/ms) C  (μF) 1.8 47 84.6mA = × = × =  (11)  During inrush, the average power dissipation inside the  device can be calculated as:  INRUSH IN INRUSH I  (A) V  (V) 0.085 9 PD  (W) 0.38W 2 2 × × = = =  (12)   Based on the calculated power dissipation, the  corresponding thermal shutdown time must be higher  than the output rise time. Figure 13 shows that for  0.38W, the device thermal shutdown time is greater  than 100ms, which is much larger than the output rise  time (5ms). Therefore, setting the output rise time to  5ms has no negative impact on device security.      Figure 13.

This threshold can  be calculated from Equation 13:  PGTH_R 3 4 PG 4 V (R R ) V R × + =            (13)   where VPGTH_R is the rising threshold of the PGTH pin  and R3 & R4 are the resistors of the resistor divider.  Since R3 & R4 causes additional leakage current to flow  out of the output voltage, their values need to be taken  into account for the acceptable leakage current of the  system. The leakage current flowing through R3 & R4  from the supply is IR34 = VIN/(R3 + R4). Considering that  an external active device connected to a resistor divider  causes additional leakage current, this increases the  calculation error of the supply over-voltage threshold.  Therefore, the leakage current flowing through R3 & R4  (IR34) should be greater than 20 times the leakage  current expected by the PGTH pin.  As can be seen from the EC table, the maximum  leakage current of the PGTH pin is 0.3μA, and VPGTH_R  = 1.2V.  According to the application scenario  requirements, VPG = 4.5V. Given R3 = 100kΩ, R4 =  36.4kΩ can be obtained according to the above  equation.  Choose the nearest standard 1% resistor values, R3 =  100kΩ & R4 = 36.5kΩ are recommended.    Setting Over-Current Threshold (IILIM)  The over-current threshold can be set by the resistor  RILIM connected to the ILIM pin, and its value can be  calculated by Equation 14:  ILIM ILIM 3334 3334 R (Ω) 1025.8Ω I  (A) 3.25A = = =      (14)   Choose the nearest standard 1% resistor values, RILIM  = 1050Ω is recommended.    Setting Over-Current Blanking Interval  (tITIMER)  The over-current blanking time can be set by CITIMER,  and it can be calculated as following.  ITIMER ITIMER ITIMER ITIMER t  (ms) I  (μA) 2 1.8 C  (nF) 2.4nF ΔV  (V) 1.5 × × = = =  (15)  Select  the  nearest  standard  capacitor  with  a  capacitance of 2.2nF.  Selecting External Bias Resistor (R5)  In OTG mode, the initial state of the SGM2536PR is off.  The initial voltage across the USB bus through the  diode (D1) and resistor (R5) can be calculated by:  VBUS (V) = VOUT (V) - VF (V) - ILOAD (A) × R5 (Ω)   (16)  where:  VOUT is the voltage supplied by the battery charging IC  in Boost mode.  VF is the forward voltage drop across diode D1.  ILOAD is the current drawn by USB powered peripheral  initially.  The USB bus voltage must be higher than VUVP_R to  ensure that the SGM2536PR can be turned on and can  provide sufficient current for USB peripheral devices.  Given VF = 0.4V, VOUT_MIN = 4.5V, VUVP_R = 2.54V, ILOAD  = 100mA, the maximum R5 value of 15.6Ω can be  calculated. Select R5 = 11Ω.  The power dissipation of R5 under initial conditions can  be calculated from Equation 17.  PD (W) = ILOAD (A) × ILOAD (A) × R5 (Ω)  (17)  When the load current is 100mA and R5 is 11Ω, the  power dissipation across R5 is 0.11W. Therefore, a  resistor with a power rate of 0.25W is appropriate.    External Diode (D1) Selection  1. The diode forward voltage drop should be as small  as possible to ensure that there is enough headroom  for the USB bus voltage to be greater than VUVP_R.  2. The diode can flow more than the maximum current  required by the USB peripheral.  3. It must have small footprint.     Power Supply Recommendations  The SGM2536 is designed for a supply voltage from  2.7V to 23V. If the power supply is more than a few  inches away from the device, it is recommended to  place an input bypass ceramic capacitor greater than  0.1μF. The rated current of the power supply must be  greater than the over-current threshold set by the  device, otherwise the supply voltage will drop in the  event of an over-current or short-circuit.         5.5A, 23.7mΩ Electronic Fuse  SGM2536  Supporting Bidirectional Current Conduction      25  OCTOBER 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued)  Transient Protection  If the short-circuit or over-current limit case occurs, the  device may cut off the current, and due to the parasitic  inductance in series at the input and output of the  device, a positive voltage spike will occur at the input  and output, and a negative voltage spike will occur at  the output. The amplitude of the voltage spike is  determined by the parasitic inductance. These  transients can cause the voltage on the device pins to  exceed their maximum absolute rating if the following  measures are not taken:    The length of the wires at the input and output of  the device is as small as possible.    A TVS diode is paralleled at the input port of the  device to absorb a positive voltage spike, and a  Schottky diode is connected in parallel to the  output port to absorb a negative voltage spike.    Choose a large PCB GND plane.    Connect a low ESR ceramic capacitor larger than  10μF near the OUT pin.    A ceramic capacitor greater than 10μF is  connected near the input pin to absorb and  suppress transient voltage spikes and ringing.  The value of the input capacitance can be calculated  from the Equation 18:  IN SPIKE (Absolute) IN LOAD IN L V V I C = + ×       (18)   where VIN is the rating of the input voltage, ILOAD is the  load current, LIN is the effective inductance seen  looking into the source, and CIN is the capacitance of  the input.  For applications such as USB-C interfaces, the power  cord may be plugged into the output of the device. In  this case, the voltage stress from OUT to IN may  exceed the absolute maximum rating, so it is  recommended to add a TVS diode from OUT to IN to  clamp the voltage for safety.

Application with Optional Protection  Components  Output Short-Circuit Measurements  The output short-circuit waveform may be affected by  factors such as input leads, power supply bypass,  layout, device selection, circuit location, and output  short-circuit method. It is difficult to obtain repeatable  and similar output short-circuit test results. Therefore,  the short-circuit results in this datasheet are for  informational purposes only. Different short-circuit test  results may be achieved because of different test  conditions.    Layout Guidelines  In any application, it is recommended to connect a  decoupling capacitor of 0.1μF or greater between IN  and GND. This decoupling capacitor should be as close  as possible to IN and GND pins.  The power path should be as wide and short as  possible, with a current carrying capacity of more than  twice the device's current limit.  The GND pin of the device must be connected to PCB  ground which is a copper plane or island as short as  possible.  The IN and OUT pins of the device are used to  dissipate heat. Therefore, these two pins should be  dissipated as much as possible through the copper  plane on the top layer or bottom layer on the PCB.  Placing thermal vias on the copper plane improves  on-resistance as well as current sensing accuracy.  External components of the device as follows should be  placed as close to the corresponding pins as possible:    RILIM    CSS    CITIMER    Resistor dividers of EN/UVLO, OVLO and PGTH  The other end of these components is connected to  ground via the shortest possible path. The ILIM pin  should have a parasitic capacitance of less than 50pF,  and the connection path of this pin should be away  from the switching signal.  Protection components such as TVS or Schottky  diodes should be connected to the device via a short  path to avoid large line inductance. It is important to  note that the loop area formed by the protection  components should be as small as possible.       5.5A, 23.7mΩ Electronic Fuse  SGM2536  Supporting Bidirectional Current Conduction      26  OCTOBER 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  "}'
