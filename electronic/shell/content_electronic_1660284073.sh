In Figure 1, the ESD  diodes between the inputs and the power supply rails  will clamp the input voltage not to exceed the rails.        Figure 1. Input Equivalent Circuit    Input Current-Limit Protection  For ESD diode clamping protection, when the current  flowing through ESD diode exceeds the maximum  rating value, the ESD diode and amplifier will be  damaged, so current-limit protection will be added in  some applications. One resistor is selected to limit the  current not to exceed the maximum rating value. In  Figure 2, a series input resistor is used to limit the input  current to less than 10mA, but the drawback of this  current-limit resistor is that it contributes thermal noise  at the amplifier input. If this resistor must be added, its  value must be selected as small as possible.        Figure 2. Input Current-Limit Protection    Rail-to-Rail Output  The SGM8970-3 supports rail-to-rail output operation.  In single power supply application, for example, when  +VS = 5.5V, -VS = GND, 10kΩ load resistor is tied from  OUT pin to VS/2, the typical output swing range is from  0.005V to 5.495V.    Driving Capacitive Loads  The SGM8970-3 is designed for unity-gain stable for  capacitive load up to 470pF. If greater capacitive load  must be driven in application, the circuit in Figure 3 can  be used. In this circuit, the IR drop voltage generated  by RISO is compensated by feedback loop.        Figure 3. Circuit to Drive Heavy Capacitive Load    Power Supply Decoupling and Layout  A clean and low noise power supply is very important in  amplifier circuit design, besides of input signal noise,  the power supply is one of important source of noise to  the amplifier through +VS and -VS pins. Power supply  bypassing is an effective method to clear up the noise  at power supply, and the low impedance path to ground  of decoupling capacitor will bypass the noise to GND.  In application, 10μF ceramic capacitor paralleled with  0.1μF or 0.01μF ceramic capacitor is used in Figure 4.  The ceramic capacitors should be placed as close as  possible to +VS and -VS power supply pins.         Figure 4.

In high speed  application, the general method to eliminate noise is to  use a complete ground plane technique, and the whole  ground plane will help distribute heat and reduce EMI  noise pickup.    Reduce Input-to-Output Coupling  To reduce the input-to-output coupling, the input traces  must be placed as far away from the power supply or  output traces as possible. The sensitive trace must not  be placed in parallel with the noisy trace in same layer.  They must be placed perpendicularly in different layers  to reduce the crosstalk. These PCB layout techniques  will help to reduce unwanted positive feedback and  noise.    Typical Application Circuits  Difference Amplifier  The circuit in Figure 5 is a design example of classical  difference amplifier. If R4/R3 = R2/R1, then VOUT = (VP -  VN) × R2/R1 + VREF.        Figure 5. Difference Amplifier    High Input Impedance Difference Amplifier  The circuit in Figure 6 is a design example of high input  impedance difference amplifier, the added amplifiers at  the input are used to increase the input impedance and  eliminate drawback of low input impedance in Figure 5.        Figure 6. High Input Impedance Difference Amplifier    Active Low-Pass Filter  The circuit in Figure 7 is a design example of active  low-pass filter, the DC gain is equal to -R2/R1 and the  -3dB corner frequency is equal to 1/2πR2C. In this  design, the filter bandwidth must be less than the  bandwidth of the amplifier, the resistor values must be  selected as low as possible to reduce ringing or  oscillation generated by the parasitic parameters in  PCB layout.        Figure 7.
