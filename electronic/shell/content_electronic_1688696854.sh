The Boost converter integrates a 40V, 1.5A  internal FET which operates at 1.2MHz switching  frequency. Its strong driving ability can drive single or  multiple parallel LED strings, which can be used as  LED driver for smart phone and tablet backlight.  The default LED current can be programmed by the  external current-sense resistor RSET. By varying the  duty cycle of the PWM signal applied to the CTRL pin,  the internal reference voltage is adjusted, which  ultimately adjusts the LED sink current. With full PWM  duty cycle, the internal reference voltage VREF is 200mV  (TYP). The SGM37310 is essentially a driver that  adopts analog dimming control, and it will not produce  audible noise on the output capacitor. The SGM37310  integrates ringing cancellation, and it can effectively  reduce EMI noise in DCM mode. The SGM37310  provides excellent line regulation and load regulation,  as well as excellent load transient response. The  SGM37310 also features various protection functions  such as open LED protection, OCP protection and  thermal shutdown protection.  The SGM37310 is available in a Green TDFN-2×2-6L  package. It operates over an ambient temperature  range of -40℃ to +85℃.  "}'

ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION  This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are  not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all  integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions.  Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures  can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle  performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision  integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage  because even small parametric changes could cause the  device not to meet the published specifications.
