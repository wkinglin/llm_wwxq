These chips are guaranteed  monotonic by design.  The SGM71612R81Z has an on-chip 1.25V 10ppm/℃  reference, giving a full-scale output range of 2.5V. The  SGM71612R82Z/SGM71612R82M/SGM71612R83M  have an on-chip 2.5V 10ppm/℃ reference, giving a  full-scale output range of 5V.  The chips have a power-on control circuit, which can  ensure that DAC has a fixed output when the system is  powered on. The SGM71612R81Z and SGM71612R82Z  output 0V when the system is powered up, and the  SGM71612R82M/SGM71612R83M outputs mid-scale  when the system is powered up.  The chips have an nLDAC pin that allows the DAC to  update the output simultaneously. And the chips have  an nCLR pin that allows the DAC to be updated to a  configurable state, zero-code, mid-scale, or full-scale.  The  SGM71612R81/SGM71612R82/SGM71612R83  family uses a 3-wire SPI-compatible interface, and its  operation data rate is up to 50MHz.  The  SGM71612R81Z  and  SGM71612R82Z  are  available in Green TSSOP-16, TQFN-4×4-16BL and  FOCSP-2.6×2.6-16B packages. The SGM71612R82M  and  SGM71612R83M  are  available  in  Green  TSSOP-16 and TQFN-4×4-16BL packages.  "}'

ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION  This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are  not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all  integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions.  Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures  can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle  performance degradation to complete device failure.

The device has an  on-chip 1.25V/2.5V, 10ppm/℃ reference.  The output codes of the SGM71612R81/SGM71612R82/  SGM71612R83 family are straight binary. The ideal output  voltage is given by:    OUT REFIN N D V V Gain 2   = × ×        (1)  where:   D = Equal decimal value is 0 to 65,535.  N = 16.  Gain = Output gain setting. (If using the internal reference,  Gain = 2. If using the external reference, Gain = 1.)    Internal Reference  The SGM71612R81Z has an on-chip 1.25V, 10ppm/ ℃  reference. If the internal reference is enabled, it gives a  full-scale output of 2.5V.   The SGM71612R82Z, SGM71612R82M and SGM71612R83M  have an on-chip 2.5V, 10ppm/℃ reference. If the internal  reference is enabled, it gives a full-scale output of 5V.   For SGM71612R81/SGM71612R82 family, the internal  reference is disabled by default when the chip is powered on,  and for SGM71612R83 family, its internal reference is  enabled by default when the chip is powered on. The internal  reference can be enabled/disabled by setting the control  register (see Table 1). When using the internal reference, all  channels must be powered down at the same time. The  individual channel power-down is not supported if the internal  reference is enabled.    Output Amplifier  The output buffer amplifier has the rail-to-rail output.    Serial Interface  The SGM71612R81/SGM71612R82/SGM71612R83 family  has a 3-wire SPI-compatible interface.  For the detail operation timing sequence, please see Figure 1  and Figure 2. To prepare a new write sequence, nSYNC must  be pulled up at least 15ns before the new write sequence, so  that the falling edge of nSYNC can initiate the new write  sequence.    Table 1.

The first 3-bit  DB[31:29] are Don't care bits. The second bit DB28 is a read  or write command bit. The third 4-bit DB[27:24] are command  bits C3 to C0 (see Table 1). The meaning of left bits is  different from commands.  If C3 to C0 are DAC output data updating associated, the  fourth 4-bit DB[23:20] are DAC address bits A3 to A0 (see  Table 2). And the following 16-bit DB[19:4] are the DAC data  bits. The final 4-bit DB[3:0] are not used data bits (see Figure  4).  If C3 to C0 is command to set the internal reference register,  please refer to Table 3 and Table 4.  If C3 to C0 is command to set the power-down modes register,  please refer to Table 5, Table 6 and Table 7.  If C3 to C0 is command to set the clear code register, please  refer to Table 8 and Table 9.  If C3 to C0 is command to set the nLDAC register, please  refer to Table 10 and Table 11.  If C3 to C0 is command to set the read enable control register,  please refer to Table 12 and Table 13.  All 32-bit data are locked into the input register on the 32nd  falling edge of SCLK.    nSYNC Interrupt  In a normal write sequence, the nSYNC line must be kept low  for at least 32 falling edges of SCLK, and the DAC is updated  on the 32nd falling edge. However, if nSYNC goes high before  the 32nd falling edge, this write operation will be invalid and  ignored. An example is shown in Figure 5.

In Table  1, the command '1000' (C3 to C0) is used to set the internal  reference register. Table 3 shows how to enable or disable  the internal reference. Table 4 shows the data format for  setting the internal reference register.    Power-On Reset  The SGM71612R81Z and SGM71612R82Z reset to 0V  output when the chip is powered up. The SGM71612R82M  and SGM71612R83M reset to mid-scale output when the chip  is powered up.  There is a software reset that can perform the same DAC  reset function. And during the reset, any nLDAC and nCLR  operations are invalid.      Table 3.

Table 5 shows these power-down modes configurations. And  the operation data format is shown in Table 6 and Table 7. In  Table 6, some or all DACs can be powered down to the  selected modes by setting the according bits to '1'. Note that  when the internal reference is enabled, the chip only supports  all channels powered down at the same time. During  power-down, the content of DAC register is retained.   To exit the power-down mode, configure the target DAC  channels to normal operation mode.    Table 5.

The nCLR is active low and the falling  edge is sensitive. If the nCLR pin goes from high to low, the  chip clears the input register and resets DAC register to the  users' configured data that is set in clear code register. And  the chip resets the output according to the setting of clear  code register at the same time.  The nCLR pin can be used to set the DAC register and output  asynchronously. The nCLR status is set in clear code register  (see Table 8).   To set clear code register, please refer to command format in  Table 9.  When the nCLR pin is hold high, a full valid write operation  can call the chip to exit the clear code mode. In the operation  sequence, the part quits the clear code mode on the 32nd  falling edge of SCLK.  It will take the chip about 300ns to start changing the output  from receiving the nCLR falling edge. More details please  refer to Electrical Characteristics tables.  Table 8.

The first way is that the nLDAC pin can be tied or kept low for  a while (specified in Figure 1), after a full write command  performing, the DAC is updated on the 32nd falling edge of  SCLK.  The second way is that the nLDAC is kept high during the  32-bit write sequence, then a pulse of nLDAC is given (see  Figure 1), the DAC output is updated asynchronously.  There are also software ways to control DAC updating, which  is equal to nLDAC pin operation. Please refer to Table 10 and  Table 11.   In Table 11, when according DAC channel bit is set to '0', the  DAC output load mode is determined by nLDAC pin operation.  When according DAC channel bit is set to '1', it is equal to the  nLDAC pin connected to low, and the DAC is updated on the  32nd falling edge of SCLK.

This function is valid when  the control bit of the read control register is set to '1', and this  function is disabled when the control bit of the read control  register is set to '0'. Once the read function is enabled, the  DB28 bit of every 32-bit reading data stream must be '1' to tell  DAC that this is a read operation. The detailed sequence of  the read operation is shown in Figure 2. Correspondingly,  once the read function is enabled, the DB28 bit of every 32-bit  writing data stream must be '0' to tell DAC that this is a write  operation, and the detailed sequence of the write operation is  shown in Figure 1.
