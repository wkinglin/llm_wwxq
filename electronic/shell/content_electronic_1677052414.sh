These ADCs are powered by a single unipolar 5V, and  support true bipolar ±10.24V, ±5.12V, and ±2.56V inputs, as  well as unipolar input ranges of 0V to 10.24V and 0V to 5.12V.  The input range is configured by software.  These chips provide over-voltage protection up to ±20V at the  input.  These chips have an on-chip high accuracy and low drift  10ppm reference.  The input impedance of these chips is ~1MΩ and it is  independent of input range selection.  The digital interface is compatible to the traditional SPI  protocol.    "}'

The SGM51652H8  has 8 channels inputs. They both have a 16-bit 500kSPS  SAR ADC core. The interface is SPI-compatible serial  interface and supports with daisy-chain (DAISY) features.    Analog Inputs  The chip supports bipolar single-ended input, bipolar  differential input, and unipolar single-ended input.  When it works in bipolar single-ended input, tie the AIN_nN to  AGND (system ground), the signal applied to AIN_nP can be  bipolar ±2.5 × VREF, ±1.25 × VREF, and ±0.625 × VREF. Another  selection is that tie the AIN_nP to AGNG (system ground), the  signal applied to AIN_nN can be bipolar ±2.5 × VREF, ±1.25 ×  VREF, and ±0.625 × VREF.  When it works in unipolar single-ended input, tie the AIN_nN  to AGND (system ground), the signal applied to AIN_nP can  be unipolar 0 to 2.5 × VREF, and 0 to 1.25 × VREF.   When it works in bipolar differential input, then AIN_nN and  AIN_nP are differential inputs referring to AGND. For each pin,  the absolute voltage referring to AGND must be within the  limited voltage specified in electrical characteristic table, at  the same time, the differential voltage of AIN_nP-AIN_nN  must be compatible with the according input ranges. The  common mode voltage of AIN_nP and AIN_nN are limited in  according  input  ranges.  Please  refer  to  electrical  characteristic table. When the chip works in bipolar  differential input, the valid input ranges are bipolar ±2.5 ×  VREF, ±1.25 × VREF, and ±0.625 × VREF. The illustrative input  signals are shown in Figure 3, as shown in this example, if  input common mode voltage is not 0V, there will be some  dynamic range (ADC conversion code) losing accordingly.   The input voltage range is configured by software, and it can  be bipolar ±2.5 × VREF, ±1.25 × VREF, and ±0.625 × VREF or  unipolar 0 to 2.5 × VREF, and 0 to 1.25 × VREF. If there is a  reference voltage of 4.096V (internal or external), then the  input ranges of the device can be configured to bipolar ranges  of ±10.24V, ±5.12V, and ±2.56V, or unipolar ranges of 0V to  10.24V and 0V to 5.12V.    Analog Input Impedance  The input impedance of each channel is ≥ 1MΩ.    Input Over-Voltage Protection Circuit  The chip has input over-voltage protection (OVP) circuit.  Table 1 shows these characteristics.    Table 1. Input Over-Voltage Protection Limits when AVDD  = 5V (1)    Input Condition  (VOVP = ±20V)  ADC  Output  Comments  |VIN| < |VRANGE|  Valid  Work normally.  |VRANGE| < |VIN| < |VOVP|  Saturated  ADC output is saturated, and  the internal protection circuits  are on.  |VIN| > |VOVP|  Saturated  This may damage the chip.    NOTE: 1. AGND = 0V, |VRANGE| is the maximum input voltage  for any selected input range, and |VOVP| is the break-down  voltage for the internal OVP circuit. Assume that RS is  approximately 0Ω.    In the following condition, the input signal is applied before  analog AVDD is powered on or the input signal is applied and  keep analog AVDD is floating, the input OVP circuits will be  on. And if the input voltage exceeds the |VOVP|, the chip will  be damaged.

VP-P means peak-to-peak voltage.  Figure 3.

Besides setting the INPUT_FLOATING_DETECTION_EN  register, it also needs a pull-down resistor 10MΩ connected  to system ground (AGND), please refer to typical connection  in Figure 4. After setting INPUT_FLOATING_DETECTION  _EN register (see Table 16), the host needs to send the  manual mode command to continuously convert the channel  that needs floating detection. When the detected input is  floating, the corresponding bit in the INPUT_FLOATING_  DETECTION_STATUS register is set to 1 (see Table 17).  After the floating detection is completed, the bit in the  INPUT_FLOATING_DETECTION_EN register is automatically  set to 0 (see Table 16). If the detected input is given an input  signal source later, please repeat the above floating detection  steps. Then the INPUT_FLOATING_ DETECTION_STATUS  register referred bit can be cleared.  Note that, to perform a complete input floating detection,  there must be a consecutive 256 times conversions, which  cannot be interrupted by normal input sampling. At same time,  if there is still an input signal at input pin, the input floating  detection will report an untrusted result.     Programmable Gain Amplifier (PGA)  The chip has a programmable gain amplifier (PGA), and the  PGA gain can be adjusted by setting the RANGE_CHn[3:0] (n  = 0 to 3 or 0 to 7) bits in the configuration register (see the  Channel n Input Range Registers).

These two unipolar input ranges are only valid for  unipolar single-ended input with AIN_nN = AGND.    Multiplexer (MUX)  The maximum throughout data rate of scanning all channels  is 500kSPS. For the SGM51652H4, it means the maximum  data rate per channel is 125kSPS if all 4 channels are  enabled. For the SGM51652H8, it means the maximum data  rate per channel is 62.5kSPS if all 8 channels are enabled.  Please refer to Table 6 for details of auto-scan mode and  manual mode settings.

This AUX channel goes to ADC only through the  MUX. There is no PGA, driver or low pass filter in the AUX  channel.   The absolute input on AUX_INP and AUX_INN must be 0 to  VREF.

These two unipolar input ranges are only valid for  unipolar single-ended input with AIN_nN = AGND.    Device Functional Modes  nRST/nPD (Input)  nRST/nPD is a dual-function pin. The timing of this pin is  shown in Figure 6, and Table 4 explains the usage of this pin.        Figure 6. nRST/nPD Pin Timing      Table 4. nRST/nPD Pin Functionality  Condition  Device Mode  40ns < tPL_RST_PD ≤ 100ns The device goes into RESET mode.  100ns < tPL_RST_PD < 400ns  The device is in RESET mode and has  the possibility to go into PWR_DOWN  mode. Note that this setting is not  recommended.  tPL_RST_PD ≥ 400ns  The device goes into PWR_DOWN  mode and the program registers are  reset to default value.    The chip can be powered down by pulling nRST/nPD pin for  at least 400ns. And this operation is asynchronous to chip's  operation clock and working status. In power-down mode, the  chip has no response to any digital inputs except operating on  nRST/nPD pin.  When chip goes into RESET mode and PWR_DOWN mode,  the program registers are reset to default value.  When the nRST/nPD pin is pulled high again, the chip wakes  up and goes into a default state. To let the chip work correctly,  it must re-configure the program registers accordingly.           nRST/nPD tPL_RST_PD  SGM51652H4  16-Bit, 500kSPS, 4- and 8-Channel, Single-Supply,  SGM51652H8  SAR ADCs with Bipolar Input Ranges      24  DECEMBER 2022  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued)  Data Acquisition Example  This section briefly introduces how the chip works and  interfaces with the host controller. Figure 7 shows the timing  marks.  As shown in Figure 7, there are four events T1 ~ T4.  T1: The input signal is sampled at the moment of the nCS  falling edge. The ADC conversion is driven by internal  oscillator clock. The current ADC result is from the input  channel selected by previous data frame. The current SDI  data setting is for the next conversion. The SDO goes low  because of there is no ADC conversion result during the first  16 SCLK cycles.  T2: The conversion time is 16 SCLK cycles. Therefore, the  maximum SCLK frequency must be compliance with the  timing requirement (which is listed in Electrical Characteristics  table). Otherwise, if the conversion time is not enough, the  ADC conversion result is corrupt. The MSB of ADC result  starts to be shifted out on SDO at the 16th falling edge of  SCLK.  T3: After the 16th falling edge of the SCLK, the chip doesn't  read any more data on SDI. The host controller can read the  ADC result at every falling edge of the SCLK cycle which is  from 17th to 32nd. If there are more SCLK cycles, the SDO is  filled with 0 until next conversion is initiated.  T4: The host controller stops the data frame by pulling nCS  high. The SDO goes into 3-state until the next data frame  starts.    Daisy-Chain Topology  A typical connection diagram showing multiple devices in  daisy-chain mode is shown in Figure 8. The devices can enter  daisy-chain mode without any special hardware or software  configuration.      nCS SCLK SDO SDI 1 2 DI1 DI0 15 16 31 32 DO15 DO12 DO0 XX XX XX 17 18 DO1 Sample N Sample  N+1 DO14 DI15 DI14 XX T1 T2 T3 T4     Figure 7.

Daisy-Chain Connection Schematic       SGM51652H4  16-Bit, 500kSPS, 4- and 8-Channel, Single-Supply,  SGM51652H8  SAR ADCs with Bipolar Input Ranges      25  DECEMBER 2022  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued)  A typical timing diagram for three devices connected in  daisy-chain mode is shown in Figure 9.  As shown in the example, the three chips are connected in  daisy-chain mode in Figure 9. Each chip samples its  respective signal input on the falling edge of the nCS. At the  first 16 SCLK cycles, SDO outputs keep low. At the second  16 SCLK cycles, each chip outputs its ADC result to SDO,  and receives the data from DAISY pin. On every  subsequence SCLK cycle, the DAISY pin data is shifted in  and stored in internal register, and the chip shifts out the  internal shift register data to its SDO pin. In this example, 16 ×  3 = 48 SCLK cycles are required to shift all data to the tail  chip SDO pin. In total 64 SCLK cycles for all 3 chips to  conversion and shift out all data.    Device Modes  After power-up, the SGM51652H4 and SGM51652H8 stay in  IDLE state and don’t perform any function until a command  from the host controller.     Continued Operation in the Selected Mode (NO_OP)  If the chip receives a NO_OP command (0x0000), it will follow  the same settings which are already in the program registers.  The previous selected mode can be STDBY, PWR_DOWN,  AUTO_SCAN and MAN_CH_n.  If the NO_OP command (0x0000) occurs during any other  configure operation to the command register, the chip retains  the old settings of the program registers. Then the chip goes  back to IDLE state and waits for a new command.    Frame Abort Condition (FRAME_ABORT)  As shown in Data Acquisition Example section, a complete  command is at least composed of 16 SCLK cycles, and the  command is locked in at the falling of the 16th SCLK. If the  SCLK is not accumulated to 16, the chip keeps waiting and  the nCS must stay low all operation process. If the nCS goes  high before the command transmission is completed, the chip  goes to an invalid state. It will not skip out the invalid condition  until a new proper command is performed.

In STDBY mode, only parts of the circuits are  powered off, and they will take the chip about 20μs to exit the  STDBY mode. After getting out of the STDBY, the chip  program registers retain its customer's setting value.   As shown in Figure 10, issuing a STDBY command 0x8200,  the command will be valid and the chip goes into STDBY  mode on the rising edge of nCS. To exit STDBY mode, a valid  command AUTO_SCAN or MAN_CH_n must be issued and it  will be valid on the rising edge of nCS (see Figure 11). In the  STDBY mode, the program registers can be read or written.  But the chip doesn't do conversion, thus any conversion data  read back is invalid (more details in Program Register  Read/Write Operation section).  Figure 11 shows the command AUTO_SCAN or MAN_CH_n  can call the chip out of the STDBY mode. It is valid at the  rising edge of the nCS. It will take the chip about 30μs to fully  be ready to sample and do conversion after exiting STDBY  mode. It is necessary to hold nCS high at least 30μs before a  new data frame starting. On the next nCS falling edge, the  chip samples the input channel which is selected by  MAN_CH_n or the first channel of the AUTO_SCAN mode  sequence (more details refer to Figure 7).

The hardware power-down mode is  talked in the nRST/nPD section. When the chip is waked up  from software power-down, all previous settings of program  registers are retained. When the chip is waked up from  hardware power-down mode, all the registers are reset to  default values. It will take the chip about 15ms to fully power  up and ready to work after receiving wake up command  (AUTO_SCAN or MAN_CH_n).  As shown in Figure 12, issuing a PWR_DOWN command  0x8300, the command will be valid and the chip goes into  PWR_DOWN mode on the rising edge of nCS. To exit  PWR_DOWN mode, a valid command AUTO_SCAN or  MAN_CH_n must be issued and it will be valid on the rising  edge of nCS (See Figure 13). Being in the PWR_DOWN  mode, the program registers can be read or written. But the  chip doesn't do conversion, thus any conversion data read  back is invalid (more details in Program Register Read/Write  Operation section).  Figure 13 shows the command AUTO_SCAN or MAN_CH_n  can call the chip out of the PWR_DOWN mode. It is valid at  the rising edge of the nCS. It will take the chip about 15ms to  fully be ready to sample and do conversion after exiting  PWR_DOWN mode. It is necessary to hold nCS high at least  15ms before a new data frame starting. On the next nCS  falling edge, the chip samples the input channel which is  selected by MAN_CH_n or the first channel of the  AUTO_SCAN mode sequence (more details refer to Figure  8).

In  order to read every selected channel conversion result  correctly, each of the data frame must be at least 32 SCLK  cycles.  The selected channels which the chip goes through in  AUTO_SCAN mode is configured by the program register  0x01 and register 0x02 (please see the Program Register  Map section). In this mode, the chip goes through all selected  channels in ascending order from the lowest channel. When it  scans all channels, it will repeat the cycle from the lowest  channel. The input range of each channel can be configured  separately in the Range Select Registers.  An example is shown in Figure 15, during the AUTO_SCAN  operation sequence, if an AUTO_SCAN command is inserted,  the chip re-starts scanning from the lowest selected channel.  Figure 14 shows a scan sequence from channel 1 to channel  4 and an AUTO_SCAN command is inserted after channel 3  conversion.         Figure 14.

In order to read every selected  channel conversion result correctly, each of the data frame  must be at least 32 SCLK cycles. Refer to Table 5 for a list of  commands of MAN_CH_n mode.  An example is shown in Figure 17, if there is no other new  valid command, the chip will keep sampling the current  channel selected by MAN_CH_n. The input range of each  channel can be configured separately in the Range Select  Registers. Figure 17 shows an example MAN_CH_3 to  MAN_CH_1 in manual select mode.          Figure 16.

In AUTO_SCAN mode, the chip goes through all selected  channels in ascending order from the lowest channel.   In MAN_CH_n mode, the chip samples the same input  channel if there is no new command input. If a new input  channel is selected by MAN_CH_n command, then the new  selected channel is sampled in the next data frame. Figure 18  shows an example channel sequence switching from  AUTO_SCAN (channel 2, 3, 5 are selected) to MAN_CH_n  (MAN_CH_4).  Figure 19 shows an example channel sequence switching  from MAN_CH_n (MAN_CH_5) to AUTO_SCAN (channel 2,  3, 5 are selected). A new command is executed in the next  operation frame.

In both cases, all program registers are  reset to default values. The hardware reset is explained in  nRST/nPD section.  As shown in Figure 20, a valid RST command can be issued  during any data frame. After receiving the RST command, the  chip reset all program registers on the rising edge of nCS. In  the RESET mode, the program registers can be read or  written. But the chip doesn't do conversion, thus any  conversion data read back is invalid (more details in Program  Register Read/Write Operation section).  An AUTO_SCAN command or a MAN_CH_n command can  call the chip out of RESET mode. To initiate a conversion on  a particular analog channel, a valid AUTO_SCAN or  MAN_CH_n command must be executed using the default  program register settings.    Input Floating Detection Function Operating  Sequences  The device provides a function to detect input floating. To  perform this function, it is necessary to follow the operations  as bellow.   Step1: Change to manual mode, and selected target channel  n by MAN_CH_n command.  Step2: Write 0x80 to INPUT FLOATING_DETECTION_EN  Register (address is 0x0D, see Table 16).  Step3: Perform consecutive 256 times of conversions. Note  that, to perform a complete input floating detection, there  must be a consecutive 256 times conversions, it can’t be  interrupted by normal input sampling. At same time, if there is  still an input signal at input pin, the input floating detection will  report an untrusted result.  Step4: Read INPUT FLOATING_DETECTION_STATUS  Register (address is 0x0E, see Table 17). Note that the alarm  bit in INPUT_FLOATING_DETECTION_STATUS register will  not be cleared, until an input floating detection operation is  performed again and the inputs of ADC are connected with an  input signal source.

All the operations of channel 7 to channel 4 are not applicable to the 4-channel version chip. A write operation on any of these  bits or registers has no effect on chip behavior. A read operation on any of these bits or registers outputs all '1' on the SDO line.  2. A channel is not powered down, if this channel is supposed to be scanned in AUTO_SCAN sequence, it is necessary to enable  the corresponding bit in AUTO_SEQ_EN Register at same time.
