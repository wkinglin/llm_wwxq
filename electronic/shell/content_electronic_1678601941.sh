These ADCs are powered by a single unipolar 5V, and  support true bipolar ±10.24V, ±5.12V, and ±2.56V  inputs, as well as unipolar input ranges of 0V to 10.24V  and 0V to 5.12V. The input range is configured by  software.  These chips provide over-voltage protection at input,  which is up to ±20V.  These chips have an on-chip high accuracy and low  drift 10ppm reference.  The input impedance of these chips is ~1MΩ and it is  independent of the input range selection.  The digital interface is compatible to the traditional SPI  protocol.  The SGM51613H, SGM51652H, and SGM51622H are  available in Green TSSOP-16 and TQFN-4×4-16L  packages. They are all specified from -40℃ to +125℃.      "}'

The input common mode voltage range is guaranteed by design, and tested by limited samples, and not covered by  manufacture testing. When the input common mode voltage exceeds ±100mV, the critical DC and AC performances are not  guaranteed.  4. This is best-fit INL.  5. Bipolar ranges are ±10.24V, ±5.12V, and ±2.56V, only tested in singled-ended input.  6. Unipolar ranges are 0V to 10.24V and 0V to 5.12V, only tested in singled-ended input.  7. Measured relative to actual measured reference.  8. Excludes internal reference accuracy error.  9. Excludes internal reference temperature drift.  10. All specifications expressed in decibels (dB) refer to the full-scale input (FSR) and are tested with a 1kHz input signal 0.25dB  below full-scale, unless otherwise specified.  11. Calculated on the first nine harmonics of the input frequency.  12. Extended functional range limits are set by sample characterization across the temperature range.

When it works in bipolar single-ended input, tie the AIN_N to  AGND (system ground), the signal applied to AIN_P can be  bipolar ±2.5 × VREF, ±1.25 × VREF, and ±0.625 × VREF. Another  selection is that tie the AIN_P to AGNG (system ground), the  signal applied to AIN_N can be bipolar ±2.5 × VREF, ±1.25 ×  VREF, and ±0.625 × VREF.  When it works in unipolar single-ended input, tie the AIN_N to  AGND (system ground), the signal applied to AIN_P can be  unipolar 0 to 2.5 × VREF, and 0 to 1.25 × VREF.  When it works in bipolar differential input, then AIN_N and  AIN_P are differential inputs referring to AGND. For each pin,  the absolute voltage referring to AGND must be within the  limited voltage specified in electrical characteristic table, at  same time, the differential voltage of AIN_P-AIN_N must be  compatible with the according input ranges. The common  mode voltage of AIN_P and AIN_N are limited in according  input ranges. Please refer to electrical characteristic table.  When the chip works in bipolar differential input, the valid  input ranges are bipolar ±2.5 × VREF, ±1.25 × VREF, and  ±0.625 × VREF. The illustrative input signals are shown in  Figure 6, as shown in this example, if input common mode  voltage is not 0V, there will be some dynamic range (ADC  conversion code) losing accordingly.   The input voltage range is configured by software, and it can  be bipolar ±2.5 × VREF, ±1.25 × VREF, and ±0.625 × VREF or  unipolar 0 to 2.5 × VREF, and 0 to 1.25 × VREF. If there is a  reference voltage of 4.096V (internal or external), then the  input ranges of the device can be configured to bipolar ranges  of ±10.24V, ±5.12V, and ±2.56V or unipolar ranges of 0V to  10.24V, and 0V to 5.12V.    Analog Input Impedance  The input impedance of each channel is ~1MΩ.    Input Over-Voltage Protection Circuit  The chip has the input over-voltage protection (OVP) circuit.  Table 1 shows these characteristics.  In the following condition, the input signal is applied before  analog AVDD is powered on or the input signal is applied and  keep analog AVDD floating, the input OVP circuits will be on.  And if the input voltage exceeds the |VOVP|, the chip will be  damaged.    Input Floating Detection Function  The device features an input floating detection function, when  this function is enabled by setting INPUT_FLOATING  _DETECTION_EN register corresponding bit. Besides setting  the INPUT_FLOATING_DETECTION_EN register, it also  needs a pull-down resistor 10MΩ connected to system  ground (GND), please refer to typical connection in Figure 7.  If perform an input floating detection operating sequences  when the input is floating, the corresponding bit in the  INPUT_FLOATING_DETECTION_STATUS register is set to  '1'. The detailed sequence of operations is shown in Figure  11.  Note that, to perform a complete input floating detection,  there must be a consecutive 256 times conversions, which  cannot be interrupted by normal input sampling. At same time,  if there is still an input signal at input pin, the input floating  detection will report an untrusted result.    Table 1.

NOTE: 1. AGND = 0V, |VRANGE| is the maximum input voltage for any selected input range, and |VOVP| is the break-down voltage  for the internal OVP circuit. Assume that RS is approximately 0Ω.

These two unipolar input ranges are only valid for  unipolar single-ended input with AIN_N = AGND.    Alarm Features  The chip has an active-high alarm output function on the  ALARM/SDO-1/GPO pin if the pin is used for ALARM output.  There are two types of alarms: the input alarm and the AVDD  alarm.  When each conversion ends, the ALARM output flags are  updated internally. The ALARM output flags can be read out  in 3 kinds of way. Firstly it can be read by the ALARM output  pin, secondly read the internal ALARM registers, thirdly  append the ALARM flags to the data output.    Input Alarm  The chip has input low and input high alarm. These alarms  have a common hysteresis window which can be set by  ALARM_HIGH_THRES and ALARM_LOW_THRES registers.   Please see the trigged function diagrams in Figure 9 and  Figure 10.  H_ALARM On H_ALARM Off High Lower Limit High Upper Limit ADC Output Alarm Threshold     Figure 9.

Low ALARM Hysteresis    AVDD Alarm  If the AVDD exceeds 5.35V (TYP) or drops below 4.62V  (TYP), there is an AVDD alarm.     SPI Connection Topologies  Single Device: Standard SPI Interface  The chip supports a standard SPI protocol and connection.    Multiple Devices: Daisy-Chain Topology  The chip supports the daisy-chain connection.    Device Operational Modes  The chip supports three functional states: RESET, Acquisition,  and Conversion. The state is determined by the status of the  CONVST/nCS and RST control signals.    RESET State  To issue a RESET, the nRST pin must be pulled low and kept  low for a specified time (see Timing Characteristics in Figure  2). The chip has two different reset functions: an application  reset and a power-on reset (POR). The function of the nRST  pin is determined by the state of the RSTn_APP bit in the  RESET_POWER_CONTROL register.  To issue an application reset, the RSTn_APP bit must be set  to 1. In this RESET status, according configuration registers  are reset to the default values (please refer to registers  descriptions, note that an application reset is not as same as  power-on reset), the RADC_ADCS pin keeps low, and the  SDO-x pins are tri-stated.  To issue a power-on reset, the RSTn_APP bit is set to 0. In  POR status, all internal circuits of the chip (including the PGA,  ADC driver, and voltage reference) are reset.   To exit the RESET status, pull the nRST pin high while keep  the CONVST/nCS and SCLK pins low.  Acquisition State  The chip enters acquisition state after system powers up, or  after reset, or at the end of every conversion.    Conversion State  On the rising edge of CONVST/nCS signal, the chip transits  from acquisition state to conversion state. The conversion  process is driven by the internal clock. During the conversion,  the chip is not response to CONVST/nCS signal. See the  timing table, under the different sampling speed, the minimum  sampling time and conversion time must be met.            SGM51613H  16-Bit, High-Speed, Programmable  SGM51652H/SGM51622H  Bipolar Input Ranges, SAR ADC      25  MARCH 2023    SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued)  Digital Interface Operation (SPI Interface  Operation)  Data Transfer Frame  For a typical data transfer frame, the controller pulls  CONVST/nCS low to initiate the data transfer frame.   At the end of the data transfer frame:  • If the SCLK counter = 32, the chip treats the frame as a valid  operation.   • If the SCLK counter is < 32, the chip treats the frame as an  invalid operation. In a write operation, the command is  ignored. In a read operation, the according number of MSB  bits is shifted from 32-bit register.  • If the SCLK counter is > 32, the chip treats the frame as a  long frame operation. The last 32 bits is accepted before the  CONVST/nCS rising edge.    Input Command Word and Register Write Operation  The chip supports one byte or two bytes (equivalent to half a  word) operation. Table 4 lists the input commands. In a single  operation, the command composed of two types is marked by  HWORD (Half of a WORD).   In an HWORD command, the LSB bit of 9-bit address is  treated as 0. For example, whether the address is  0b000010000 or 0b000010001, the chip executes the  command with the address 0b000010000.      Table 4. Input Commands List  OPCODE Bit [31:0]  Command  Description  00000000_000000000_  00000000_00000000  NOP  No operation.  11000_xx_<9-bit address>_  <16-bit data> (1)  CLEAR_HWORD  Clear Any Bits of a Register  16-bit data, DB[15:0], DB[x] = 1, means that clear the specified bit to '0' in the address  register.

DB[x] = 0, means unchanged.  All other input command  combinations  NOP  No operation.    NOTE:   1. <9-bit address> is composed of MSB '0' and an 8-bit register address (which is shown in Table 8). For example, the <9-bit  address> for register 0x08 is 0b000001000.

If DATA_VAL[2:0] is set to 1xx, the data format is  described in the DATAOUT_CONTROL register. If a READ  command is in frame N, the output of frame N+1 is 8-bit  register data and others followed by '0'. If a READ_HWORD  command is in frame N, the output of frame N+1 is 16-bit  register data and others followed by '0'.  For the other combinations, the frame N+1 is composed of  16-bit ADC conversion result and various of data flag  (depends on the setting of the DATAOUT_CONTROL  register). If all flags are enabled, they are in the following  sequence: DEVICE_ADDR, AVDD ALARM FLAGS, INPUT  ALARM FLAGS, ADC INPUT RANGE FLAGS, PARITY, and  all remaining bits are set to 0, see Table 5 for an example. If  only some flags are enabled, an example is shown in Table 6.    Table 5.

Input Floating Detection Function Operating  Sequences  The device provides a function to detect input floating. To  perform this function, it is necessary to follow the operations  as  bellows.  Firstly,  enable  the  control  bit  in  the  INPUT_FLOATING_DETECTION_EN register (see Table 18).  Secondly, perform 256 times of conversion. The control bit in  the INPUT_FLOATING_DETECTION_EN register will reset  automatically after ADC converts 256 times. In the process of  256 conversions, if there is no input floating default, all  conversion data are normal conversion results which can be  used for user. Thirdly, read the status bit in the  INPUT_FLOATING_DETECTION_STATUS  register  (see  Table  19).  Note  that  the  alarm  bit  in  the  INPUT_FLOATING_DETECTION_STATUS register will not  be cleared, until an input floating detection operation is  performed again and the input of ADC is connected to an  input signal source.
