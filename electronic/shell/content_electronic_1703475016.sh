The device consumes  only 1.2μA (MAX) quiescent current. It features a 60μV  (MAX) low offset voltage, which allows for 12-bit  resolution at a very low 50mV full-scale current  measurement. The device can sense the voltage  across a current-sense resistor in a common mode  voltage range from 1.6V to 28V. The SGM8193 series  provides four fixed gains: 25V/V, 50V/V, 100V/V and  200V/V, which allows flexible selection of the external  current-sense resistor.  The SGM8193 is available in Green SOT-23-5 and  WLCSP-1×1-4B packages. The tiny packages make  the device an excellent choice for portable and battery-  powered applications, where the size is limited. The  SGM8193 is rated over the -40 ℃ to +125 ℃  temperature range.    "}'

This common mode voltage range  allows measuring of a 1.8V battery system. The load  current that flows through the external resistor RSENSE  generates a corresponding sense voltage that is  amplified by the current sensing monitor.  The internal amplifier will force the load current through  the resistor R1 such that the voltage drop over R1 is  equal to the sense voltage across the external resistor.  To minimize the offset voltage, there is also a resistor  connecting to the positive input of the internal  operational amplifier. The PMOS, which is integrated  inside the device, forces the current through R1 to also  flow through ROUT, such that VOUT is equal to ILOAD ×  RSENSE × ROUT/R1. Therefore, the two resistors R1 and  ROUT will determine the gain, which for the SGM8193A0  is set to 25V/V, for the SGM8193A1 is set to 50V/V, for  the SGM8193A2 is set to 100V/V and for the SGM8193A3  is set to 200V/V (see Table 1). The output current-limit  and a 6V clamp protection circuit are used for  protecting the output from input overdrive.    Table 1.

RSENSE Voltage Loss  Due to Ohm’s Law, the voltage drop across RSENSE will  be increased if the customer prefers higher RSENSE.  However, for obtaining the minimum voltage drop, the  lowest RSENSE should be taken into account.    OUT Swing vs. VRS+ and VSENSE  The SGM8193 is powered through its RS+ pin, which  means that there is no supply voltage pin. Therefore,  the maximum output swing value is limited by the  minimum voltage level of RS+.  VOUT(MAX) = VRS+(MIN) - VSENSE(MAX) - VOH       (1)  ( ) ( ) × OUT MAX SENSE LOAD MAX V R = G  I                 (2)  Moreover, when the SGM8193 is powered by a 3.6V  power supply, the largest dynamic range will be  achieved if RSENSE is chosen such that the maximum  VSENSE voltage is 120mV (gain of 25V/V), 60mV (gain of  50V/V), 30mV (gain of 100V/V) or 15mV (gain of  200V/V).    Accuracy  Within the linear region of the SGM8193 (VOUT <  VOUT(MAX)), the input offset voltage and the gain error  are the two main issues that affect the accuracy of the  output voltage. For the SGM8193, the offset voltage  VOS is 10μV (TYP) and the gain error (GE) is ±0.15%  (TYP). The following equation illustrates the actual  output voltage according to the gain error and offset  voltage:  VOUT = (G ± GE) × VSENSE ± (G × VOS)        (3)  It is recommended to use a larger RSENSE when  measuring a small load current, as this minimizes the  effect of the input offset voltage on the output error.    Efficiency and Power Dissipation  If the current level is increasing, the I2R loss will be  increased. So the trade-off between power dissipation  and the value of resistor is significant. In addition, the  resistance will be changed if the corresponding  temperature is higher due to the power dissipation. The  SGM8193 allows using lower external resistor so that  the power dissipation and the hot spots are decreased  dramatically.    Kelvin Connections  The current flowing through the RSENSE will be  significantly high, so that the external voltage drop  caused by the PCB trace should also be considered.  Use the sense resistor with four terminals or use Kelvin  connections.    Optional Output Filter Capacitor  For the sample and hold stage in the ADC, the  sampling capacitor would instantly load the output of  the SGM8193 and thusly the output voltage will be  decreased. If the sampling time of the ADC is short  (less than 1µs), the ceramic capacitor will keep the  output voltage stable. Also, the small signal bandwidth  and the corresponding noise are also reduced by using  an additional capacitor at the output stage of the  SGM8193.
