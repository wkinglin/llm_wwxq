For  VREF1, the typical operation range is from 1.2V to 3.3V and the  typical operation for VREF2 is from 1.8V to 5.5V.  The signal can be transmitted bilaterally from 1.2V to 5V. The  propagation delay is significant small as the low on-resistance  of SGM4551B. Also, if the EN pin is in high position, the  voltage translator is transparent and then it allows the  connection between SCL1 and SCL2, SDA1 and SDA2  respectively. In addition, in this state, the transmitting  direction is bidirectional. However, the transmitting will be  suspended if the EN pin is in low state as the high-impedance  property at this moment.  For the applications, the connections of the devices and bus  length are limited as the 400pF capacitance of the bus pin.  However, SGM4551B allows the isolation between two sides  of I2C bus so that more and more I2C devices can be added  and connected with SGM4551B.  Two different kinds of bus frequencies are supported by  SGM4551B, one is 400kHz and the other is 100kHz. Also, if  two frequencies for the buses are required, the priority of  400kHz should be always higher than that of 100kHz.  Because of the adding of the additional delay, the operational  frequency of the device must be lower than 400kHz if the  frequency of the master is equal to 400kHz.  For the application of standard I2C, the pull-up resistor is  required for the logic high levels, which means that the  operation for I2C in this case is open-drain. Each side of the  repeater requires a pull-up resistor and the value of resistor  depends on the operation of SGM4551B. Also, when multiple  masters are connected with SGM4551B, the standard  operation current is 3mA, and high current can be taken into  account under the specific conditions.  The resistance between SDA1 and SDA2 is low when the  state of them is low. However, if the state of SDA1 or SDA2 is  high, the level of high position depends on the corresponding  voltage reference. In the transparent mode, when the position  of SDA1 is high, SDA2 must be pulled to a high level through  the pull-up resistor. In addition, the transition for high and low  voltage is seamless which can be selected by the users.   Because of the same electrical characteristics for all the  outputs of SGM4551B, so that the deviations of the  propagation delay and voltage is extremely small. In addition,  this advantage is good for the transition of discrete transistors  as the symmetrical switch inside SGM4551B. On top of this,  SGM4551B can also provide the protection of ESD for the  devices with weak ESD ability.  The SGM4551B is available in a Green SOT-23-8 package. It  operates over an ambient temperature range of -40℃ to  +85℃.
