These features make the device a reliable solution to  solve many challenging problems in the generation of  clean  and  accurate  power  supply.  The  high  performance also makes the SGM2207 useful in a  variety of applications. The SGM2207 provides  protection functions for output overload, output  short-circuit condition and overheating.  The SGM2207 provides an EN pin as an external chip  enable control to enable/disable the device.    Input Capacitor Selection (CIN)  The input decoupling capacitor should be placed as  close as possible to the VIN pin for ensuring the device  stability. 1μF or larger X7R or X5R ceramic capacitor is  selected to get good dynamic performance.  When VIN is required to provide large current  instantaneously, a large effective input capacitor is  required. Multiple input capacitors can limit the input  tracking inductance. Adding more input capacitors is  available to restrict the ringing and to keep it below the  device absolute maximum ratings.    Output Capacitor Selection (COUT)  The output capacitor should be placed as close as  possible to the VOUT pin. 2.2μF or larger X7R or X5R  ceramic capacitor is selected to get good dynamic  performance. The minimum effective capacitance of  COUT that SGM2207 can remain stable is 1μF. For  ceramic capacitor, temperature, DC bias and package  size will change the effective capacitance, so enough  margin of COUT must be considered in design.  Additionally, COUT with larger capacitance and lower  ESR will help increase the high frequency PSRR and  improve the load transient response.    Adjustable Regulator  The output voltage of the SGM2207 can be adjusted  from 1.8V to 15V. The ADJ pin will be connected to two  external resistors as shown in Figure 3, the output voltage  is determined by the following equation:    = ×    1 OUT REF 2 R V V 1+R              (1)  where:  VOUT is output voltage and VREF is the internal voltage  reference, VREF = 1.235V.  SGM2207 VIN VOUT VIN GND EN ADJ VOUT R1 R2 CFF 4.7pF CIN 1μF COUT 2.2μF   Figure 3. Adjustable Output Voltage Application    Choose R2 = 150kΩ to maintain an about 8μA minimum  load. R1 and R2 can be calculated for any output  voltage range using equation 1 and R1 is recommended  to be less than 470kΩ.    Enable Operation  The EN pin of the SGM2207 is used to enable/disable  the device and to deactivate/activate the output  automatic discharge function.  When the EN pin voltage is lower than 0.4V, the device  is in shutdown state. There is no current flowing from  VIN to VOUT pins. In this state, the automatic discharge  transistor is active to discharge the output voltage  through a resistor.  When the EN pin voltage is higher than 1.2V, the device  is in active state. The output voltage is regulated to  expected value and the automatic discharge transistor  is turned off.    No-Load Stability  The SGM2207 can maintain stability without output  load (except internal voltage divider).    Input Power Supply  The input power supply range is from 2.5V to 20V. VIN  must be larger than (VOUT + VDROP) in application. The  input ceramic capacitor must be placed as close as  possible to the VIN pin, this CIN can help improve the  output noise performance of LDO.         800mA, High Voltage, Low Noise  SGM2207  and Low Dropout Voltage Regulator      10  JUNE 2022  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued)  Output Current Limit and Short-Circuit  Protection  When overload events happen, the output current is  internally limited to 1100mA (TYP). When the VOUT pin  is shorted to ground, the short-circuit protection will limit  the output current to 230mA (TYP).    Power Dissipation (PD)  Thermal protection limits power dissipation in the  SGM2207. When power dissipation on pass element  (PD = (VIN - VOUT) × IOUT) is too much and the operating  junction temperature exceeds +155℃, the OTP circuit  starts the thermal shutdown function and turns the pass  element off.  Therefore, thermal analysis for the chosen application is  important to guarantee reliable performance over all  conditions. To guarantee reliable operation, the junction  temperature of the SGM2207 must not exceed +125℃.  The maximum allowable power dissipation depends on  the thermal resistance of the IC package, the PCB  layout, the rate of surrounding airflow, and the  difference between the junction temperature and  ambient temperature. The maximum power dissipation  can be approximated using the following equation:  PD(MAX) = (TJ(MAX) - TA)/θJA             (2)  where TJ(MAX) is the maximum junction temperature, TA  is the ambient temperature, and θJA is the junction  -to-ambient thermal resistance.    Layout Guidelines  To get good PSRR, low output noise and high transient  response performance, the input and output bypass  capacitors must be placed as close as possible to the  VIN pin and VOUT pin separately. VIN and VOUT had  better use separate ground planes and these ground  planes are single point connected to the GND pin.                              "}'
