It can be powered from a  single-cell Lithium-Ion/polymer battery or a DC supply  in the range of 2.7V to 4.8V to provide OVDD, OVSS  and AVDD voltage sources for an AMOLED panel. Two  interim voltage rails (positive and negative) are  generated by the integrated adaptive ×1/×1.5 charge  pump converter and an inverting charge pump inverter.  These rails are regulated by LDOs to get clean and low  ripple positive (AVDD and OVDD) and negative (OVSS)  outputs. This device is optimized for symmetric output  to get highest efficiency from the charge pump inverter.  The SGM38045 is available in a Green WLCSP-  1.2×2.4-17B package.    "}'

ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION  This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are  not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all  integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions.  Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures  can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle  performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision  integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage  because even small parametric changes could cause the  device not to meet the published specifications.

The main blocks include a ×1/×1.5 positive  charge pump converter, a charge pump inverter, three  LDOs, the sequence control and protection functions.  This device provides three power lines to drive an  AMOLED panel. The power train is optimized for  symmetric output voltage on the adjustable OVDD and  OVSS. With a symmetric output, the charge pump  operates with an excellent efficiency. The OVDD  voltage is adjustable from 2.8V to 3.5V and the OVSS  voltage can be set from -3.5V to -2.8V both in 100mV  steps. After the device is enabled by pulling the  AVDDEN high, the positive charge pump converter  generates a stable positive rail (VOP) from the 3.6V to  4.8V power input source (VIN). Then the charge pump  converter generates a stable negative rail (VON) by  inverting VVOP (see Table 5 for details). Three LDOs,  two positive (AVDD and OVDD) and one negative  (OVSS) regulate the converters outputs to get clean  voltage sources needed for the AMOLED.  When the input voltage is high enough, the positive  charge pump operates in bypass mode, and the output  voltage VVOP is equal to the input voltage. If the input  voltage is not high enough, the VVOP is automatically  decided  based  on  the  headroom  needed  for  maintaining the regulation of the VAVDD, VOVDD and  VOVSS, as specified in the following equation:  VVOP = MAX(VAVDD, VOVDD, |VOVSS|) + 0.3V  The device can be shut down by pulling both AVDDEN  and SWIRE inputs to logic low. Supply current is less  than 1µA in shutdown state.  Protection Features  UVLO protection is provided for VIN to shut down the  device and prevent abnormal operation in case of  under-voltage.  The input current is monitored cycle-by-cycle during  each switch ON period for over-current limiting (OCP).  This current is sensed by the ON voltage across the  switches. When an over-current is detected on a switch,  it is forced off right away to limit the current and prevent  damage.  A short-circuit is detected when an output voltage falls  to less than 80% of its programmed value (typical).  Short-circuit protection (SCP) will force all switches off  upon detecting a short, including short to ground, short  to VIN and short in flying capacitors. The device enters  the shutdown state after SCP, and the shutdown state  is latched. To reset the whole device, either VIN has to  cycle below UVLO threshold or AVDDEN and SWIRE  have to be low at the same time for tOFF_DLY.  Over-Temperature Protection (OTP) stops all power  converters if the die temperature exceeds +140℃.  Device operation will resume when the die is cooled  down by 10℃ approximately.  The Positive Charge Pump Converter  The SGM38045 uses positive charge pump converter  to maintain synchronous power conversion under all  operating conditions to achieve high efficiency over a  wide range of input voltages and output currents. This  converter is internally compensated and can change its  mode automatically between ×1 bypass mode and ×1.5  charge pump mode based on the operating conditions.  If VIN > VVOP it operates in bypass mode, and it acts in  ×1.5 charge pump mode if VIN < VVOP. The RMS current  through the switches is thus kept to a minimum,  minimizing  switching  and  conduction  losses.  Controlling the switches this way lets the converter  achieve high efficiency over the whole input voltage  range.  Startup and Shutdown Sequences  Figure 3 to Figure 7 show the timing diagrams of the  startup and shutdown sequence options for the  SGM38045. The startup and shutdown sequence  depends on the order of AVDDEN and SWIRE rising  and falling edges after VIN reaches to its normal  operating range.  SWIRE I/F and Voltage/State Programming  SWIRE can also be used for programming the output  voltages by an MCU or a digital controller. VOVDD and  VOVSS can be programmed by the pulse counting in  SWIRE timing sequence. VVOP and VVON are adjusted  accordingly by the device for best efficiency and  regulation. Figure 8 shows transition timings of the  SWIRE in a pulse counting command session. The  SWIRE must be kept high for the minimum tSTOP time to  complete the command and apply that to the device. If  the SWIRE is kept low for more than tOFF_DLY time, the  relevant converters will shut down and the OVDD and  OVSS outputs go to discharge to ground state or Hi-Z  according to Table 3. An internal pull-down resistor on  the SWIRE assures that all outputs are shutdown when  the host is not active.       Charge Pump Mode Power Supply  SGM38045  for Wearable AMOLED Products        14  MAY 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued)  Layout and Component Selection  To achieve the best performance of the SGM38045, the  following layout guidelines must be followed.  To get a good output regulation, place the components  as close as possible to the device and use wide and  short traces for connections especially for the high  current loops in the outputs. The input and output  bypass capacitors should be connected to the ground  plane of the PCB. If the flying capacitors are not placed  close to the CFxP/CFxN pins, it may cause noise  radiation.  Refer to Figure 9 for a layout reference. Recommended  component values are given in Table 1 and Table 2.  Thermal Dissipation Constraint  Small size AMOLED panels are typically used in the  tiny, space constraint gadgets. They have limited  permissible thermal dissipation due to the close contact  with the user body. The thermal shutdown threshold of  the device is +140℃, which is way higher than the  allowed scald-free temperature. Therefore, careful  thermal dissipation analysis and tests are essential for  the evaluation of the designs in such applications. The  required thermal isolation causes higher operating  junction temperature compared to the operation in the  open space. Therefore, the device output power  capacity must be derated accordingly.          Figure 9.
