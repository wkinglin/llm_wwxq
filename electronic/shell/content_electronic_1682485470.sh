These ADCs are powered by a single unipolar 5V, and  support true differential input.  These chips have an on-chip high accuracy and low  drift 10ppm reference.  The digital interface is compatible to the traditional SPI  protocol.  The SGM51613D, SGM51652D, and SGM51622D are  available in Green TSSOP-16 and TQFN-4×4-16L  packages. They are all specified from -40℃ to +125℃.  "}'

ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION  This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are  not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all  integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions.  Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures  can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle  performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision  integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage  because even small parametric changes could cause the  device not to meet the published specifications.

There are two types of alarms: the input alarm and the AVDD  alarm.  When each conversion ends, the ALARM output flags are  updated internally. The ALARM output flags can be read out  in 3 kinds of way. Firstly it can be read by the ALARM output  pin, secondly read the internal ALARM registers, thirdly  append the ALARM flags to the data output.  Input Alarm  The chip has input low and input high alarm. These alarms  have a common hysteresis window which can be set by  ALARM_HIGH_THRES and ALARM_LOW_THRES registers.  Please see the trigged function diagrams in Figure 7 and  Figure 8.  H_ALARM On H_ALARM Off High Lower Limit High Upper Limit ADC Output Alarm Threshold     Figure 7.

Low ALARM Hysteresis    AVDD Alarm  If AVDD exceeds 5.35V (TYP) or drops below 4.62V (TYP),  there is an AVDD alarm.     SPI Connection Topologies  Single Device: Standard SPI Interface  The chip supports a standard SPI protocol and connection.    Multiple Devices: Daisy-Chain Topology  The chip supports the daisy-chain connection.    Device Operational Modes  The chip supports three functional states: RESET, Acquisition,  and Conversion. The state is determined by the status of the  CONVST/nCS and RST control signals.    RESET State  To issue a RESET, the nRST pin must be pulled low and kept  low for a specified time (see Timing Characteristics in Figure  2). The chip has two different reset functions: an application  reset and a power-on reset (POR). The function of the nRST  pin is determined by the state of the RSTn_APP bit in the  RESET_POWER_CONTROL register.         SGM51613D  16-Bit, High-Speed,  SGM51652D/SGM51622D  True Differential Input, SAR ADC      19  APRIL 2023    SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued)  To issue an application reset, the RSTn_APP bit must be set  to 1. In this RESET status, according configuration registers  are reset to the default values (please refer to registers  descriptions, note that an application reset is not as same as  power-on reset), the RADC_ADCS pin keeps low, and the  SDO-x pins are tri-stated.  To issue a power-on reset, the RSTn_APP bit is set to 0. In  POR status, all internal circuits of the chip (including the PGA,  ADC driver, and voltage reference) are reset.   To exit the RESET status, pull the nRST pin high while keep  CONVST/nCS and SCLK pins low.    Acquisition State  The chip enters acquisition state after system powers up, or  at the end of every conversion.    Conversion State  On the rising edge of CONVST/nCS signal, the chip transits  from acquisition state to conversion state. The conversion  process is driven by internal clock. During the conversion,  chip is not response to CONVST/nCS signal. See the timing  table, under the different sampling speed, the minimum  sampling time and conversion time must be met.   Digital Interface Operation (SPI Interface  Operation)  Data Transfer Frame  For a typical data transfer frame, the controller pulls  CONVST/nCS low to initiate the data transfer frame.   At the end of the data transfer frame:  • If the SCLK counter = 32, the chip treats the frame as a valid  operation.   • If the SCLK counter is < 32, the chip treats the frame as an  invalid operation. In a write operation, the command is  ignored. In a read operation, the according number of MSB  bits is shifted from 32-bit register.  • If the SCLK counter is > 32, the chip treats the frame as a  long frame operation. The last 32 bits is accepted before the  CONVST/nCS rising edge.    Input Command Word and Register Write Operation  The chip supports one byte or two bytes (equivalent to half a  word) operation. Table 2 lists the input commands. In a single  operation, the command composed of two types is marked by  HWORD (Half of a WORD).   In an HWORD command, the LSB bit of 9-bit address is  treated as 0. For example, whether the address is  0b000010000 or 0b000010001, the chip execute the  command with the address 0b000010000.    Table 2. Input Commands List  OPCODE Bit [31:0]  Command  Description  00000000_000000000_  00000000_00000000  NOP  No operation.  11000_xx_<9-bit address>_  <16-bit data> (1)  CLEAR_HWORD  Clear Any Bits of a Register  16-bit data, DB[15:0], DB[x] = 1, means that clear the specified bit to '0' in the address  register.

DB[x] = 0, means unchanged.  All other input command  combinations  NOP  No operation.    NOTE: 1. <9-bit address> is composed of MSB '0' and an 8-bit register address (which is shown in Table 6). For example, the  <9-bit address> for register 0x08 is 0b000001000.

If DATA_VAL[2:0] is set to 1xx, the data format is  described in the DATAOUT_CONTROL register. If a READ  command is in frame N, the output of frame N+1 is 8-bit  register data and others followed by '0'. If a READ_HWORD  command is in frame N, the output of frame N+1 is 16-bit  register data and others followed by '0'.  For the other combinations, the frame N+1 is composed of  16-bit ADC conversion result and various of data flag  (depends on the setting of the DATAOUT_CONTROL  register). If all flags are enabled, they are in the following  sequence DEVICE_ADDR, AVDD ALARM FLAGS, INPUT  ALARM FLAGS, ADC INPUT RANGE FLAGS, PARITY, and  all remaining bits are set to 0, see Table 3 for an example. If  only some flags are enabled, an example is shown in Table 4.    Table 3.

After system  power-on or reset, the default mode is SPI-00-S (CPHA = 0  and CPOL = 0).    Protocols for Reading from the Device  The data read operation protocols are roughly divided into  two types: one is SPI-compatible protocols with a single  SDO-x, and the other is SPI-compatible protocols with dual  SDO-x.    SPI-Compatible Protocols with a Single SDO-x  As shown in Table 5, the chip supports all 4 types of SPI  protocols.
