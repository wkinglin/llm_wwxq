OVERSTRESS CAUTION  Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings  may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to  absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods  may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any  conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended  Operating Conditions section is not implied.    ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION  This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are  not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all  integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions.  Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures  can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle  performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision  integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage  because even small parametric changes could cause the  device not to meet the published specifications.

Besides, it ensures an accurate hysteresis on the  threshold, which makes it very suitable for systems that  need small tolerance. And two options are provided to  set the watchdog timing: a standard version and an  extended one.    nRESET  The nRESET is an open-drain output pin, and users  should connect the nRESET pin to VCC or another  voltage rail through a pull-up resistor of 1kΩ to 100kΩ.  Once VCC falls below the under-voltage threshold (VITN),  the nRESET is asserted to be low. And if VCC exceeds  VITN + VHYS, the nRESET will keep low for a specified  reset delay time (tRST). And then, the nRESET pin goes  high with the pull-up resistor. Users should carefully  consider the factors such as capacitive loading, logic  low output voltage (VOL), leakage current (ID) and the  current through the nRESET pin (InRESET) to select  appropriate resistance values. It ensures that the high  and low output voltage values meet the requirements of  subsequent applications.    Manual Reset (nMR)  The manual reset input (nMR) is logic low effective, and  it can be used to initiate a reset by a processor or some  other logic circuits. The nRESET is deasserted after  tRST if nMR becomes high and VCC is above VITN + VHYS.  Knowing that the nMR pin is pulled up internally,  connect nMR to VCC or just leave it floating once it is  unnecessary to control it externally.    Under-Voltage Detection  The SGM820xQ provide three under-voltage threshold  voltage options of 1.674V, 2.325V and 3.069V (TYP),  which are suitable for 1.8V, 2.5V and 3.3V system rail  voltage monitoring. As is shown in Figure 5, when VCC  is below VITN, the nRESET is asserted and remains low.  And when VCC is higher than VITN + VHYS, the nRESET  deasserts after tRST.  The hysteresis of the built-in comparator can immune  some noise of the system. However, it is strongly  recommended to place a bypass capacitor of 0.1µF to  100nF near the VCC pin to immune the transient voltage  and ensure stable operation.  VCC VITN + VHYS VITN (Under-Voltage Limit) nRESET tRST tRST_DEL tRST_DEL   Figure 5. Under-Voltage Detection    Watchdog Mode  Details about the principles of the watchdog mode are  provided in this part.    CWD  Through  the  CWD  pin,  users  can  obtain  a  high-precision and preset watchdog timing in factory or  a programmed one. There are three options of the  SGM820xQ to configure the watchdog timer. Keep  CWD pin floating or pull up a 10kΩ resistor to VCC to set  two different factory-programmed timers. Connect a  capacitor between the CWD pin and GND to achieve  an adjustable timer. Every time when VCC exceeds the  VITN + VHYS, the device checks the CWD configuration  state within tINIT (about 390μs, TYP). During this time,  an internal state machine is used to check the CWD pin  state and lock it out until nRESET is asserted or  powered off.    Watchdog Input (WDI)  The WDI pin is the falling-edge triggered watchdog  timer input pin. The WDI pulse should be sent out  within tWD_MIN, and the pulse of WDI should be at least  larger than 50ns to ensure that the pulse can be  detected by the device. If a valid WDI is received, the  nWDO remains deasserted. If not, the nWDO is  asserted to be low.  The WDI is a logic input pin and it cannot be left floating.  Users should drive WDI to either VCC or GND to avoid  the increasing current of the supply current. When  nRESET is asserted, the watchdog function is disabled  and any signals cannot be recognized by the device.  When nRESET is deasserted, the device operates  normally and the WDI signals can be recognized.  Figure 6 shows that a valid WDI pulse can prevent  nWDO from being triggered low.

Watchdog Timing Diagram    Watchdog Output (nWDO)  The nWDO is the independent watchdog output pin,  and it can issue a fault flag in the watchdog timing with  no need to trigger an nRESET signal, which is always  used to reset the whole system. When nRESET is  deasserted, the nWDO keeps normal operation and it  asserts to be low for tRST if no valid WDI is triggered  within the valid watchdog timing region. And when the  nRESET signal is asserted by some other reasons, the  nWDO pin goes high if a resistor is connected to VCC or  another rail. When the nRESET signal is deasserted  again, the watchdog timer returns back to normal  operation.    SET  The watchdog timer can be enabled or disabled by the  SET pin. When the SET pin is connected to GND, the  watchdog timer is disabled and signals in WDI are not  recognized. Once the watchdog timer is disabled,  connect WDI to VCC or GND to prevent any increase of  ICC. When the SET pin is set to logic high, and if  nRESET is not asserted, the watchdog operates  properly. The SET pin is permitted to continuously  change the value. However, as shown in Figure 7, there  is a 140μs (TYP) time for the set-up of watchdog if the  watchdog runs from disabled to enabled. During this  period, no response can be detected on WDI by the  watchdog.    VCC Enabled SET Watchdog Enable/Disable nRESET Disabled Enabled 140μs   Figure 7. Enable/Disable the Watchdog    Device Functional Modes  The functional modes of the SGM820xQ are shown in  Table 1.  Table 1.

Only valid before VCC exceeds VITN + VHYS.  2. Only valid after VCC exceeds VITN + VHYS.  3. tPULSE is the time between two falling edges on WDI.    VCC is below VPOR (VCC < VPOR)  When VCC is below VPOR, the nRESET is not defined,  which can be either logic high or logic low. At this time,  the state of nRESET is greatly determined by the load  floating across the nRESET pin.    Between Power-On-Reset and VCC_MIN  (VPOR ≤ VCC < VCC_MIN)  When VPOR ≤ VCC < VCC_MIN, the nRESET signal is  asserted to logic low and the nWDO will turn into a  high-impedance state regardless of the WDI signal.    Normal Operation (VCC ≥ VCC_MIN)  When VCC is above or equal to VCC_MIN, the nRESET  signal is determined by VCC. When the nRESET is  asserted, the nWDO turns to a high-impedance state  and then the nWDO is pulled high through the pull-up  resistor.

CWD Functionality  Figure 8 shows the schematic circuits of three options  of the SGM820xQ to configure the watchdog timer. If  connecting a 10kΩ pull-up resistor between CWD and  VCC or leave CWD floating (high-impedance), the  factory-set watchdog timeouts are enabled, which can  be seen from Table 2.

CWD Charging Circuit  Factory-Set Timing Options  As listed in Table 2, if the factory-set timing options are  used, the CWD pin must be left floating or pull a 10kΩ  resistor to VCC.  Table 2.

The watchdog timeout of  SGM820xQ can be calculated as Equations 1 and 2,  where CCWD is in nF and tWD is in ms.  For standard versions:  tWD_standard (ms) = 3.33 × CCWD (nF) + 0.28 (ms)    (1)  For extended versions:  tWD_extended (ms) = 78.3 × CCWD (nF) + 51 (ms)      (2)  The capacitors CCWD used for design and test of the  SGM820xQ should be between 100pF and 1μF. And  Equations 1 and 2 are only accurate for ideal capacitors.  Once the capacitor tolerances are considered, the  obtained watchdog timeout may vary from the preset  value. It is recommended using ceramic capacitors with  C0G dielectric material to achieve higher accuracy.  When a CCWD capacitor is used, use Equation 1 to set  tWD for standard timing and use Equation 2 to set tWD for  extended timing.       High-Accuracy Supervisory Circuit  SGM820xQ  with Integrated Watchdog Timer      16  DECEMBER 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued)  Overdrive Voltage  Enabling the nRESET depends on the following two  factors. One factor is that the VCC amplitude is above  the trip point (ΔV1 and ΔV2), and the other factor is that  the time length that the voltage is above the trip point (t1  and t2).  When VCC is lower than the trip point for a long time,  then the nRESET is asserted and the output is pulled  low. When VCC is just a few nanosecond lower than the  trip point, the nRESET does not assert and the output  continues to be high. Alter the time length that asserts  the nRESET by increasing the proportion where VCC is  lower than the trip point. For example, when VCC is 10%  lower than the trip point, the comparator responds  much faster and the nRESET is asserted much quicker  than when just below the trip point voltage. Calculation  of the percentage overdrive is shown in Equation 3.  Overdrive = |(VCC/VITX - 1) × 100%|        (3)  Where VITX is the trip point voltage of the threshold. If  VCC is higher than the positive threshold, use VITN +  VHYS as VITX. If VCC is lower than the under-voltage  threshold, then VITN is considered. In Figure 9, t1 and t2  represent the period of time that VCC is above or below  the threshold, separately. And the propagation delay  versus overdrive for VITN and VITN + VHYS is illustrated  as well.  Due to the overdrive voltage curve, the SGM820xQ is  less sensitive to short positive or negative variations on  VCC.  t1 VITN VITN + VHYS Time t2 ΔV1 ΔV2 VCC Input Voltage   Figure 9. Overdrive Voltage    Power Supply Recommendations  The devices operate with a wide input range from 1.6V  to 6.5V. A 0.1μF ceramic capacitor is recommended  between the VCC and GND pin to reduce the input  supply noise.                                "}'
