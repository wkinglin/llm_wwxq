The  capacitor with effective capacitance in the range of 0.1μF to 12μF is recommended. It  should be placed close to this pin for decoupling.  3  TSEN  IO  Temperature Sensing and Enable Input. The external connection to this pin is checked,  once power input voltage is in the effective range by feeding current (38.6μA) out of the  pin. If the pin voltage is less than VENL (102mV), it is considered as being grounded. The  charging function is disabled while the feeding current is reduced to about 25.5μA. If the  pin voltage is higher than VENH (2.68V), charging function is enabled. If the pin voltage is  between VENL and VENH, it is considered that the NTC thermistor is connected, and the  ground resistance is evaluated for temperature safe charging. In this case, charging is  allowed, only when the pin voltage is within the range of hot threshold resistance related  voltage VHOT to cold threshold related voltage VCOLD.  The feeding current biases the pin voltage to be higher than VCOLD but less than VENH. If  pin voltage in this range is found, it is considered to be excessive cold condition or NTC  connection open, charge function is disabled.  4  GND  G  Ground of the Circuit.  8  BAT  O  Output to the Battery and/or System Load for Charging and/or Powering the System Load.

It  features with input clamp, output clamp, die temperature  regulation, NTC temperature-oriented protection and floating  charging protection. As shown in Figure 1, there are only few  external components desired. Figure 2 and Figure 3 show the  illustrative charge profiles.    System Start-Up Pre-Charge  When the input is applied and the BAT pin voltage is less than  both the pre-charge threshold voltage and activation  threshold voltage, the device outputs the constant normal  charge current for tACT, which supplies for the system load to  start up in no battery situation or the battery in protection off,  before it turns into pre-charge where the output current may  not be enough to start up the system.    Wide Charge Available Input Range  Charging is kept when the input voltage is higher than the  nominal input range, or when the supply cannot keep voltage  and current stable. The charge current is regulated to prevent  over-heating when the input voltage is at the higher range  end, and it keeps conduction and maintains minimum forward  drop-out when the input voltage is at the lower range end. It  can charge from pulse train input such as half-sine wave of  rectified AC and slow change source like solar cell  photo-voltage, while it keeps charge state flags until the  internal bias losses or the input stays low for long enough.    Voltage Fold-Back Power Retaining  When the end-of-charge condition is certified, it lowers the  output to the safe voltage VFCHG, while keeping the current  limit at the level of normal charge and retaining power to the  load system. The design avoids frequent discharging and  recharging cycling in the situation that charge supply is  always attached.    Minimum Floating Charge Time  When the charging current with high system load that sinks  more than the residual end-of-charge current and the battery  voltage stays higher than the floating charge voltage for over  tFLT duration, the battery will stop charging and enter the  end-of-charge fold-back power retaining state. As a weak  source, it may also cause the current to fall to less than the  residual end-of-charge current, and minimum floating charge  time > tFLT/2 is a part of condition for full-of-charge  certification.    Over-Temperature Charge Regulation  The device senses the die temperature. The thermal  fold-back function starts to reduce the charge current when  the internal temperature reaches the typical value of +145℃.    BAT Over-Voltage Protection  When any leakage or transient pulls VBAT higher than 104% ×  VCHG in charge, the BAT sinks current with 1.5mA clamp  current for protection.    Full-of-Charge and Input Clamp  When the full-of-charge is certified, the input IIN drops low and  the output voltage steps down from VCHG to VFCHG. The  sudden current changes the signals to the source side for  turning into the full-of-charge state, and the source side can  read the state by checking the output voltage or current. In  case of wireless or contactless charging with high open load  voltage, the device clamps its input voltage to about 21V with  26mA sinking.    NTC Temperature Sensing and Enable  The TSEN sources current (38.6μA) is used to read ground  resistance for temperature-oriented protection. A grounded  NTC thermistor is connected to the TSEN pin for temperature  sensing. Charging is allowed only when the temperature is in  suitable range. When a β3380 R25 10kΩ NTC is used, the  precise upper and lower thresholds are 45℃ and 0.5℃,  respectively.  Pull the TSEN to ground to disable charge function, and pull  the TSEN to high voltage > 2.68V to dismiss the  temperature-oriented protection function, while enables  charge.    Pre-Charge Safety Time  To avoid further damage to bad battery or wrong system load,  if the BAT pin voltage cannot reach 65% × VCHG for over tSAFE  (94 minutes), the charging will be stopped. However, for the  50Hz rectified input voltage waveform, when the input voltage  is lower than VUVLOf, the SGM41566 has no such protection  function.  This protection function is not available for the 'No  pre-charge' option.         SGM41566  Linear Regulation Battery Charger      18  NOVEMBER 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  "}'
