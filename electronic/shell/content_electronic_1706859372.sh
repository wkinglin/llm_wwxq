This current mode control  device is optimized for high density applications with  minimal  number  of  external  components.  High  switching frequency, up to 2MHz, can be chosen to  reduce the solution size by smaller inductor and  capacitors. This device can be used as a standalone or  tracking power supply. The SS/TR pin can be used to  control the output voltage startup ramp or as an input  for tracking.  Power supply sequencing for two or more power  supplies is possible by using the enable input (EN) and  the open-drain power good output (PG) signals.  The high-side (HS) MOSFET current is cycle-by-cycle  limited for overload protection. The low-side (LS)  MOSFET sourcing current is also limited to prevent  current runaway. The low-side switch also has a  sinking current limit will turn the switch off if an  excessive reverse current flows through it.  Thermal shutdown protection is activated to prevent  damage to the device when the junction temperature is  above the shutdown threshold.  The SGM61060 is available in a Green TQFN-3×3-16CL  package.    "}'

The output voltage can be set as low as  0.6V, which is equal to the device internal reference  voltage (VREF).  As a constant frequency, peak current mode control  device, SGM61060 can provide fast transient response  with a simple compensation circuit. The fixed switching  frequency is adjustable from 200kHz to 2000kHz to  allow optimization of the efficiency and size of the  converter.  For  adjusting  the  internal  switching  frequency, an external resistor RRT is connected  between the RT/CLK pin and GND. The device also  accepts an external clock source on this pin to  synchronize the oscillator using the internal phase  locked loop (PLL).   This device has a safe and monotonic startup in output  pre-biased conditions. The VIN must exceed the  under-voltage lockout threshold (VUVLO, 2.4V TYP) for  device power-up. The UVLO thresholds can be  adjusted (increased) by connecting the EN pin to the  tap point of a resistor divider between the VIN pin and  GND. The EN internal pull-up current source and the  resistor divider determine the UVLO thresholds. When  the EN is floated or is pulled high, the device is enabled  and the total device current (no switching) is near  880μA. Pulling the EN pin low will shut down the device  with 2μA (TYP) supply current.  The integrated MOSFETs are optimized for higher  efficiency at lower duty cycles. They can efficiently  provide up to 6A continuous output current.  The integrated bootstrap circuit along with the external  boot capacitor provides the bias voltage for the  high-side MOSFET driver. The voltage of the bootstrap  capacitor that is placed between the BOOT and SW  pins is continuously monitored for bootstrap UVLO  (BOOT-SW UVLO) detection. If the boot capacitor  voltage drops below the bootstrap UVLO, the SW pin  will be pulled low to recharge the boot capacitor. 100%  duty cycle operation is possible as long as the boot  capacitor voltage is higher than the 2.2V (TYP)  threshold (preset UVLO level).  The device contains a power good (PG) pin which  indicates the status of the output voltage by comparing  the FB voltage and the internal reference voltage. PG  pin is connected to the drain of internal MOSFET. The  PG signal is high when VOUT is between 94% and 104%  of its nominal (set) value and goes low if VOUT drops  below 91% or rises above 106% of its nominal value.  The SS/TR (soft-start/tracking) pin can be used to  minimize the inrush currents (soft-start function) with a  small value capacitor, or for power supply sequencing  during power-up with a resistor divider from preceding  voltage rail. It is the input pin for the voltage that is  followed by the output when the power supply is used  in the tracking mode.  The SGM61060 is protected from output over-voltage,  over-current and over-heating damage. The output  over-voltage transients are effectively minimized by the  over-voltage comparator of the power good circuit.  When an over-voltage occurs, the high-side switch is  forced off and allowed to turn on again if the VOUT drops  below 104% of its nominal value.  High-side MOSFET is naturally protected from sourcing  over-current by peak current mode control. The  low-side MOSFET is also protected bi-directionally  against over-current. This feature helps the control of  the inductor current to avoid current runaway.  If the die temperature is too high (TJ > TSD), the device  will stop switching and go to shutdown state. It will  automatically recover with a soft-start when the junction  temperature drops 15℃ (TYP) below the shutdown  temperature.  Note that a continued overload condition may cause a  cycling thermal shutdown and recovery. It will depend  on the temperature and the ventilation conditions of the  system.       2.9V to 6V Input, 6A Output,  SGM61060  Synchronous Buck Converter      14  JANUARY 2024  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued)  Power Input Pins  VIN pins can be tied together or separated depending  on the application and minimum input voltage. The VIN  pin supplies the internal circuits of the device and  needs to be above 2.9V. A voltage divider connected to  the EN pin from either VIN can be used to adjust the  power supply UVLO.     EN Pin and UVLO Programming  The EN pin is used to turn the device on and off. The  device starts operation when the EN pin voltage rises  above the enable rising threshold. Pulling the EN  voltage below the enable falling threshold, stops  switching and reduces the device current to the very  low quiescent shutdown level. Floating the EN pin  enables the device due to its internal pull-up current  source. This current source is used for programming  the UVLO threshold. An open-drain or open-collector  output connected to the EN pin can be used to control  the device. An internal UVLO circuit is implemented on  the VIN pin to disable the device and prevent  malfunction when the supply voltage is too low. The  internal VUVLO hysteresis is 105mV. To program a  higher UVLO threshold for the VIN that is typically  needed for split-rail applications, the EN pin can be  configured to Figure 3. Without external components,  the internal pull-up current (IP) sets the EN pin default  state to enable. When the device is enabled, the  second current source (IH) is activated. IP and IH are  used to set the UVLO.  The divider resistors can be calculated from Equations  1 and 2 based on the desired UVLO start and stop  thresholds. A 300mV or higher hysteresis (VSTART - VSTOP)  is recommended for the UVLO programming.  R11 R12 VIN EN IP IH   Figure 3. VIN UVLO Setting with a Resistor Divider    R11 =  VSTART ൬VEN_F VEN_R  ൰ - VSTOP IP ൬1 - VEN_F VEN_R൰ + IH                (1)    R12 =  R11 × VEN_F VSTOP - VEN_F + R11(IP + IH)           (2)    where:  • IH = 3.05μA.  • IP = 0.75μA.  • VEN_R = 1.28V.  • VEN_F = 1.16V.    Soft-Start (SS/TR)  The lower voltage between the internal VREF and the  SS/TR pin is used as the reference to regulate the  output. The soft-start capacitor is connected to the  SS/TR pin and is charged by a 48μA (VSS/TR < 0.15V)  or 2.2μA (VSS/TR > 0.15V) internal current source to set  the soft-start time (tSS).  Equation 3 can be used to calculate the soft-start time  (10% to 90% rise) for a selected soft-start capacitor  (CSS).  S SS S t C (nF)  (m 3 s) =                    (3)    Startup with Pre-biased Output  The low-side switch is prohibited from turning on and  discharging the output if a pre-biased voltage is sensed  on the output before startup. As long as the SS/TR pin  voltage is below VFB, the low-side switch is not allowed  to sink current to have a monotonic startup with  pre-bias output.    Reference Voltage (VREF)  A precise 0.6V reference is internally implemented by  scaling the output of a temperature-stable bandgap  circuit. The actual reference voltage for output setting is  changed during startup or tracking.       2.9V to 6V Input, 6A Output,  SGM61060  Synchronous Buck Converter      15  JANUARY 2024  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued)  Output Voltage Setting  The output voltage of the device can be adjusted by  resistors R1 and R2 which are connected to the FB pin  (see Figure 1) to set the output voltage. Use resistors  with 1% tolerance or better for good output accuracy.  Equation 4 can be used to calculate the R1 and R2  (upper and lower resistors) values based on the  desired output voltage (VOUT) and VREF.  R1 = VOUT - VREF VREF  × R2                          (4)  where: VREF = 0.6V.  For example, a 20kΩ resistor can be chosen for R2 and  then R1 is calculated. Do not choose too large resistors  to cause output errors due to the FB bias current or  make the regulator susceptible to the noises coupled to  the FB input.  The minimum and maximum adjustable output voltages  are limited by the minimum on-time of the high-side  switch and the required bootstrap voltage respectively.  More details are provided in the Bootstrap Voltage  (BOOT) and Operation with Low Dropout (100% Duty  Cycle) section.    Power Good (PG)  The PG is an open-drain output. It is released if there is  no fault and the FB pin voltage is in regulation. The PG  is pulled low if the FB voltage is lower than 91% or  above 106% of the reference voltage. When the device  is disabled by EN pin or the voltage of SS/TR pin is  under 1.33V, or if a fault such as UVLO or thermal  shutdown occurs, PG is also pulled low.  A 10kΩ to 100kΩ pull-up resistor connected to a  voltage rail less than 5.5V is recommended for PG. An  option is to use the output voltage for PG pull-up. The  state of PG is valid only if the VIN > 1.2V. The current  sinking capability of PG is limited until VIN exceeds the  2.9V at which the full sinking capacity is available.    Startup Sequencing (SS/TR)  The SS/TR, EN and PG pins allow the implementation  of common power supply sequencing methods. A  simple sequencing approach is shown in Figure 4 in  which the right side SGM61060 device is powered up  after the left one. The PG of the first device is coupled  to the EN pin of the second. The second power supply  is enabled after the primary supply reaches regulation.   EN SS/TR PG EN SS/TR PG   Figure 4. Sequential Startup Sequence    Frequency and Synchronization (RT/CLK)  The device can operate in two modes to adjust  switching frequency.  In the RT mode, a resistor (RRT) is placed between the  RT/CLK and GND pins to set the free running switching  frequency of the PLL.   In the CLK mode, an external clock drives the RT/CLK  pin and the internal switching clock oscillator is  synchronized to CLK by the PLL. The CLK mode  overrides the RT mode. The device automatically  detects the input clock and switches to the CLK mode.    Switching Frequency Setting (RT Mode)  Selection of the switching frequency is generally a  tradeoff among the solution size, efficiency, and the  minimum controllable on-time. The RRT resistance can  be designed from Equation 13.   RT 1.084 SW  ( (kH 72432 R kΩ) f z) 25 = +              (5)    Synchronization (CLK Mode)  The device uses an internal phase locked loop (PLL) to  set or synchronize to an external clock signal with the  200kHz to 2000kHz range. Mode change which is from  RT mode to CLK mode is allowed.  For stable synchronization, a square wave clock with  20% to 80% duty cycle must be applied to the RT/CLK  pin. The logic low and high levels of the clock must be  below 0.4V and above 2.2V respectively. The switching  cycle starts with the falling edge of the RT/CLK signal.  If both RT and CLK modes are needed in an application,  configuration shown in Figure 5 can be used. The RT  mode can be overridden by CLK mode when both RRT  and clock are present.       2.9V to 6V Input, 6A Output,  SGM61060  Synchronous Buck Converter      16  JANUARY 2024  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued)  Mode switch occurs when the RT/CLK is pulled above  2.0V for the first time. Once CLK mode is selected, the  PLL is locked to external CLK and the RT/CLK pin  shifts to a high-impedance state. Going back from CLK  mode to RT mode is not recommended.  RRT RT/CLK RT/CLK Mode Select   Figure 5. Using RT and CLK Modes Together    Constant Frequency PWM  The SGM61060 operates at fixed frequency that can be  set by an external resistor or synchronized by external  clock.  It is based on peak current control mode architecture.  The high-side MOSFET is turned on until the sensing  current ramp signal reaches the COMP voltage  determined by the EA. If the switch current does not  reach the reference value that generates from the  COMP voltage at the end of a cycle, the high-side  switch remains on for the next cycle until the current  meets the reference value. A slope compensation block  slightly reduces the sensed high-side switch current  before comparison (depending on the on-time) to avoid  sub-harmonic oscillations.    Continuous Current Mode Operation (CCM)  In most load conditions, the device operates in  continuous conduction mode (CCM) (forced PWM). For  light loads, the inductor current can be negative when  the low-side switch is on. However, if the current  reaches the low-side sinking current limit, the low-side  switch will be forced off.    Error Amplifier  The output voltage is sensed by a resistor divider  through the FB pin and is compared with the internal  reference. The error amplifier generates an output  current that is proportional to the voltage difference  (error), and the transconductance is 265μA/V. The  generated current is then fed into the external  compensation network to generate the voltage on the  COMP pin, which sets the reference value for the peak  current that controls the on-time of the power MOSFET.  COMP is pulled down to the ground when the device  shuts down.    Slope Compensation  To avoid sub-harmonic oscillations that result in  unstable  PWM  pulses,  a  small  negative-slope  compensating ramp is added to the measured switch  current before it is used to generate the PWM signal.  The slope compensation has no influence on the peak  current limit which is maintained over full range of duty  cycle.    Output Over-Voltage Protection (OVP)  The device contains an over-voltage protection circuit  to avoid high overshoots of the output voltage during  operation. Usually an OVP occurs after removal of an  overload condition. When the output voltage is dropped  due to a persisting overload, the error amplifier output  reaches to its maximum and forces the converter to  provide the maximum output current. Upon removal of  the overload condition, the regulator output rises  quickly because the high inductor current charges the  output capacitor rapidly, especially if COUT is small. The  error amplifier will respond and re-adjust itself but not  as fast as the output filter (LC) and an overshoot  occurs.  To minimize the overshoots, the device monitors the FB  pin voltage and compares it to the internal OVP  threshold. If the threshold is exceeded, the high-side  MOSFET is turned off to stop feeding current to the  output. When the FB voltage drops below the OVP  threshold, the high-side MOSFET can turn on again in  the next cycle.       2.9V to 6V Input, 6A Output,  SGM61060  Synchronous Buck Converter      17  JANUARY 2024  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued)  Device Functional Modes  Bootstrap Voltage (BOOT) and Operation with Low  Dropout (100% Duty Cycle)  An integrated bootstrap regulator is used for powering  the high-side MOSFET gate driver. A small 0.1μF  ceramic capacitor (X5R or X7R grade) with at least 10V  rating is required between the BOOT and SW pins to  supply the gate driver. It is recharged from VIN source  through an internal switch every time the SW goes low.  Recharge happens when the BOOT pin voltage is less  than VIN and the BOOT-SW voltage is below the  required regulation for the high-side gate voltage.  The SGM61060 has no minimum off-time. It can  operate at 100% duty cycle as long as the BOOT-SW  voltage is higher than its UVLO threshold (2.2V TYP). If  the BOOT-SW voltage drops below its UVLO threshold,  the high-side switch turns off and the low-side switch  turns on to recharge the boot capacitor. If the  BOOT-SW voltage drops below its UVLO threshold, the  high-side switch turns off and the low-side turns on to  recharge the boot capacitor.    Over-Current Protection  Both high-side (HS) and low-side (LS) switches are  protected from over-current with cycle-by-cycle current  limiting as will be explained in the next two sections.     High-side Switch Over-Current Protection  Using current mode control, the pulse width (from the  beginning of the cycle until HS turn-off) is determined  by the compensator output voltage (VCOMP at COMP pin)  in a cycle-by-cycle basis. In each cycle the high-side  switch current is continuously compared with the  current set point determined by compensator output  (VCOMP) and when the high-side current reaches to that  reference (peak current), the high-side switch is turned  off.    Low-side MOSFET Over-Current Protection  The current of the low-side switch is continuously  monitored while it is turned on. Normally, the low-side  switch sources current from ground to the load through  the inductor. Before the beginning of a new cycle, the  low-side current is compared to its current limit which is  normally lower than the high-side current limit. Only  when the low-side source current drops below its  current limit, the high-side MOSFET will turn on again  for the new cycle.  In some operating conditions, the low-side switch sinks  current from the load to the ground. The low-side  sinking current has a typical limit of 4.5A. If this limit is  exceeded, the low-side switch will immediately turn off  and both switches will not turn on until the end of the  cycle.    Thermal Shutdown  To protect the device from damage due to overheating,  a thermal shutdown feature is implemented to disable  the device when the die temperature exceeds +170℃  (TYP).  A new power-up sequence is  initiated  automatically once the temperature falls below +155℃  (15℃ hysteresis, TYP).    Feedback Loop Small Signal Model  The equivalent small signal model of the control loop  for frequency response and transient analysis is given  in Figure 6.  The compensation network (R3, C1 and C2) is placed in  the output of the transconductance error amplifier (EA).  The EA can be simplified as an ideal voltage controlled  current source with 265μA/V gain. The ROEA model the  output resistance of the EA. Power converter is  modeled with a pure 19A/V gain. The inductor  dynamics are effectively removed in the cycle-by-cycle  average small signal model, because with the current  mode control the inductor average current is set by the  compensator. The COUT and RESR model the output  capacitance and its parasitic ESR.  To measure the frequency response, the loop is broken  at points ‘a’ and ‘b’ to insert a small signal (e.g. 1mV)  AC source. For small signal frequency response  analysis, the magnitude and phase versus frequency  for the output to input transfer functions of each stage is  plotted.  The  ‘a/c’  (power  stage  gain),  ‘c/b’  (compensation gain) and ‘a/b’ (loop gain) voltage ratios  are commonly used for the analysis.       2.9V to 6V Input, 6A Output,  SGM61060  Synchronous Buck Converter      18  JANUARY 2024  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued)  To simulate or test the response of the output to load  steps in time domain (dynamic loop response), the load  (RL) is replaced with a stepping current source with  proper amplitude, repetition rate and rate of change  (A/µs) depending on the application. As a common  example, stepping between 25% and 75% of the  nominal load with ±1A/µs slew rate and repeating at  1kHz or 10kHz can be used for testing and comparison  of the power supply transient response to rapid load  changes.

Small Signal Model for Loop Response    Simplified Model for Peak Current Mode  A simplified small signal model to design the frequency  compensation network is given in Figure 7. The power  stage and duty cycle modulator are approximated by a  voltage-controlled current source (VCCS) that is  controlled by the error amplifier output (VCOMP) and  provides current to the output capacitor and the load.  The control-to-output transfer function (VOUT/VCOMP)  consists of a DC voltage gain (ADC), a dominant pole (fP)  determined by RL × COUT time constant, and a simple  ESR-zero (fZ) determined by RESR × COUT time constant  as given in Equations 5, 6, 7 and 8. The VCCS  transconductance is the ratio of the output current  change to the control voltage (COMP) change. This is  equivalent to the power stage transconductance (gmPS)  that is 19A/V for this device. As indicated in Equation 6,  for resistive loads, the DC voltage gain (ADC) is equal to  the power stage transconductance (gmPS) multiplied by  the load resistance (RL). Therefore, the DC gain drops  with the reduced load resistance. This relationship can  be problematic because it could move the crossover  frequency of the converter in the same way.

Fortunately, the dominant pole also moves with load  current as given in Equation 7. As highlighted in Figure  5, the crossover frequency (0dB gain location) is not  affected by the combined effect. As the load current  decreases, the gain increases and the pole frequency  decreases. Having a fixed crossover frequency  simplifies the design of the frequency compensation for  a changing load.       2.9V to 6V Input, 6A Output,  SGM61060  Synchronous Buck Converter      19  JANUARY 2024  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued)  Small Signal Model for Frequency  Compensation  The SGM61060 can easily use the common Type 2 and  3 compensation circuits, as shown in Figure 6.  Compared to Type 2B, the Type 2A compensation has  an extra high-frequency pole (by C2) to attenuate  high-frequency noise and ensure that gain remains  very low at high frequencies against the ESR-zero  effect that tends to increase the gain at higher  frequencies. In the Type 3 compensation, the additional  C10 capacitor is added in parallel to the upper feedback  resistor divider for phase boost at the crossover  frequency. An extra resistor may be used in series with  C10 for more control on the phase boost. The following  guidelines are provided for designers who prefer to  compensate by the standard loop design method.  These  equations  are  only  available  for  those  applications where the ESR-zero is higher than the  control loop bandwidth (crossover frequency). This  condition is usually valid when ceramic output  capacitors are used. For low frequency ESR-zeros  (capacitors with high ESR), see the Application  Information  section  for  a  step-by-step  design  procedure.

The first step is to determine the crossover frequency,  which is normally set to 1/10th of the switching  frequency.  COUT is also initially chosen based on the switching  frequency and ripple requirement.  2. R3 can be determined by:     R3 = 2π × fC × VOUT × COUT gmEA × VREF × gmPS                       (10)  where:  • gmEA is the gm amplifier gain (265μA/V).  • gmPS is the power stage gain (19A/V).  • VREF is the reference voltage (0.6V).  3. A compensating zero should be placed at the  dominated pole of the device, which is at fP =  1  COUT ×   RL × 2π. C1 can be determined by:   C1 = RL × COUT  R3                                     (11)  4. C2 is optional and adds a high frequency pole to  cancel the zero created by the output capacitor ESR.   C2 = RESR × COUT  R3                                    (12)  5. C10 can be added for Type 3 compensation that  allows a slightly higher bandwidth and better phase  margin.

NOTE: C15 is optional. If the input voltage is more than 200mm far from the VIN of SGM61060, or the input voltage is on/off by  air-break switch, C15 should be installed. Otherwise, the spike voltage over 7V at the input side is caused, which will damage  SGM61060.  Figure 9. SGM61060 Typical Application Circuit    Design Requirements  In this example, a high frequency regulator with  ceramic output capacitors will be designed using  SGM61060 and the details will be reviewed. The  design requirements are typically determined at the  system level. In this example, the known parameters  are summarized in Table 1.  Table 1.

Higher switching frequencies allow  smaller solution size, smaller filter inductors and  capacitors. The bandwidth of the converter can be  increased for faster response. It is also easier to filter  noises because they also shift to higher frequencies.  The drawbacks are increased switching and gate  driving losses that result in lower efficiency and tighter  thermal limits. Also the duty cycle range and Buck ratio  will be limited due to the minimum on-time and/or  off-time limits of the converter. In this design, fSW =  500kHz is chosen as a tradeoff. From Equation 13, the  nearest standard resistor for this frequency is R4 =  82.5kΩ.

Generally, a  smaller inductor is preferred to allow larger bandwidth  and smaller size. The ratio of inductor current ripple (∆IL)  to the maximum output current (IOUT) is represented as  KIND factor (∆IL/IOUT). The inductor ripple current is  bypassed and filtered by the output capacitor and the  inductor DC current is passed to the output. Inductor  ripple is selected based on a few considerations. The  peak inductor current (IOUT + ∆IL/2) must have a safe  margin from the saturation current of the inductor in the  worst-case conditions, especially if a hard-saturation  core type inductor (such as ferrite) is chosen. During  power-up with large output capacitor, over-current,  output shorted or load transient conditions, the actual  peak current of inductor can be greater than IL_PEAK  calculated in Equation 17. For peak current mode  converter, selecting an inductor with saturation current  above the switch current limit is sufficient. The ripple  current also affects the selection of the output capacitor.  COUT RMS current rating must be higher than the  inductor RMS ripple. Typically, a 10% to 30% ripple is  selected (KIND = 0.1 ~ 0.3). Choosing a higher KIND  value reduces the selected inductance.  × × × INMAX OUT OUT 1 OUT IND INMAX SW    = V - V V L I K V f      (14)  In this example, KIND = 0.3 is chosen and the  inductance is calculated to be 1.067μH. The nearest  standard value is 1μH. The ripple, RMS and peak  inductors current calculations are summarized in  Equations 19, 20 and 21 respectively.

Output Capacitor Design  Three primary criteria must be considered for design of  the output capacitor (COUT): (1) the converter pole  location, (2) the output voltage ripple, (3) the transient  response to a large change in load current. The  selected value must satisfy all of them. The desired  transient response is usually expressed as maximum  overshoot,  maximum  undershoot,  or  maximum  recovery time of VOUT in response to a large load step.  Transient response is usually the more stringent criteria  in low output voltage applications. The output capacitor  must provide the increased load current or absorb the  excess inductor current (when the load current steps  down) until the control loop can re-adjust the current of  the inductor to the new load level. Typically, it requires  two or more cycles for the loop to detect the output  change and respond (change the duty cycle). Another  requirement may also be expressed as desired hold-up  time in which the output capacitor must hold the output  voltage above a certain level for a specified period if the  input power is removed. It may also be expressed as  the maximum output voltage drop or rise when the full  load is connected or disconnected (100% load step).  Equation 18 can be used to calculate the minimum  output capacitance that is needed to supply energy  until the control loop responds to the load change with  a maximum allowed output transient of ΔVOUT  (overshoot or undershoot).   EL = 1/2 × L × I2 = 1/2 × 1 × 32 = 4.5μJ  EL_INITIAL = 1/2 × COUT × V2 = 1/2 × COUT × 1.22  EL_FINAL = 1/2 × COUT × (V + ΔVOUT)2          = 1/2 × COUT × (1.2 + 0.06)2  EL_FINAL = EL_INITIAL + EL            (18)   For example, if the acceptable transient to a 3A load  step is 5%, by inserting ΔVOUT = 0.05 × 1.2V = 0.06V  and ΔIOUT = 3.0A, the minimum required capacitance  will be 60.98μF. Generally, the ESR of ceramic  capacitors is small enough. The impact of output  capacitor ESR on the transient is not taken into account  in Equation 18.       2.9V to 6V Input, 6A Output,  SGM61060  Synchronous Buck Converter      22  JANUARY 2024  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued)  Equation 19 can be used for the output ripple criteria  and finding the needed minimum output capacitance.  VORIPPLE is the maximum acceptable ripple. In this  example, the allowed ripple is 30mV that results in  minimum capacitance of 16μF.  × × OUT ORIPPLE SW RIPPLE 1 1 C V 8 f I  >              (19)  where  • VRIPPLE is the maximum allowable output voltage  ripple.  • IRIPPLE is the inductor ripple current.  Note that the impact of output capacitor ESR on the  ripple is not considered in Equation 19. Use Equation  20 to calculate the maximum acceptable ESR of the  output capacitor to meet the output voltage ripple  requirement. In this example, the ESR must be less  than 30mV/1.92A = 15.6mΩ.  ORIPPLE ESR RIPPLE V R I <                  (20)  Higher nominal capacitance value must be chosen due  to aging, temperature, and DC bias derating of the  output capacitors. In this example, a 47μF/10V X5R  ceramic capacitor with 3mΩ of ESR is used. The  amount of ripple current that a capacitor can handle  without damage or overheating is limited. The inductor  ripple is bypassed through the output capacitor.  Equation 21 calculates the RMS current that the output  capacitor must support. In this example, it is 554.3mA.

At least 4.7μF of effective capacitance  (after deratings) is needed on the VIN input. The input  ripple current can be calculated from Equation 22. For  this example, the input ripple RMS current is 2.94A.  OUT INMIN OUT CIRMS OUT INMIN INMIN V (V V ) I I V V × − = × ×       (22)  For this design, a ceramic capacitor with at least 10V  voltage rating is required to support the maximum input  voltage. So, three 47μF/10V and a 0.1μF/10V  capacitors are selected for VIN to cover all DC bias,  thermal and aging deratings.  The input capacitance determines the regulator input  voltage ripple. This ripple can be calculated from  Equation 23. In this example, the input voltage ripple is  21.3mV.  OUTMAX IN IN SW I 0.25 ΔV  =  C f × ×             (23)    Soft-Start Capacitor  The soft-start capacitor programs the ramp-up time of  the output voltage during power-up. The ramp is  needed in many applications due to limited voltage  slew rate required by the load or limited available input  current to avoid input voltage sag during startup (UVLO)  or to avoid over-current protection that can occur during  output capacitor charging. Soft-start will solve all these  issues by limiting the output voltage slew rate.   Equation 24 can be used to calculate the soft-start  capacitor for a required soft-start time (tSS). In this  example, the output capacitor value is 5 × 47μF and the  soft-start time is not critical because it does not require  too much charge for 1.2V output voltage. However, it is  better to set a small arbitrary value, like CSS = 10nF that  results in 3.33ms startup time.   S SS S t C (nF)  (m 3 s) =                (24)    Bootstrap Capacitor Selection  A 0.1μF ceramic capacitor with 10V or higher voltage  rating must be connected between the BOOT-SW pins.  X5R or better dielectric types are recommended.     Feedback Resistors  Choosing a 20kΩ value for the upper resistor (R7), the  lower resistor (R8) can be calculated from Equation 25.  R2 is also calculated as 20kΩ. For higher output  accuracy, choose resistors with better tolerance (1% or  better).

Above the 0.6V minimum  possible output, the lowest achievable voltage is given  by Equation 26.  VOUTMIN = tONMIN × fSWMAX (VINMAX + IOUTMIN (RDSON_HMIN -  RDSON_LMIN)) - IOUTMIN (RL + RDSON_HMIN)   (26)  where  • VOUTMIN = Minimum achievable output voltage.  • tONMIN = Minimum controllable on-time (85ns MAX).  • fSWMAX = Maximum fSW (including tolerance).  • VINMAX = Maximum input voltage.  • IOUTMIN = Minimum load current.  • RDSON_HMIN = Minimum high-side switch RDSON (11.2mΩ  to 13mΩ TYP).  • RDSON_LMIN = Minimum low-side switch RDSON (11.2mΩ  to 13mΩ TYP).  • DCR = Inductor series resistance.  • RL = Output Inductor series resistance.    Loop Compensation Design  Several techniques are used by engineers to  compensate a DC/DC regulator. The method presented  here uses simple calculations and generally results in  high phase margins. For current mode control, Type 2  compensation is usually chosen. However, due to the  more slope compensation, which brings some phase  attenuation, Type 3 compensation is adopted.  For the SGM61060, 50kHz is selected as the crossover  frequency. From the Figure 10, the gain at 50kHz is  -9.816dB and the phase is -125.663 degrees. The error  amplifier gain set by R3 is required to compensate  power stage for +11.35dB at fC, and the value can be  calculated from Equation 27.

Also, on the top layer, there are  connections for the remaining pins of the SGM61060  and a large top-side area filled with ground.  • The top layer ground area must be connected to the  internal ground layer(s) using vias at the input bypass  capacitor, the output filter capacitor and directly under  the SGM61060 device to provide a thermal path from  the exposed thermal pad land to ground.  • The GND pin must be tied directly to the power pad  under the IC and the power pad.  • For operation at full rated load, the top-side ground  area together with the internal ground plane must  provide adequate heat dissipating area.  • There are several signals paths that conduct fast  changing currents or voltages that can interact with  stray inductance or parasitic capacitance to generate  noise or degrade the power supplies performance.  • Take care to minimize the loop area formed by the  bypass capacitor connections, the AGND pins, and the  ground connections.  • The VIN pin must also be bypassed to ground using a  low ESR ceramic capacitor with X5R or X7R dielectric.       2.9V to 6V Input, 6A Output,  SGM61060  Synchronous Buck Converter      24  JANUARY 2024  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued)  • Since the SW connection is the switching node, the  output inductor must be placed close to the SW pins,  and the area of the PCB conductor minimized to  prevent excessive capacitive coupling.  •Try to minimize this conductor length while maintaining  adequate width.  • The small signal components must be grounded to  the analog ground path as shown.  • All sensitive analog traces and components such as  FB, RT/CLK and COMP must be placed away from  high-voltage switching nodes such as SW, BOOT and  the output inductor to avoid noise coupling.  • The output voltage sense trace must be connected to  the positive terminal of one output capacitor in the  design with the best high frequency characteristics. The  output voltage will be most tightly regulated at the  voltage sense point.  • The RT/CLK pin is sensitive to noise, so the RT  resistor must be placed as close as possible to the IC  and routed with minimal lengths of trace.  • The additional external components can be placed  approximately as shown.  • It may be possible to obtain acceptable performance  with alternate PCB layouts. However, this layout has  been shown to produce good results and is meant as a  guideline.  • Land pattern and stencil information is provided in the  datasheet addendum.  • The dimension and outline information is for the  standard TQFN-3×3-16CL package.
