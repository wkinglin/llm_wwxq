Table 1. H-Bridge Control Logic with xENBL/xPHASE Inputs  xENBL  xPHASE  xOUT1  xOUT2  0  X  Z  Z  1  1  H  L  1  0  L  H    Current Regulation  With each PWM pulse, the winding current rises at a  rate determined by the winding inductance and the  H-bridge DC voltage (VM/L). When the current reaches  the chopping threshold (path S1 in Figure 3), the pulse  is terminated and current will decay until the next PWM  cycle, as will be explained in the next section.  H-bridge current is sensed by a shunt resistor  connected from the ISENx pin to GND. The sensed  voltage is multiplied by AV = 5V/V and then it is  compared with the chopping threshold as reference.  This threshold is generated by multiplying, the xVREF  input voltage to one of the four scale factors: 0 (or  disabled), 38%, 71% or 100% (full-scale). The scale is  set by the xI1 and xI0 digital inputs through a 2-bit DAC.  Therefore, the full-scale chopping current is given by:  = × REF CHOP SENSE xV xI 5 R             (1)  For example, with a 3.3V reference and RSENSE = 0.5Ω,  the full-scale current is 3.3V/(5 × 0.5Ω) = 1.32A.  Note that when both l0 and l1 inputs are high, there is  no current and the H-bridge is disabled. In the previous  example, if xI1, xI0 = 00, the full-scale chopping current  is 1.32A. For xI1, xI0 = 01 and 10, it is 0.937A and  0.502A, respectively. For xI1, xI0 = 11, the H-bridge will  be disabled (no current).      Table 2. H-Bridge Current Scaling with DAC Digital Inputs  xI1  xI0  Relative to IFS Current  (% Full-Scale Chopping Current)  1  1  0% (Bridge Disabled)  1  0  38%  0  1  71%  0  0  100% (Full-Scale)    Decay Modes  After the current reaches to the chopping threshold and  the PWM pulse is terminated, the H-bridge switch  states will change depending on the selected decay  mode (fast or slow).  In the fast decay mode, after reaching the threshold,  the state of all switches are reversed to apply negative  voltage to the winding and force the current to ramp  down to zero (path S2 in Figure 3). The H-bridge is  disabled (all switched off) just before the winding  current reaches zero to avoid current reversal. Fast  decay is selected by applying a high logic to the  DECAY input.  In the slow decay mode, after the threshold is reached,  the upper switch is turned off and both lower switches  are turned on to apply zero voltage on the winding and  reduce current (path S0 in Figure 3). The current ramp  down slope is slower in this case. Winding current will  circulate in the lower switches during slow decay. Slow  decay is selected by applying a logic low to the DECAY  input.  The SGM42613 supports a mixed decay mode as well  by leaving the DECAY input open (float). In this mode  the decay starts in fast mode for a fixed period (33% of  the tOFF time) and then changes to slow mode for the  rest of the cycle.

Decay Modes and Current Paths in the  H-Bridges    xENBL, nRESET and nSLEEP Inputs  The xENBL is an active high enable input for the bridge x.  When xENBL is pulled low, H-bridge will brake for 10ms,  then all H-bridge FETs are disabled.  The nRESET is an active low reset input for the internal  logic. All other logic inputs are ignored if nRESET is  low.  The nSLEEP is an active low input to put the device in  low-power (sleep mode) state. In sleep mode, all  internal clocks, bridges, charge pump and V3P3OUT  regulator are disabled (stopped). Also, all logic inputs  are ignored.   When nRESET or nSLEEP is pulled low, H-bridge will  brake for 10ms, then all H-bridge FETs are disabled.  After removing the sleep mode, a short recovery time  (near 1ms) is needed before the driver can go back to  full operation mode.       Protection Features  This device is protected against under-voltage,  over-current and over-temperature conditions as will be  described below.    Over-Current Protection (OCP)  All switches of the H-bridges are current limit and if an  over-current is detected on one of them, its gate drive  signal is removed. If the current limit persists for a  period longer than the OCP time, H-bridge will brake for  10ms, then all H-bridge FETs are disabled and the  nFAULT output is pulled low (shutdown). The device  will not restart automatically and will be disabled until  VM supply is removed and re-applied or reset through  nRESET pin.  Over-current may occur due to an output short to  ground, or to VM rail, or across the motor windings. The  OCP is independent of ISENx circuitry and inputs.    Thermal Shutdown (TSD)  The device will shut down if the die temperature  exceeds shutdown threshold. H-bridge will brake for  10ms, then both H-bridges will turn off and the nFAULT  output will be driven low. Device will recover  automatically when the temperature falls below the  TSD hysteresis window.    Under-Voltage Lockout (UVLO)  If the VM pin voltage falls below the under-voltage  lockout threshold, all internal circuits will be disabled  and the internal logic will be reset. Operation resumes  when VM exceeds the UVLO rising threshold.                 SGM42613  Dual H-Bridge Motor Controller IC      10  DECEMBER 2022  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  "}'

As discussed for Equation (1) with the sensing gain of  Av = 5V/V for the SGM42613, the full-scale current can  be calculated as:    FS V SENSE SENSE xVREF(V) xVREF(V) I (A) A R (Ω) 5 R (Ω) = = × ×   (2)  So, with RSENSE = 100mΩ, to get IFS = 2A, the xVREF  voltage must be set to 1V.    Decay Modes  The SGM42613 supports three different decay modes:  slow decay, fast decay, and mixed decay. The winding  currents are regulated by fixed frequency PWM. Each  PWM pulse continues until the winding current reaches  the chopping threshold (ITRIP), and then one of the three  decay modes starts and continues until the next PWM  pulse.  The blanking time (tBLANK) limits the lowest width of the  PWM drive pulse. Note that due to ignoring the ITRIP  current during the tBLANK period, a current overshoot  may occur and cause over-current protection.

For example, if the motor RMS current is 2A and with  RSENSE = 100mΩ, the resistor loss is 0.4W. For 3A, it will  increase significantly to 0.9W.  Usually, resistors rated power is given at a specific  ambient temperature such as room temperature. A  derating curve is also provided for higher ambient  temperatures, caused by other system elements. It is  advised to check the actual temperature of the resistor  and other power components in the final system and  make sure they are operating within their rated  operating range.  For lower cost and to reduce inductance and also for  better distribution of the heat, several standard  resistors can be placed in parallel between the sense  and GND pins rather than using a large shunt resistor.    Power Supply  The SGM42613 operating supply voltage (VM) is from  8.2V to 36V. Connect VMA and VMB pins together and  to the motor power supply. Place two separate 0.1μF  decoupling ceramic capacitors as close as possible to  these pins and device GND. Additional bulk capacitors  are also required and should be placed close to the  device. The bulk capacitance is selected based on the  application needs as described in the next section.

External Supply Connection    Bulk Capacitors  Consider the following factors to design the bulk  capacitor:   Power supply type (impedance, current limit, ripple,  etc.)   Maximum acceptable VM voltage ripple   Parasitic inductance of the supply wiring   Type of the motor (stepper)   Motor start-up current requirements   Motor braking method  As a rule, try to minimize the parasitic inductance of the  supply to motor connections. High inductance limits the  response time when a rapid current change is needed  and causes large voltage spikes. Similarly, if the bulk  capacitance is not large enough, sharp changes in the  motor current result in large voltage drops (or increased  voltage when motor brakes). The bulk capacitance  must be large enough to limit switching and stepping  ripples in the acceptable range for proper operation. A  final test on the design is recommended to verify or  adjust the selected bulk capacitance value.
