By  using short pulse injections into the input capacitance  and measuring the voltage change, load existence is  periodically checked.  The SGM790A and SGM790C provide wake-up output  pins, denoted by WKP and nWKP respectively. The logic  levels of the SGM790C are completely the opposite of  the SGM790A. When a load attachment or detachment  is sensed, a pulse (1.3s, TYP) is generated on WKP  (nWKP) pin to report the status change or to awaken the  host. The bidirectional WKP (nWKP) pin is also used as  a selection input pin to choose either SNS1 or SNS2  channel. The detection status of SNSx channel is  reported on the FLG output pin during the 1.3s window.  In the SGM790B, the most recent detection status of  SNSx channel is reported on the corresponding FLGx  channel output.

For example, a power  bank can detect the connection or removal of the loads  to power up or power down the power circuits. The  SGM790A, SGM790B and SGM790C provide a simple  load detection solution for these applications by  checking the load capacitance as indicator. The SNS1  and SNS2 pins act as pulse sources with relatively  large internal resistances. Short pulses of tTEST (35ns,  TYP) time are periodically injected by the SNS1 and  SNS2 pins to the power bus(es) every tDET (160ms, TYP)  period (5 ~ 7 times per second).  Each SNSx pin couples to the bus by a capacitor. With  ferrite beads used on the bus, the permanent  capacitances of the power bus are isolated and the  load capacitance can be detected directly by injecting  signals. High-impedance ferrite beads block the pulses  from injecting into the bus capacitors. The SNS1 and  SNS2 pins send the pulses periodically and check the  resulting voltage changes. When a load capacitance is  attached to a SNSx pin, the pulse voltage will drop, and  when the load is removed, the pulse voltage will rise.    SGM790A WKP and FLG Pins  The FLG output of the SGM790A reflects the status of  SNS1 and SNS2 depending on the WKP state. If the  WKP is high or pulled high, the FLG reports the status  sensed by SNS2, and if it is pulled low while it is  already high, the FLG will report SNS1 status.  The key timing diagram of the SGM790A is shown in  Figure 3. Upon detection of a change on a SNSx input  or by forcing the WKP from low to high, a one-shot that  generates a time frame with a period of tWKP_OUT (1.3s,  TYP) is triggered. During this period, the WKP can be  pulled low or high to select which channel is reported  on the FLG output.  Each rising edge of the WKP, which can be caused by  change detection or forcing high from low or releasing  from forcing low during tWKP_OUT time, triggers a new  period of tWKP_OUT.  The FLG output returns to Hi-Z state when the WKP  goes low after the tWKP_OUT period. If the WKP remains  high during the tWKP_OUT timeout, the FLG output will  keep indicating the SNS2 status. And then FLG output  changes to Hi-Z if the WKP is forced low or released  from forcing high.  When the FLG output is in Hi-Z state, pulling WKP high  will trigger an approximately 1.3s pulse in which the  latest status of the loads can be read on the FLG output.  Table 1 summarizes the FLG output in different  conditions.  The SGM790A checks the loads in every tDET period,  and WKP reports the change with the tWKP_OUT window.  Table 1. SGM790A/SGM790C FLG Output During tWKP_OUT   SNS1/SNS2  FLG  WKP = 1   (nWKP = 0),   for SNS2  WKP = 0    (nWKP = 1),   for SNS1  With Load Capacitance  High  High  Without Load Capacitance  Low  Low    SGM790C nWKP and FLG Pins  The timing logic of the SGM790C is completely the  opposite of the SGM790A. An nWKP falling edge  triggers a new period of tWKP_OUT. The FLG output  indicates SNS1 or SNS2 status when the nWKP is low  or high. Please refer to the Table 1 and Figure 4.    SGM790B FLG1 and FLG2 Pins  Right after each detection (tDET) period of the SGM790B,  the status of the loads connected to SNS1 and SNS2  are updated on the FLG1 and FLG2 outputs  respectively. The FLGx state remains unchanged until  the next test.  Table 2 summarizes how FLG1 and FLG2 are updated  depending on the load sense inputs.  Table 2.

SGM790C Timing Diagram    Components Selection  Referring to Figure 1 and Figure 5, a few external  components are needed to complete the load detection  circuit. It is important that the ferrite beads B1 and B2  should have enough current rating to carry the load  current and high enough impedance at high frequency  to isolate the test pulses from the permanent bus  capacitors. FBSWB0402-102-201R is recommended.  Coupling capacitors C1 and C2 can be chosen in a  range from 100nF to 1μF.  If the load connection point is close to the sense pins,  the SGM790A, SGM790B and SGM790C can easily  detect connection or removal of the loads with  minimum 100nF input capacitance. If the load is away  from the device, the load capacitance must be  increased to ensure detection.    Application Example  Figure 5 shows how the SGM790B can be used in an  application with no host to turn on or off (enable/disable)  a power supply when a load is connected or  disconnected. The power supply is enabled if a load is  connected to either of the load ports (SNS1 or SNS2).
