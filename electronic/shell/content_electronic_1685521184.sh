The output voltage is adjustable  up to 24V using the internal reference voltage. This  device has 2.5A output current capability and operates  at an almost fixed quasi-constant frequency (depending  on VOUT setting). With light load, the inductor current  reaches zero in each cycle (DCM operation) and the  device shifts into power-save mode in which frequency  drops and becomes load dependent to maintain high  efficiency.  The SGM61720 offers a broad set of features including  input under-voltage lockout, internal soft-start, short-  circuit protection, current limiting and thermal shutdown.  Using COT architecture, the device is capable of high  step-down conversion ratios while offering excellent  transient response with no need for loop compensation.  The SGM61720 is available in a Green SOIC-8 (Exposed  Pad) package.  "}'

This device provides  superior line and load regulations, cycle-by-cycle current  limit, fast transient response and pre-biased startup  capability, all with a simple passive compensation  network. An internal precision reference voltage and a  fixed soft-start timer are included. Several protection  features such as input under-voltage lockout, output  over-voltage protection, short-circuit, cycle-by- cycle  over-current protection, and thermal shutdown are  integrated to ensure safe operation.  Constant On-Time Control  In conventional voltage mode control (VMC) or current  mode control (CMC) converters, a fixed frequency clock  timing signal generates a sawtooth ramp that is  compared with the compensation network output to  adjust the PWM duty cycle (on-time) as control variable  and regulate the output voltage. The compensator uses  the voltage and/or current feedback(s) to govern the  control variable and keep the output regulated with fast  reaction to load or VIN variations. The existence of the  compensator in VMC or CMC converter inherently  introduces some delay in the loop response. Unlike  VMC or CMC, the constant on-time (COT) control is a  hysteretic mode control without any clock signal or  compensation amplifier.

Output voltage is  sensed by the feedback (FB) pin through an output  resistor divider and is compared to the internal reference  voltage (VREF) with a low gain error amplifier. The  amplifier output is sent to a comparator and when the  feedback voltage (VFB) falls below VREF, the comparator  triggers the on-time control logic that turns on the  high-side switch. The on-time (tON) is determined by VIN  as approximated by Equation 1:  = × + − ON DELAY IN 0.158 (MΩ) t  (μs) 96 t V 0.4        (1)   where tDELAY is almost 50ns (0.05µs). For higher VIN  values, the -0.4V term can be ignored.  At the end of the on-time, the high-side MOSFET is  turned off and after a very short dead-time the low-side  MOSFET is turned on. The dead-time is implemented  in the drivers to prevent shoot-through. The off-time  continues until the VFB falls below VREF threshold again  and ripple comparator triggers a new on-time pulse.  Each cycle starts when the VFB falls below VREF. The  controller does not allow the off-time to be shorter than  200ns (MIN) to ensure enough charge is received by  the bootstrap capacitor for powering the high-side  driver and also to provide sufficient time for the current  sensing circuit in the low-side switch to measure  current. The short blanking time is required to avoid  switching transition noise that may interfere with the  current measurement.  Figure 3 shows the basic timings of the COT converter  when it is operating in continuous conduction mode  (CCM) in which the inductor current stays above zero  during the whole switching cycle. With light load, the  inductor current reaches zero that will be discussed  later. During the on-time, the inductor current has a  rising slope and during the off-time it will be decreasing.  The next on-time pulse starts when the VFB falls below  VREF threshold. The required VFB ripple (peak-to-peak)  range for proper detection by ripple amplifier and  comparator for stable PWM operation is roughly  between 30mV to 200mV. Note that based on the  operating principle of the COT converter, the ripple has  to be in phase with the inductor ripple for stable  operation, that is, when the inductor current is at its  valley and the on-time needs to be started, the VFB  voltage should also be at the lowest to trigger the  comparator and start the on-pulse in the right time. If  there is a considerable phase delay in the ripple, the  on-pulses start at the wrong times and COT pulse  timing will not be stable (unstable frequency). With low  ESR capacitors, lack of proper ripple phase or  magnitude may occur, and cause stability issues as will  be discussed later.

High Efficiency, 2.5A, 60V Input  SGM61720  Synchronous Buck Converter      10  MAY 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued)  A Deeper Look into the Ripple  In COT control, the sensed ripple valleys determine the  switching cycle timing, therefore the ripple must be  clean from high frequency noise and appear with  proper magnitude and phase on the FB pin (with  respect to inductor current ripple) for stable operation. A  real output capacitor has a parasitic ESR (equivalent  series resistance) that results in two main components  in the output voltage ripple (∆VOUT). Almost all inductor  current ripple (AC component or ∆IL) passes through  the output capacitor while the DC current (IL) goes to  the load. The AC current multiplied by the ESR of the  capacitor produces the ESR component of the voltage  ripple (Vrr = ESR ⨯ ∆IL) that is clearly in phase with the  inductor ripple. However, the capacitive ripple component  is due to the AC voltage variation of the capacitor which  is caused by the charge and discharge with the inductor  AC current. For the component (harmonic) of the  inductor current, the capacitive ripple is almost (Vcr ≈  ∆IL/8fSC) which is 90° lag compared to the resistive  ripple (Vrr) component.   The actual ripple includes higher order switching  harmonics, but the main harmonic (at fS) is usually the  dominant component and by ignoring the higher order  components, the overall phase lag of the output voltage  ripple is estimated by the relative magnitudes of  resistive (ESR) and capacitive ripple components (ESR  and │ZC│=1/2πfSC). The phase lag is given by  tan-1((2πfSC⨯ESR)-1). All lags and delays caused by the  feedback network, parasitic elements of the FB path and  the amplifier/comparator delays, should be considered for  the evaluation of the actual feedback phase lag that  affect the stability.   As an example, for a 100μF ceramic capacitor with  ESR = 2mΩ and operating at fS = 500kHz, the phase  lag will be around 57° that is significant. However, for a  300μF capacitor with ESR = 10mΩ operating at 1MHz,  the lag will be only 3°. Higher switching frequency may  improve stability; however, significant phase lag may  be introduced by the low gain amplifier and comparator  at higher frequencies. Moreover, minimum on-time will  limit the step-down ratio at higher frequencies, so a  compromised frequency should to be considered.  Higher output capacitance is usually implemented by  paralleling more capacitors that inherently reduces the  total effective ESR of the output capacitor due to  parallel operation. While high ESR is not normally  desired for better efficiency and higher RMS current  handling (less heating) in the capacitors, it is generally  preferred for stable COT operation. Therefore, a  compromise is always needed for proper design of  output capacitor to satisfy design requirements.   As ceramic capacitors are now commonly used for  most applications, some ripple injection techniques are  presented for stable operation of COT converters with  low ESR capacitors as will be explained later.  Power Supply Select  The power for internal circuit is taken from VIN when  VOUT is less than 5V, during power-up or when VOUT  setting is less than 5V. When VOUT > 5V, the internal  power supply will switch to the VOUT to reduce losses.  Power-Save Mode  Considering power usage, the SGM61720 has three  main operating modes: PWM mode, power-save mode  and sleep mode. When the SGM61720 operates in  continuous conduction mode (CCM) with heavy load,  the device operates in PWM mode with an almost  constant frequency. When it operates in discontinuous  conduction mode (DCM) with light load, the SGM61720  goes into the power-save mode in which internal power  dissipation is significantly reduced. Moreover, the  operating frequency starts to drop depending on the  load. At very light load and when the off-time exceeds  10μs, device goes to the sleep mode to lower internal  dissipation.  The details are explained in Figure 4 that shows the  timings of the COT control in DCM. Inductor current (IL)  is monitored with a zero-crossing detector and when IL  crosses the zero and goes slightly negative, both  high-side and low-side MOSFETs are turned off (if VFB >  0.575V). They will not turn on again until the VFB falls  below VREF and triggers a new on-time pulse. During  this off-time period, all non-essential circuits are shut  down to minimize losses and the load is supplied by the  output capacitor stored energy. The control circuitry  wakes up when the new on-pulse is triggered. When  the time between successive high-side pulses (t1) is  longer than 10μs, the device goes into sleep mode in  which the system current dissipation is only about  90μA.

Wake up from Discontinuous Conduction Mode   Figure 4. Power-Save Mode (DCM)  Reference Voltage  With the 0.575V internal precision reference voltage, it  is possible to set the output voltage down to 0.575V.  The accuracy of the internal reference is ±2.5% at +25℃  and ±3% across -40℃ to +125℃ junction temperature.  A resistor divider between the output voltage, VOUT  (connected to the OUT input pin) and the FB pin,  programs the output voltage as given in the Equation 2:    = × +     1 OUT REF 2 R V V 1 R            (2)  where R1 and R2 are the upper and lower resistors of  the voltage divider between OUT and GND pins.  Current limit  When an over-current occurs on the output, it will be  reflected on the SW node current. If the current in the  high-side switch exceeds its limit (almost 4.5A), the  high-side switch will automatically be turned off and  after a short dead-time, the low-side switch will be  turned on to take over the current in the inductor. If the  low-side switch current falls below 1.5A the current will  be considered normal and high-side switch will be  turned on again.  Output Over-Voltage Protection (OVP)  If the sensed voltage on the FB pin exceeds 110% of the  nominal value, it is considered an over-voltage event on  the output (VOUT_OV) and the device goes into the  over-voltage protection status.  Upon occurrence of an OVP, switching stops and both  high-side and low-side switches remain off. Due to the  excellent sink and source capability of the synchronous  output stage, in most cases, the error amplifier will be  able to maintain output in regulation and bring voltage  back to normal. If a higher external voltage is accidently  shorted to the converter output, an OVP event is  triggered to protect the low-side switch. In any case, the  regulator will automatically recover if the OVP fault is  cleared.  Thermal Shutdown (TSD)  The SGM61720 monitors junction temperature and will  stop PWM switching if it becomes too hot. If the junction  temperature exceeds +160 ℃ (TYP), the device is  forced to stop switching. It will recover automatically  when TJ the junction temperature decreases by  approximately 30℃.  Ripple Injection  The SGM61720 is a COT control device in which the  PWM timing is based on the output voltage ripple  feedback to the FB pin. As explained before, every time  the VFB voltage falls below VREF threshold, the high-side  switch is turned on and the inductor current starts to  rise. High-side switch is kept on for a constant on-time  which is determined by VIN as explained in Equation 1.  At the end of on-time, the high-side switch is turned off  and after a very short dead-time, the low-side switch is  turned on (off-time) and current in the inductor starts to  decrease. The next on-time and current rise in the  inductor start when the VFB falls below VREF threshold  again. Therefore, in COT control the ripple initiates  each cycle and there is no clock signal for switching.       High Efficiency, 2.5A, 60V Input  SGM61720  Synchronous Buck Converter      12  MAY 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued)  The required VFB peak-to-peak ripple range for stable  PWM operation is between 30mV to 200mV. At high  output voltage applications (typically VOUT > 5V), the  natural output ripple is usually large enough for proper  PWM operation because the output filter is usually  designed such that the output ripple magnitude is  roughly 1% to 2% of the output voltage. However, in  some design conditions like low output voltage  applications, such as a 1V, the output voltage ripple is  usually low (e.g. 10mV) and it will not be possible to get  enough in phase ripple on the FB pin without a new  strategy.   In fact, the ripple feedback is even lower than output  ripple due to the voltage divider. If the FB ripple is small,  the internal amplifier and comparator are not able to  sense that and the control will be lost. In such condition,  the output voltage is either not regulated or has large  ripple due to missing or wrong multiple pulses. With the  low ESR output capacitors such as ceramic ones, the  ripple is also small. Therefore ripple injection methods  are proposed for low output ripple applications to avoid  instability.  Remember that naturally, the output ripple (∆VOUT) has  two main components. One is in phase with inductor  ripple and is produced by the inductor AC current going  through the output capacitors (Vrr = ESR ⨯ ∆IL), and the  other one that has a lag phase is due to the charge and  discharge of capacitor by ∆IL current in each cycle  (estimated by Vcr ≈ ∆IL/8fsC). The output capacitor C is  usually designed large enough to filter switching ripples  such that ∆VOUT and output peak transients in response  to load changes, remain within the acceptable range in  the application. Too large output capacitor may result in  startup issues.   Three main cases can be classified based on the  amount of peak-to-peak feedback ripple (ΔVFB) and the  ripple injection technique used for COT converters.   Case1: If the output capacitor has large ESR, the  output ripple at the FB pin is mainly due to the ESR that  carries the inductor current ripple (see Figure 5). If the  output voltage is small (R2 is large compared to R1) the  ripples seen by FB pin are large enough and with  proper phase. In this case converter has a stable  operation without any ripple injection. The stability  criterion is:  < × × ON OUT t 2 ESR C                (3)  The feedback voltage ripple is given by Equation 4:  ≈ × × 2 FB L 1 2 R ΔV ESR ΔI R  + R             (4)  where:  ΔIL = peak-to-peak value of the inductor current ripple.  SGM61720 L SW FB R1 R2 ESR COUT   Figure 5. Feedback Circuit when Enough Ripple at FB Pin    Case 2: In this case, the in-phase ripple of the output is  large enough, but it is weakened by the resistor divider  (R2 is large compared to R1). As shown in Figure 6, a  small feed-forward capacitor (CFF), across the upper  resistor (R1) bypasses the resistor divider at the ripple  frequency (fS) and the ripple seen on the FB pin is  essentially the same as the output voltage ripple (not  weakened by the divider). The other advantage of  using CFF is the improvement of the converter transient  response, because feeding back the actual over/under-  voltage transients of the output with no weakening  helps a quicker reaction and faster response to  transients. In fact, it is sometimes used for applications  like Case 1 for better transient response. However, the  drawback of CFF is that it may worsen the regulation of  the converter output. Typically, the CFF value is chosen  between 1nF and 100nF (the impedance is typically a  few ohms to a few hundred ohms).  SGM61720 L SW FB R1 R2 ESR COUT CFF   Figure 6. Use of Feed-Forward Capacitor when  Inadequate Ripple at FB Pin       High Efficiency, 2.5A, 60V Input  SGM61720  Synchronous Buck Converter      13  MAY 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued)  With the feed-forward capacitor, the feedback voltage  ripple is very close to the output voltage ripple.  ≈ × FB L ΔV ESR ΔI               (5)  It is generally recommended to choose smaller values  for R1 and R2. Also, the time constant seen by CFF  should be much longer than switching period, that is  ((R1||R2) × CFF≫ 1 fS ).  Case 3: In modern designs, ceramic capacitors are  extensively used due to their small size and good  stability. Due to very low ESR of the output capacitors,  there is virtually no ripple at the FB pin. This is usually  more critical at low output voltage in which lower output  ripple is required (typically less than 20mV). Therefore,  additional ripple (in phase with inductor current) needs  to be injected artificially into the FB pin to keep stable  switching. The additional ripple can be injected from the  switching SW node by a series resistor (RINJ) and  capacitor (CINJ), as shown in Figure 7.  SGM61720 SW FB R1 R2 ESR COUT CFF RINJ CINJ L   Figure 7. Ripple Injection from SW Pin    Note that if too much ripple is injected, the transient  response will get worse, because the impact of the  actual output variations on the feedback signal is  reduced. The key point is that the ripple should be kept  as small as possible without losing the stability. It is  recommended to keep  ΔVFB between 30mV to 200mV.  The process of sizing the ripple injection resistor and  capacitors in Figure 7 is as follows:  • Select CFF to feed all output ripples into the feedback  pin. The impedance of CFF should be small compared  to the feedback divider impedance at the desired  switching frequency. The impedance of the feedback  network is the parallel combination of R1||R2. The  impedance of CFF at the switching frequency can be  taken to be about one tenth of this value.  × π 1 2 FF S 1 2 10 (R +R ) C  =  2 f R R                  (6)  • Select RINJ. When SW voltage is equal to VIN, the  current injected in the feed-forward capacitor CFF is  calculated as (VIN-VOUT)/RINJ, neglecting the DC  resistance of inductor and the small amount of current  flowing through R1 and R2. Given an injected voltage  ripple  ΔVFB  into the feedback node, RINJ can be  calculated as:  − × ∆ ON IN OUT INJ FF FB t V V R  = C V               (7)  • Select CINJ as DC blocking capacitor which should be  3 to 4 times larger than the CFF.  4 = × INJ FF C C                    (8)         High Efficiency, 2.5A, 60V Input  SGM61720  Synchronous Buck Converter      14  MAY 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  "}'

Larger peak-to-peak current ripple increases the power  dissipation in the inductor and MOSFETs. Larger output  current ripple also requires more output capacitance to  smooth out the larger current ripple. Smaller peak-to-  peak current ripple requires a larger inductance value  and therefore a larger and more expensive inductor.  Output Capacitors  The output capacitors and inductor filter the AC part of  the PWM switching voltage and provide an acceptable  level of output voltage ripple superimposed on the  desired output DC voltage. Capacitors also store  energy to help maintaining of the output voltage  regulation during a load transient. The output voltage  ripple (ΔVOUT) depends on the output capacitor value at  the operating voltage and temperature (℃) and its  parasitics (ESR and ESL):  − ∆ ∆ = ∆× + × + IN OUT L OUT L S V V I V I ESR ESL L 8f C      (13)  The voltage rating of the output capacitors should be  selected  with  enough  margins  to  ensure  that  capacitance drop (voltage and temperature derating) is  not significant. The type of output capacitors will  determine which terms of Equation 13 are dominant.  For ceramic output capacitors, the ESR and ESL are  virtually zero so the output voltage ripple will be  dominated by the capacitive term.  ∆ ∆ ≈ L OUT S I V 8f C                 (14)  To reduce the voltage ripple either switching frequency  or the total capacitance is increased. Inductance may  also be increased to reduce the inductor current ripple.  For electrolytic output capacitors, the value of  capacitance is relatively high, and the third term in  Equation 13 can be ignored compared to the ESR and  ESL terms:  − ∆ = ∆× + × IN OUT OUT L V V V I ESR ESL L       (15)     High Efficiency, 2.5A, 60V Input  SGM61720  Synchronous Buck Converter      15  MAY 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued)  Higher quality capacitors, larger inductance or using  parallel capacitors can help reduce the output ripple in  a design using electrolytic output capacitors. The ESR  of some commercial electrolytic capacitors can be quite  high, and it is recommended to use quality capacitors  with the ESR or the total impedance clearly  documented in their datasheet. ESR of an electrolytic  capacitor may increase significantly at cold ambient  temperatures with a factor of 10 or so, which increases  the ripple and can deteriorate the regulator stability.  The transient response of the regulator also depends  on the quantity and type of output capacitors. In general,  reducing the ESR of the output capacitance will result  in a better transient response. The ESR can be  minimized by simply adding more capacitors in parallel  or by using higher quality capacitors. When a fast load  transient of magnitude ∆I and rate of di/dt occurs, the  output voltage will jump or dip by a transient magnitude  of ∆VOUT:  ∆ ∆× + × OUT di V = I ESR ESL dt           (16)  Right after the transient, the inductor current remains  almost constant especially for larger inductors and the  transient current is carried by the capacitor. The output  voltage will deviate from its nominal value for a short  time depending on the system bandwidth, the inductor  and the output capacitance. Eventually, the error  amplifier and feedback bring the output voltage back to  its nominal value. A higher bandwidth is usually  preferred to get shorter settling time; however, it may  be more difficult to get acceptable gain and phase  margins.     Input Capacitors  Four parameters of the input capacitors should be  considered in the design: capacitance value, ESR,  current rating and voltage rating. The capacitance  value should be large enough and ESR must be small  enough to limit the input voltage ripples much less than  the hysteresis of the input for UVLO (VUVLO_HYS). This  value is nominally 700mV for the SGM61720. The  worst case occurs at full load and minimum input  voltage. The CIN voltage rating should have adequate  design margin to handle the highest expected input  surge voltage. Also, the capacitance drop (derating) at  maximum operating voltage and the worst ambient  temperature must be considered for the design. Finally,  the capacitor RMS current rating must be higher than  the expected RMS input current to the regulator with  the temperature derating considerations. Note that the  input current has two main AC components that both  should circulate in the input capacitor and only the DC  component of regulator input must be taken from the  source. The AC current in the input capacitor includes a  high frequency component caused by switching  transients (due to the hard switching and gate driving)  and a main AC component caused by the inductor  ripple at the switching frequency. To decouple these  two currents, typically the two capacitor types should  be paralleled. Small low-ESR ceramic capacitor is used  right beside the IN and GND pins of the regulator to  carry the high frequency switching transients (ringings)  and larger capacitor is paralleled to carry the inductor  ripple and load transient currents to minimize the input  voltage ripple. The input capacitors must deliver the  RMS current according to:  RMS O I I D (1 D) = × −                (17)  where the duty cycle is D ≈ VOUT/VIN. For example, at D  = 20% duty cycle, the input/output current multiplier is  0.40. Therefore, if the regulator is delivering 3A of  steady-state load current, the input capacitor(s) must  support an RMS current of 1.2A (0.40 × 3A).               High Efficiency, 2.5A, 60V Input  SGM61720  Synchronous Buck Converter      16  MAY 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued)  The input capacitor(s) must limit the voltage deviations  at the IN pin to something significantly less than the  UVLO hysteresis during maximum load and minimum  input voltage. Considering a conservative factor of 0.83  for frequency deviation, the minimum input capacitance  can be calculated as follows:  × × − × × ∆ OUT IN S IN(MIN) I ∆(1 ∆) C >1.2 f V            (18)  where ΔVIN(MIN) is chosen to be much less than the  hysteresis of the VIN UVLO comparator (ΔVIN(MIN) ≤  150mV is recommended), and fS is the nominal PWM  frequency. The D × (1 - D) term in Equation 18 has an  absolute maximum value of 0.25 at 50% duty cycle. So,  for example, a very conservative design based on IOUT  = 2A, and VOUT = 5V (fS = 316kHz), D × (1 - D) = 0.25,  and ΔVIN = 150mV.  × ≥ × × IN 2A 0.25 C 1.2 =12.7 F 316kHz 150mV μ         (19)  As discussed before, DC bias effect (voltage derating)  on the ceramic capacitors needs to be considered. The  capacitance drop with voltage is huge with the Y5V and  Z5U temperature characteristic ceramic capacitors (as  much as 90% reduction) and these types should be  avoided. The X5R and X7R type capacitors are the  primary choices due to their stability against DC bias  and temperature. The DC bias drop effect is larger for  smaller  physical  capacitor  sizes,  however,  the  self-resonance frequency of larger package capacitors  is typically lower, so a compromise is needed.  Self-resonance frequency of the capacitor should be  higher than the expected operating frequency range of  the capacitor. Beyond the resonant, the impedance of  the capacitor will be more inductive rather than  capacitive. Self-resonance of the HF decoupling input  capacitors must be higher than the converter switching  noise and ringing frequency. It can be several times  higher than switching frequency. For this design, two  10uF capacitors are used for the input decoupling. To  improve high frequency filtering, a small parallel 0.22uF  capacitor is recommended to place as close as  possible to IN pin.
