It is designed to replace  passive LC filters and drivers with an integrated device.  Compared with typical passive solutions, the four  6th-order Butterworth filters provide better image  quality than typical passive solutions. One channel is  Standard Definition (SD) filter while the rest three  channels are High Definition (HDi) filters.  The device has a 6dB gain, allowing DC- or  AC-coupled output. SGM9128YP can be DC-coupled  or AC-coupled with input video signal to eliminate  out-of-band noise, such as the output stage of DAC.  Internal clamp circuitry may be used if AC-coupled  inputs are required.  SGM9128YP is available in a Green MSOP-10  (Exposed Pad) package. It operates over an ambient  temperature range of -40℃ to +85℃.    "}'

Exposure to  absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods  may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any  conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended  Operating Conditions section is not implied.    ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION  This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are  not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all  integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions.  Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures  can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle  performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision  integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage  because even small parametric changes could cause the  device not to meet the published specifications.
