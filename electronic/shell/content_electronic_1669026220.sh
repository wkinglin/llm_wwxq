To reduce voltage drop for low  voltage and high current rails, the device implements a  low on-resistance N-MOSFET which reduces the  dropout voltage across the device.   The configurable rise time of the device greatly reduces  inrush current caused by large bulk load capacitances  or hot-plug boards, thereby the power supply droop will  be reduced or eliminated. The current limit threshold  can be programmed between 0.1A and 1.2A through  an external resistor.   When the output load exceeds the current limit  threshold or a short-circuit event is present, the device  limits the output current to a safe level by increasing the  on-resistance of the power switch. Continuous heavy  overloads and short-circuits that increase power  dissipation of the switch can cause the junction  temperature to rise, in which case thermal protection  circuit will shut off the switch to prevent damage.     Enable and Adjusting Under-Voltage  Lockout (UVLO)  The EN/nFAULT pin can control the state of the switch.  Pulling the EN/nFAULT pin high enables the device.  Logic high of VENR on the EN/nFAULT pin will enable  the device and VENF will turn it off.   IN EN/nFAULT EN 1.39V 1.33V - + GND VIN R1 R2 SGM2523C/D < 27V Zener  Diode   Figure 5. UVLO Thresholds Set by R1 and R2     As shown in Figure 5, the under-voltage locking  threshold is programmed by an external resistor divider  (R1 and R2) from the power input terminal to the  EN/nFAULT terminal to the GND.  Once the input rails under-voltage, the N-MOSFET will  be turned off quickly. If this function is not needed,  connect the EN/nFAULT pin to the VIN rail to avoid it  happens. Do not leave the EN/nFAULT pin floating.   The device implements the input UVLO and sets two  UVLOs in combination with EN/nFAULT. If VEN/nFAULT <  VENF, the device is disabled and EN/nFAULT can set  the VIN rise threshold, so the device can set the section  active voltage to avoid the input rail fluctuation.  When the switching voltage of the devices is more than  15V, a Zener diode of no more than 27V (> 0.5W)  should be added to prevent the input voltage spike from  damaging the device (as shown in Figure 5).    EN/nFAULT as Output Port  When any of over-current protection or over-temperature  protection  occurs, the  device sinks current from  EN/nFAULT, pulling the pin down to alert the host.  EN/nFAULT changes back to an input port, only after  the device is released from a protection action.

EN/nFAULT Application    Inrush Current Control  The SGM2523C/D are designed to control the inrush  current when the devices are enable or power-on. The  capacitor between SS and GND pins will set the slew  rate according to the application requirements. An  approximate formula for the relationship between CSS  and slew rate is shown in Equation 1:  = × SS OUT SS SS C dV I GAIN dt               (1)  where:  ISS = 1μA (TYP)  dVOUT/dt = Target output slew rate  GAINSS = ΔVOUT/ΔVSS = 6.25  CSS (MAX) must be less than 1μF.

Output Ramp Time is Set by CSS    Equation 2 shows how to calculate the total output  ramp time (tSS) when the output rises from 0V to VIN:  tSS = 16.1 × 104 × VIN × CSS         (2)  where CSS is in F.  Inrush current can be calculated by the following  formula.  = × IN INRUSH OUT SS V I C t                (3)    Rise time can be calculated by multiplying the input  voltage by the slew rate. If floating this pin, the slew  rate of the output obtains a default value ~50V/ms  (minimum tSS).           Power SOA         Figure 8. Power SOA    Over-Current and Short-Circuit Protections  The device limits current to the output in case of output  shorts and overloads. If an event occurs, device goes  into current limit action, and the value of the current  limit (ILIMIT) is set by RILIM resistor:  ILIMIT = 10.5 × 10-3 × RILIM          (4)  − = × LIMIT ILIM 3 I R 10.5 10              (5)  where:  ILIMIT is overload current limit in A.  RILIM is the current limit programming resistor in kΩ.  In addition to the general over-current protection, the  SGM2523C/D also integrate fast-trip over-current  protection with quicker response time.    Overload Protection  Once an overload occurs, the internal current limit  amplifier limits the output current to the predetermined  value by increasing the on-resistance of the power  switch.  During current limit regulation, the output voltage drops,  resulting in increased power consumption. The  SGM2523C/D allow ILIM pin floating operation. If ILIM  pin is floating, the current limit will be set as fixed 0.2A  internally.   When the over-current limit condition lasts more than  2ms, the SGM2523C enters the hiccup mode with 2ms  on time and 700ms off time, whereas the SGM2523D  enters shutdown mode.    Short-Circuit Protection  A transient short-circuit occurs, due to the limited  bandwidth of the current limit amplifier, which cannot  respond quickly to this event. The SGM2523C/D  contain a fast-trip comparator with a threshold  (IFAST-TRIP). If IOUT > IFAST-TRIP, the comparator turns off  the N-MOSFET and terminates the short-circuit peak  current across the N-MOSFET rapidly. The fast-trip  threshold is 2 times the overload current limit. The  fast-trip comparator can terminate the transient  short-circuit peak current, and then the current limit  function limits the output current to ILIMIT.  IFAST-TRIP = 2 × ILIMIT                   (6)  where:  IFAST-TRIP is the fast-trip current limit threshold, which is  measured in A.          0 5 10 15 20 25 30 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Input Voltage (V)  CSS (nF)  RILIM = 60kΩ  RILIM = 100kΩ  TJ = +25℃   SGM2523C  SGM2523D  Programmable Current Limit Switches      11  NOVEMBER 2022    SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued)  After the fast-trip is triggered, the fast-trip circuit will first  make the FET turn off for several microseconds, and  then the device enters the current limit start-up period,  where the output current is limited to ILIMIT. After this  period, the behavior of the device is the same as that of  over-current.  IFAST-TRIP Current (A) ILIMIT IFAST-TRIP = 2 × ILIMIT     Figure 9. Over-Current Protection Levels    Start-Up and IOUT  During the power-up, the IOUT is equal to the smaller  one of Equation 3 and Equation 4.    IN, OUT and GND  To limit the voltage drop on the input supply caused by  transient inrush current when the switch turns on into a  discharged load capacitor, a capacitor needs to be  placed between IN and GND pins. Use a bypass  capacitor as close as possible between IN and GND  pins. Due to the integrated body diode in the  N-MOSFET, it is highly recommended that CIN should  be greater than COUT. When the system power supply is  removed, if COUT is greater than CIN, it will cause VOUT to  exceed VIN.  This will result in current flow through the body diode  from VOUT to VIN. A CIN to COUT ratio of 10 to 1 is  recommended for minimizing VIN dip caused by inrush  currents during start-up. VOUT in the on state can be  calculated as Equation 7:  VOUT = VIN - (RDS(ON) × IOUT)        (7)  where RDS(ON) is the resistance of the FET during  on-state.  GND terminal is the ground pin, which is the most  negative voltage in the chip. GND is the negative  terminal of all other terminals unless otherwise  specified.    Thermal Shutdown  Thermal shutdown protects the device from excessive  temperature. Once the device is shut down due to TSD  fault, it will either stay latch-off (SGM2523D) or restart  automatically after TJ drops below [TTSD - 20 ℃]  (SGM2523C). When over-temperature protection is  triggered, the EN/nFAULT pin is pulled low to indicate  the fault signal.    Shutdown Control  By keeping the EN/nFAULT pin below its VENF threshold,  the internal FET and load current can be turned off  remotely.    Operational Overview  The device function is shown in Table 1.  Table 1. Device Functions  Device  SGM2523C and SGM2523D  Start-Up  Inrush ramp controlled by SS pin via an external  capacitor.   Limit inrush current to ILIMIT level.   If TJ > TTSD, device shuts off.  Over-Current  Response  Current is limited to ILIMIT level.  Power dissipation increases as VIN - VOUT grows.  TJ > TTSD, the device is turned off.   SGM2523C will attempt restart tTSD_DLY ms after TJ <  [TTSD -20°C].  SGM2523D remains off.  Short-Circuit  Response  Fast shut off when ILOAD > IFAST-TRIP.  Quick restart and current limited to ILIMIT, follows  standard start-up cycle.    The SGM2523C/D provide a complete set of protection  functions for overload or inrush current. The wide  operating voltage range (2.6V to 22V) is specifically  designed for many popular DC buses, and the  maximum load current of 1.2A can meet the power  delivery requirements of many devices.

These power supplies generally have a rated power of  5W - 30W, which is generally characterized by high  efficiency, low cost and few components. However,  there are also the following shortcomings:  • No secondary-side protection which can stop short-  circuit and other key faults immediately.  • Cannot provide precision current limit for overload  transients.  • Poor ability to regulate the output voltage during  sudden fluctuation of the AC input voltage, when the  output over-voltage condition is triggered.  Therefore, accurate current sensing and overload  protection are required for the secondary side output  port in the above applications. This requires the use of  precision operational amplifiers for additional circuit  implementation. It adds complexity to the solution and  leads to a loss of sensing. The SGM2523C/D adopting  N-MOSFET with low on-resistance is a simple and  efficient solution. The typical application circuit of  SGM2523C/D is shown in Figure 10.  During short-circuit fault, the internal fast comparator  shuts down the FET within 0.3μs after the input current  increases rapidly and exceeds IFAST-TRIP which is set by  the external RILIM resistor.   Furthermore, the SGM2523C/D provide inrush current  limit during the output ramp up procedure.    Precision Current Limit in Intrinsic Safety  Applications  The safe operation of electrical and electronic  equipment in dangerous area environment has a more  and more urgent requirements for intensive safety (IS).  IS requires that the total energy available during  equipment operation is not enough to ignite the  surrounding explosive environment by means of  electric sparks or heat transfer. This requires precision  current limits to ensure that the set current limits are not  exceeded over a wide operating temperature range and  variable environmental conditions. Applications such as  gas analyzers, medical devices, portal industrial  equipment, etc., need to meet these importance safety  standards. As a simple over-voltage and over-load  protection solution, SGM2523C/D are applicable to  each power rail inside the system application.

It also  provides protection in case of failure. Figure 12 shows  a typical discrete implementation of load switch, which  requires more components and more complex circuits  to achieve fault protection. The SGM2523C/D can be  used as a load switch for the applications whose  operating range is from 2.6V to 22V. Programmable  current limits, programmable soft-start, over-temperature  protection, fault flag and under-voltage lockout are provided  in the SGM2523C/D.  Used as a load switch, Figure 12 shows a typical  implementation of SGM2523C/D, which is used for  driving a solenoid and fan control. Freewheeling diode  is recommended for the highly inductive load.    SGM2523C/D VIN RILIM Load ILIM EN/nFAULT Enable Over-Current Protection UVLO VIN R1 R2 Q1 CS Disable Q1     Figure 12.
