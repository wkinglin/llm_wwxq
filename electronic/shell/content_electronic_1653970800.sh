It can deliver up to  1.2A to the output over a wide input voltage range of  4.5V to 42V. It is suitable for various industrial  applications with high input voltage or for power  conditioning from unregulated sources. Moreover, the  low 55µA quiescent current and ultra-low shutdown  current of only 1.2µA make it a suitable choice for  battery-powered applications.  SGM61412 features high efficiency over a wide load  range achieved by scaling down the switching frequency  at light load condition to reduce switching and gate  driving  losses.  Other  features  include  internal  compensation, internal monotonic soft-start even with  pre-biased output and fast loop response due to the  peak-current mode controller. Switching at 1.2MHz, the  SGM61412 can prevent EMI noise problems, such as  the ones found in AM radio, ADSL and PLC applications.  Protection features include current limit and short-circuit  protection, thermal shutdown with auto recovery and  output over-voltage protection. Frequency fold-back helps  prevent inductor current runaway during startup.  The SGM61412 is available in a Green TSOT-23-6  package. It operates over a wide ambient temperature  range of -40℃ to +125℃.  "}'

It is designed for high reliability and is  particularly suitable for power conditioning from  unregulated sources or battery-powered applications  that need low sleep and shutdown currents. It also  features a power-save mode in which operating  frequency is adaptively reduced under light load  condition to reduce switching and gate losses and keep  high efficiency. At no load and with switching stopped,  the total operating current is approximately 55μA. If the  device is disabled, the total consumption is typically  1.2μA.  Figure 2 shows the functional block diagram of the  SGM61412. The two integrated MOSFET switches of  the power stage are both over-current protected and  can provide up to 1.2A of continuous current for the  load. Current limit of the switches also prevents  inductor current runaway. The converter switches are  optimized for high efficiency at low duty cycle.  At the beginning of each switching cycle, the high-side  switch is turned on. This is the time that feedback  voltage (VFB) is below the reference voltage (VREF) and  power must be delivered to the output. After the  on-period, the high-side switch is turned off and the  low-side switch is turned on until the end of switching  cycle. For reliable operation and preventing shoot  through, a short dead time is always inserted between  gate pulses of the converter complimentary switches.  During dead time, both switch gates are kept off.  The device is designed for safe monotonic start-up  even if the output is pre-biased.  If the junction temperature exceeds a maximum  threshold (TSHDN, typically +155℃), thermal shutdown  protection will happen and switching will stop. The  device will automatically recover with soft-start when  the junction temperature drops back well below the trip  point. This hysteresis is typically 30℃.  The SGM61412 has current limit on both the high-side  and low-side MOSFET switches. When current limit is  activated frequency fold-back is also activated. This  occurs in the case of output overload or short circuit.  Note that SGM61412 will continue to provide its  maximum output current and will not shut down. In such  a case, the junction temperature may rise rapidly and  trigger thermal shutdown.  During initial power-up of the device (soft-start), current  limit and frequency fold-back are activated to prevent  inductor current runaway while the output capacitor is  charging to the desired VOUT.    Peak-Current Mode (PWM Control)  Figure 2 shows the functional block diagram and Figure  3 shows the switching node operating waveforms of the  SGM61412. Switching node voltage is generated by  controlling the duty cycles of the complementary  high-side and low-side switches. The high-side duty  cycle is used as control parameter of the Buck  converter to regulate output voltage and is defined as:  D = tON/tSW, where tON is the high-side switch on-time  and tSW is the switching period. When high-side switch  is turned on, the SW pin voltage sharply rises towards  VIN, and the inductor current (IL) starts ramping up with  (VIN - VOUT)/L slope. When high-side switch is turned off,  the low-side switch is turned on after a very short dead  time to avoid shoot-through, and IL ramps down with  -VOUT/L slope. In ideal case, the output voltage is  proportional to the input voltage and duty cycle (D =  VOUT/VIN) if component parasitics are ignored.  The SGM61412 employs fixed-frequency, peak-current  mode control in continuous conduction mode (CCM)  (when inductor minimum current is above zero). In light  load condition (when the inductor current reaches zero)  the SGM61412 will enter discontinuous conduction  mode (DCM) and the control mode will change to  shift-frequency, peak-current mode to reduce the  switching frequency and the associated switching and  gate driving losses (power-save mode).

The controller has  an outer voltage feedback loop to get accurate DC  voltage regulation. The output of the outer loop is fed to  an inner peak-current control loop as reference  command that adjusts the peak- current of the inductor.  The inductor peak-current is sensed from the high-side  switch and is compared to the peak-current reference  to control the duty cycle. In other words, as soon as the  inductor current reaches the reference peak-current  determined by voltage loop, the high-side switch is  turned off and the low-side switch is turned on after  dead time.  The internally compensated voltage feedback loop  allows for simpler design, fewer external components,  and stable operation with almost any combination of  output capacitors.    Power-Save Mode (SGM61412A Only)  The SGM61412A/B operate in PWM mode to provide  lower ripple at heavy load. The SGM61412A operates  in power-save mode (PSM) at light load to boost light  load efficiency by reducing switching and gate drive  losses. When the inductor peak-current is low and the  internal VCOMP falls to the internal threshold, the device  will enter PSM. After entering PSM for a delay time,  some modules are shut down to minimum quiescent  current. The high-side MOSFET will not switch until the  output voltage falls for the internal VCOMP to rise above  the internal threshold. Since the integrated current  comparator catches the inductor peak-current only, the  average load current entering PSM varies with the  applications and external output filters.    Pulse Frequency Mode (SGM61412B Only)  As the load current decreases, the SGM61412B enters  pulse frequency mode (PFM). When the inductor  peak-current is low and the internal VCOMP falls to the  internal threshold, the device will enter PFM. During  PFM, when output feedback voltage VFB falls below  0.83V typically, the device starts a PFM current pulse.  The high-side MOSFET switch is turned on, and the  inductor current ramps up. As the inductor peak-current  rise for the current sense voltage VSENSE reaches the  internal threshold, the switch is turned off and the  low-side MOSFET switch is turned on until the inductor  current becomes zero. The converter effectively  delivers a current to the output capacitor and the load.  The resulting PFM frequency mainly depends on the  load current. The lighter the load, the slower the output  voltage drops, and the lower switching frequency.  Lower switching frequency reduces the switching and  gate drive losses, and improves the efficiency  significantly. The PFM is left and PWM mode entered in  case the output current rise for the internal VCOMP to rise  above the internal threshold.    Floating Driver and Bootstrap Charging  UVLO Protection  The high-side MOSFET driver is powered by a floating  supply provided by an external bootstrap capacitor. The  bootstrap capacitor is charged and regulated to about  5V by the dedicated internal bootstrap regulator. When  the voltage between BOOT and SW nodes is below  regulation, a PMOS pass transistor is turned on and  connected VIN and BOOT pins internally, otherwise it  will be turned off. The power supply for the floating  driver has its own UVLO protection. The rising UVLO  threshold is about 4.25V and with 320mV hysteresis;  the falling threshold is about 3.93V. In case of UVLO,  the reference voltage of the controller is reset to zero  and after recovery a new soft-start process will start.    Minimum High-side On/Off-Time and  Frequency Fold-Back  The shortest duration for the high-side switch on-time  (tON_MIN) is 100ns (TYP). For the off-time (tOFF_MIN) the  minimum value is 120ns (TYP). The duty cycle (or  equivalently the VOUT/VIN ratio) range in CCM operation  is limited by tON_MIN and tOFF_MIN depending on the  switching frequency. Note that at 1.2MHz the total cycle  time is tSW = 833ns.  The minimum and maximum duty cycles without  frequency fold-back are given by Equations 1 and 2:  DMIN = tON_MIN × fSW        (1)  DMAX = 1 - tOFF_MIN × fSW     (2)  For any given output voltage, the highest input voltage  without frequency fold-back can be calculated from:  × OUT IN_MAX SW ON_MIN V V  = f t         (3)  The minimum VIN is estimated by:  × OUT IN_MIN SW OFF_MIN V V  = 1 - f t       (4)   1.2MHz, 1.2A, 42V  SGM61412  Synchronous Buck Converter      13  MAY 2022  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued)  Input Voltage  The SGM61412 can operate efficiently for inputs as  high as 42V. For CCM operation keeps duty cycle  between 12% and 88%.    Output Voltage  The output voltage can be bucked to as low as the  0.83V reference voltage (VREF). As explained before,  when the output voltage is set to 0.83V and there is no  voltage divider, a minimum small load will be needed.  An 80kΩ resistor to ground will prevent the output  voltage floating up.    Soft-Start  The integrated soft-start circuit in SGM61412 limits the  input inrush current right after power-up or enabling the  device. Soft-start is implemented by slowly ramping up  the reference voltage that in turn slowly ramps up the  output voltage to its target regulation value.    Enable  EN pin turns the SGM61412 operation in on or off  condition. If an applied voltage is less than 0.9V, the  device will shut down. If the voltage is more than 1.3V,  the device will start the regulator. The simplest way to  enable the device is to connect the EN pin to VIN pin  via a resistor. This enables the SGM61412 to start up  automatically when VIN is within the operating range.   Many applications will profit from the employment of an  enable divider RENT and RENB (see Figure 4) to build an  accurate system UVLO level for the converter. System  UVLO can be used for supplies operating from utility  power as well as battery power. This feature can be  used for power supply sequencing which is required for  proper power up of the system voltage rails. It can also  be used as protection, such as preventing supply  battery from depletion. Control of the enable input by  logic signals may also be used for sequencing or  protection.

If  the  junction  temperature exceeds +155℃, the switching stops and  the device shuts down. Automatic recovery with an  internal soft-start will begin when the junction  temperature drops below the +125℃ falling threshold.       1.2MHz, 1.2A, 42V  SGM61412  Synchronous Buck Converter      14  MAY 2022  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  "}'

Usually, a design is started by  selecting lower resistor R1 and calculating R2 with the  following equation:    ×     1 OUT REF 2 R V  = V    1 + R        (5)  where VREF = 0.83V.  To keep operating quiescent current small and prevent  voltage errors due to leakage currents, it  is  recommended to choose R1 in the range of 10kΩ to  100kΩ.  The error amplifier is normally able to maintain  regulation since the synchronous output stage has  excellent sink and source capability. However it is not  able to regulate output when the FB pin is disconnected  or when the output is shorted to a higher supply like  input supply. Also when VOUT is set to its minimum  (0.83V) usually there is no voltage divider and VOUT is  directly connected to FB through a resistor (R1 in the  divider) and there is no resistor to ground (no R2). In  such case and with no load, an internal current source  of 5μA ~ 6μA from BOOT into the SW pin, which can  slowly charge the output capacitor and pull VOUT up to  VIN. Therefore a minimum load of at least 10μA must be  always present on VOUT (for example, an 80kΩ resistor:  0.83V/10.4μA = 80kΩ).    Inductor Selection  Higher operating frequency allows the designer to  choose smaller inductor and capacitor values; however,  the switching and gate losses are increased. On the  other hand, at lower frequencies the current ripple (∆IL)  is higher, which results in higher light load losses. Use  Equation 6 to calculate the required inductance (LMIN).  K is the ratio of the inductor peak-to-peak ripple (∆IL) to  the maximum operating DC current (IOUT). The  recommended selection range for K is between 0.2 and  0.4. Choosing a higher K value reduces the selected  inductance, but a too high K factor may result in  insufficient slope compensation. The inductance is  selected based on the desired peak-to-peak ripple  current (ΔIL) for CCM. Equation 7 shows that ∆IL is  inversely proportional to fSW × L and is increased at the  maximum input voltage (VIN_MAX). Therefore by  accepting larger ∆IL values, smaller inductances can be  chosen but the cost is higher output voltage ripple and  increased core losses.   Inductor peak-current should never exceed the  saturation even in transients to avoid over-current  protection. Also inductor RMS rating should always be  larger than operating RMS current even at maximum  ambient temperature.

Note that it is generally desired to choose a smaller  inductance value for faster transient response, smaller  size, and lower DCR.  On the other hand, if the  inductance is too small, current ripple will increase  which can trigger over-current protection. The larger  the ripple of inductance current is, the larger the ripple  of output voltage of output capacitor is. For  peak-current mode control, it is recommended to  choose large current ripple, because controller  comparator performs better with higher signal to noise  ratio. So, for this design example, KIND = 0.4 is chosen,  and the minimum inductor value for 12V input voltage is  calculated to be 5.1µH. The nearest standard value  would be a 6.8µH ferrite inductor with a 2A RMS  current rating and 2.5A saturation current that are well  above the designed converter output current RMS and  DC respectively.       1.2MHz, 1.2A, 42V  SGM61412  Synchronous Buck Converter      16  MAY 2022  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued)  Bootstrap Capacitor Selection  A 0.1μF ceramic capacitor with 16V or higher voltage  rating must be connected between the BOOT-SW pin  to provide the gate drive supply voltage for the  high-side MOSFET. The bootstrap capacitor is  refreshed when the high-side MOSFET is off and the  low-side switch conducts. X7R or X5R dielectric types  are recommended.    Input Capacitor Selection  The input capacitor also provides the high frequency  switching transient currents. So, choosing a low-ESR  and small size capacitor with high self-resonance  frequency and sufficient RMS rating is necessary.  Typically, 10μF high quality ceramic capacitor (X5R,  X7R or better) with voltage rating twice the maximum  input voltage is recommended for decoupling capacitor.  If the source is away from the device (> 5cm), some  bulk capacitances are also needed to damp the voltage  spikes caused by the wiring or PCB trace parasitic  inductances. The value for this capacitor is not critical  but must be rated to handle the maximum input voltage  including ripple.  In this example, one 10μF/50V/X7R capacitor and a  0.1μF ceramic capacitor placed right beside the device  VIN and GND pins for very high-frequency filtering are  used.    Output Capacitor Selection  This device is designed to be used with external LC  filters. The minimum required capacitance to keep cost  and size down and bandwidth high. The main parts for  designing the output capacitance are output voltage  ripple, loop stability and the voltage over/undershoot  during load current transients. So, COUT should be  chosen carefully. The output voltage ripple is determined  of two factors. One is caused by the inductor current  ripple going through the ESR of the output capacitors:  ΔVOUT_ESR = ΔIL × ESR = KIND × IOUT × ESR (8)  The other part is caused by the inductor current ripple  charging and discharging the output capacitors:  IND OUT L OUT_C SW OUT SW OUT K I I V  =  8 f C 8 f C × ∆ ∆ = × × × ×       (9)  These AC components are not in phase and the total  peak-to-peak ripple is less than ΔVOUT_ESR + ΔVOUT_C.  Transient performance specification usually limits  output capacitance if the system requires tight voltage  regulation in presence of large current steps and/or fast  slew rate. The output capacitor must provide the  increased load current or absorb the excess inductor  current (when the load current steps down) until the  control loop can re-adjust the current of the inductor to  the new load level. The control loop of regulator usually  requires 8 or more clock cycles to adjust the inductance  current to the new load level. The output capacitance  must be as large as possible to provide a current  difference of 8 clock cycles to keep the output voltage  within the specified range. Equation 10 shows the  minimum output capacitance required to specify output  overshoot/undershoot.  OH OL OUT SW OUT_SHOOT 8 (I I ) 1 C  > 2 f V × − × × ∆         (10)  where:  IOL = Low level of the output current step during load  transient.  IOH = High level of the output current during load  transient.  VOUT_SHOOT = Target output voltage over/undershoot.  For this design example, the target output ripple is  30mV. Assuming ΔVOUT_ESR = ΔVOUT_C = 30mV, and  choosing KIND = 0.4, Equation 8 requires ESR to be less  than 62.5mΩ and Equation 9 requires COUT > 1.67μF.  The target over/undershoot range of 5V output is  ΔVOUT_SHOOT = 5% × VOUT = 250mV. From Equation 10,  COUT > 16μF. So, in summary, the most stringent  criteria for the output capacitor is transient constrain of  COUT > 16μF. For the derating margin, one 22μF, 10V,  X7R ceramic capacitor with 10mΩ ESR is used.         1.2MHz, 1.2A, 42V  SGM61412  Synchronous Buck Converter      17  MAY 2022  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued)  Layout Guide  Careful layout is always important to ensure good performance and stable operation to any kind of switching  regulator. Place the capacitors close to the device, use the GND pin of the device as the center of star-connection to  other grounds, and minimize the trace area of the SW node.
