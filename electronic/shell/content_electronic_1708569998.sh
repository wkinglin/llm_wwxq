SGM2521/1A/2/2A are  designed for a wide range of applications and can  provide ±7% current limit accuracy at TA = +25℃.  Internal  protection  functions  are  provided  for  over-current protection (OCP), over-voltage protection  (OVP) and under-voltage lockout (UVLO). Fault  conditions are indicated by the nFLT pin.  The threshold accuracy of UV and OV is 3%, which  ensures close monitoring of bus voltage and reduces  the demand of monitoring circuit.  The SGM2521/1A/2/2A are available in Green SOIC-8  and TDFN-2×3-8BL packages and operate over a  temperature range of -40℃ to +85℃.       "}'

To reduce voltage drop  for low voltage and high current rails, the device  implements a low on-resistance N-MOSFET which  reduces the dropout voltage across the device.  The configurable rise time of the device greatly reduces  inrush current caused by large bulk load capacitances  or hot-plug boards, thereby reducing or eliminating  power supply drop. The current limit threshold can be  programmed between 0.26A and 2A through an  external resistor.  When the output load exceeds the current limit  threshold or a short-circuit event is present, the device  limits the output current to a safe level by increasing the  on-resistance of the power switch. Continuous heavy  overloads and short-circuits that increase power  dissipation of the switch can cause the junction  temperature to rise, in which case thermal protection  circuit will shut off the switch to prevent damage.   The device starts its operation by monitoring the VIN  bus. When VIN exceeds the under-voltage lockout  threshold, the device samples the ENUV pin. A high  level on this pin enables the internal N-MOSFET. When  VIN exceeds UVLO threshold and VENUV exceeds 1.38V,  the internal N-MOSFET of the device starts conducting  and allows current to flow from IN to OUT. When VENUV  is held low (below VENF), internal N-MOSFET is turned  off. When the voltage of OVP pin is more than VOVPR,  the internal N-MOSFET is turned off and protects the  downstream load. The device also features a fault flag  output (nFLT) pin to monitor system status and control  downstream load. The device has a thermal protection  feature to protect itself against thermal damage due to  over-temperature.    Adjustable Enable and Under-Voltage  Lockout (UVLO)  The ENUV pin controls the state of the switch. In its  high-state, the internal N-MOSFET is enabled. A low  level on this pin turns off the internal N-MOSFET. High  and low levels are specified in the electrical  characteristics of the datasheet.   It is recommended to add an external bypass capacitor  between ENUV and GND pins to avoid the noise of  instability power or probabilistic power failure. As an  under-voltage lockout pin, the UVLO threshold is  programmed by an external resistor divider, as shown  in Figure 3.   Once the input rail under-voltage occurs, the  N-MOSFET will be turned off quickly. Connect the  ENUV pin to the VIN rail to avoid this function if it is not  needed. Do not leave the ENUV pin floating.   The device implements the input UVLO and sets two  UVLOs in combination with ENUV. If VIN < VUVF, the  device is disabled and ENUV can set the VIN rise  threshold, so the device can set the section active  voltage to avoid the input rail fluctuation.

ENUV and Input OVP Set by R1, R2 and R3    Over-Voltage Protection (OVP)  The SGM2521/1A/2/2A family features over-voltage  protection function. The over-voltage threshold is  programmed by the resistor divider from the power  supply to the OVP terminal and to GND, as shown in  Figure 3. If the voltage of OVP pin is higher than VOVPR,  the device turns off the internal N-MOSFET. If not used,  connect this pin to GND.

The capacitor between SS and GND pins  will set the slew rate according to the application  requirements.  An  approximate  formula  for  the  relationship between CSS and slew rate is shown in  Equation 1:  = × SS OUT SS SS C dV I GAIN dt               (1)  where:  ISS = 1.03μA (TYP)  dVOUT/dt = Target output slew rate  GAINSS = ΔVOUT/ΔVSS = 4.95    SS GND nSWEN 67Ω CINT 1.03μA SGM2521 CSS     Figure 4. Output Ramp Time tSS is Set by CSS  Equation 2 shows how to calculate the total output  ramp time (tSS) when the output rises from 0V to VIN:   tSS = 20.04 × 104 × VIN × CSS          (2)  where CSS is in Farad.  The inrush current (IINRUSH) can be calculated as:  IN INRUSH OUT SS V I C t = ×                (3)    Rise time can be calculated by multiplying the input  voltage by the slew rate. If floating this pin, the slew  rate of the output obtains a default value ~50V/ms  (minimum tSS).  For existing load power on conditions, input maximum  current will be limited to ILIMIT point.  If VOUT is shorted, SGM2521/SGM2521A will try to  restart automatically, the chips have to take all the  power at this time, and CSS needs to be limited to  protect these chips from excessive power damage.

If an event occurs, device goes  into current limit action, and the value of the current  limit (ILIMIT) is set by RILIM resistor:  SGM2521/2:  ILIMIT = 10.95 × 10-3 × RILIM - 0.043       (4)  − = × LIMIT ILIM 3 I +0.043 R 10.95 10                  (5)  SGM2521A/2A:  ILIMIT = 9.78 × 10-3 × RILIM + 0.021       (6)  − = × LIMIT ILIM 3 I −0.021 R 9.78 10                  (7)  where:  ILIMIT is the value of overload current limit in A.  RILIM is the current limit programming resistor in kΩ.  In addition to the general over-current protection, the  SGM2521/1A/2/2A family also integrates fast-trip  over-current protection with quicker response time.  Thermal stress will reduce the limited current to protect  the device shown in Figure 6.  Internal current limit comparator bias voltage is set by  bias current and external resistor, no noise interference  and high precision resistor increase current limit  accuracy.     Overload Protection  When the output load exceeds the current limit  threshold, the internal current limit amplifier limits the  output current to the predetermined value by increasing  the  on-resistance of the  power switch. When  continuous heavy overloads increase the power  dissipation in the switch, causing the junction  temperature to reach the thermal shutdown threshold,  the internal N-MOSFET is turned off. The fault pin  (nFLT) is asserted and will be pulled low to indicate a  fault until the thermal shutdown condition is released.     Short-Circuit Protection  A transient short-circuit occurs, due to the limited  bandwidth of the current limit amplifier, which cannot  respond quickly to this event. The SGM2521/1A/2/2A  family contains a fast-trip comparator with a threshold  (IFAST-TRIP). If IOUT > IFAST-TRIP, the comparator turns off  the N-MOSFET and terminates the short-circuit peak  current across the N-MOSFET rapidly. The fast-trip  threshold is 1.8 times the overload current limit. The  fast-trip comparator can terminate the transient  short-circuit peak current, and then the current limit  function limits the output current to ILIMIT.    See Equation 8 for the calculation.  IFAST-TRIP = 1.8 × ILIMIT              (8)  The IFAST-TRIP is fast-trip current limit.  After turning off internal power N-MOSFET for some  microseconds, the device restarts to power on. The  same applies to short-circuit power on condition, input  current will be limited to ILIMIT point.   When the switching voltage of SGM2521/1A/2/2A is  more than 15V, customer should add a no more than  27V (> 0.5W) Zener diode to prevent the input voltage  spike from damaging the SGM2521/1A/2/2A (as shown  in Figure 3).     Startup with Output Shorted  For short-circuit power on conditions, input current will  be limited to ILIMIT point.    Thermal Foldback   1% to 20% current derating effectively reduces thermal  dissipation and improves PCB layout flexibility.        Figure 6.

When any  of over-voltage, under-voltage, thermal shutdown or  short-circuit occurs, the nFLT pin is pulled low. The  nFLT pin is open-drain output which can be connected  to OUT or another external voltage through an external  pull-up resistor. If not used, leave it floating or connect  to GND.    IN, OUT and GND Pins  To limit the voltage drop on the input supply caused by  transient inrush current when the switch turns on into a  fully discharged load capacitor, a capacitor needs to be  placed between IN and GND pins. Use a bypass  capacitor as close as possible between IN and GND  pins. In the on-state condition, VOUT can be calculated  using the Equation 9.  VOUT = VIN - (RDSON × IOUT)           (9)  where RDSON is the on-resistance of the internal FET.  GND is the lowest potential of the circuit, unless  otherwise noted.    Thermal Shutdown (TSD)  Thermal shutdown protects the device from excessive  temperature. Once the device is shut down due to TSD  fault,  it  would  either  stay  latch-off  (SGM2522/SGM2522A) or restart automatically after TJ  drops below [TSD - 20℃] (SGM2521/SGM2521A).    Shutdown Control  The device has a built-in over-temperature shutdown  circuitry designed to protect the internal N-MOSFETs if  the junction temperature exceeds TSD. The internal  N-MOSFET can be remotely turned off by taking the  ENUV pin below its 0.53V threshold as shown in Figure 7.  Upon releasing the ENUV pin, the device turns on with  soft-start cycle.

The wide operating voltage range (4.5V to 24V) is  specifically designed for many popular DC buses, and  the maximum load current of 2A can meet the power  delivery requirements of many devices.    Protection and Current Limit for AC/DC  Power Supplies  In many small household appliances, portable devices,  consumer products and other application scenarios, the  primary-side power supplies and adapter are dominant.  These power supplies generally have a rated power of  5W - 30W, which is generally characterized by high  efficiency, low cost and few components. However,  there are also the following shortcomings:   • No secondary-side protection which can stop short-  circuit and other key faults immediately.   • Cannot provide precision current limit for overload  transients.   • Poor ability to regulate the output voltage during  sudden fluctuation of the AC input voltage, when the  output over-voltage condition is triggered.   Therefore, accurate current sensing and overload  protection are required for the secondary side output  port in the above applications. This requires the use of  precision operational amplifiers for additional circuit  implementation. It adds complexity to the solution and  leads to a loss of sensing. The SGM2521/1A/2/2A  adopting N-MOSFET with low on-resistance is a simple  and efficient solution. The typical application circuit of  SGM2521/1A/2/2A is shown in Figure 8.  During short-circuit fault, the internal fast comparator  shuts down the FET within 3μs (TYP) after the input  current increases rapidly and exceeds IFAST-TRIP which is  set by the external RILIM resistor.   Furthermore, the SGM2521/1A/2/2A family provides  inrush current limit during the output ramp-up  procedure.

IS requires that the total energy available during  equipment operation is not enough to ignite the  surrounding explosive environment by means of  electric sparks or heat transfer. This requires precision  current limits to ensure that the set current limits are not  exceeded over a wide operating temperature range and  variable environmental conditions. Applications such as  gas analyzers, medical devices, portal industrial  equipment, etc., need to meet these importance safety  standards. As a simple over-voltage and over-load  protection solution, the SGM2521/1A/2/2A family is  applicable to each power rail inside the system  application. The typical implementation circuit of  SGM2521/1A/2/2A is shown in Figure 9.    Smart Load Switch  The smart load switch is a series of MOSFETs used to  switch the load (resistance or capacitance). It also  provides protection in case of failure. Figure 10 shows  a typical discrete implementation of load switch, which  requires more components and more complex circuits  to achieve fault protection. The SGM2521/1A/2/2A can  be used as a load switch for the applications whose  operating range is from 4.5V to 24V.
