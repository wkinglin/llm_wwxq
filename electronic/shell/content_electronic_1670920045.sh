The SGM8632C features a 3.5mV maximum input  offset voltage. The minimum input common mode  voltage is within 0.1V below the negative rail, and the  output swing is rail-to-rail with heavy loads. It exhibits a  high gain-bandwidth product of 6MHz and a slew rate  of 3.7V/μs. These specifications make the operational  amplifier appropriate for various applications.  The SGM8632C is available in a Green MSOP-8  package. It is specified over the extended industrial  temperature range (-40℃ to +125℃).  "}'

In Figure 1, the ESD  diodes between the inputs and the power supply rails  will clamp the input voltage not to exceed the rails.        Figure 1. Input Equivalent Circuit    Rail-to-Rail Output  The SGM8632C supports rail-to-rail output operation.  In single power supply application, for example, when  +VS = 5V, -VS = GND, 10kΩ load resistor is tied from  OUT pin to ground, the typical output swing range is  from 0.007V to 4.993V.    Driving Capacitive Loads  The SGM8632C is designed for unity-gain stable for  capacitive load up to 1000pF. If greater capacitive load  must be driven in application, the circuit in Figure 2 can  be used. In this circuit, the IR drop voltage generated  by RISO is compensated by feedback loop.        Figure 2. Circuit to Drive Heavy Capacitive Load    Power Supply Decoupling and Layout  A clean and low noise power supply is very important in  amplifier circuit design, besides of input signal noise,  the power supply is one of important source of noise to  the amplifier through +VS and -VS pins. Power supply  bypassing is an effective method to clear up the noise  at power supply, and the low impedance path to ground  of decoupling capacitor will bypass the noise to GND.  In application, 10μF ceramic capacitor paralleled with  0.1μF or 0.01μF ceramic capacitor is used in Figure 3.  The ceramic capacitors should be placed as close as  possible to +VS and -VS power supply pins.         Figure 3. Amplifier Power Supply Bypassing    Grounding  In low speed application, one node grounding technique  is the simplest and most effective method to eliminate  the noise generated by grounding. In high speed  application, the general method to eliminate noise is to  use a complete ground plane technique, and the whole  ground plane will help distribute heat and reduce EMI  noise pickup.    Reduce Input-to-Output Coupling  To reduce the input-to-output coupling, the input traces  must be placed as far away from the power supply or  output traces as possible. The sensitive trace must not  be placed in parallel with the noisy trace in same layer.  They must be placed perpendicularly in different layers  to reduce the crosstalk. These PCB layout techniques  will help to reduce unwanted positive feedback and  noise.

In this  design, the filter bandwidth must be less than the  bandwidth of the amplifier, the resistor values must be  selected as low as possible to reduce ringing or  oscillation generated by the parasitic parameters in  PCB layout.
