This high frequency device does not need  external compensation and is a perfect solution for  compact designs. The 2.5V to 5.5V input voltage range  is suitable for almost all available battery chemistries.  For the SGM61040A version, to keep the high  efficiency in the whole load range, the device operates  in pulse width modulation (PWM) mode at normal load  and automatically enters the power-save mode (PSM)  at light loads. For the SGM61040B version, the device  operates in continuous current mode (CCM) at light and  heavy loads.  This device is based on adaptive off-time architecture,  but still allows a wide range of output capacitors up to  150μF and even more. This flexibility makes the device a  good choice for system power rails supplies. The  adaptive off-time architecture provides excellent output  voltage accuracy and superb load transient response.  The SGM61040 is available in a Green TDFN-2×2-7L  package.  "}'

It operates at a quasi-fixed frequency of  2.5MHz (SGM61040B 2MHz) and uses adaptive  off-time PWM control for the moderate to heavy load  range. This allows using a small inductor and small  capacitors for compact designs. At light load condition,  the SGM61040A operates in power-save mode to  reduce the switching frequency and losses for longer  battery life. The power-save mode quiescent current is  42μA (TYP) while the shutdown current is only 0.06μA  (TYP). For the SGM61040B, it operates in continuous  current mode from no load to heavy loads.  Under-Voltage Lockout (UVLO)  Operating with insufficient supply voltage can cause  device malfunction or failure. The UVLO protection  shuts down the device if the input voltage is below the  VUVLO threshold. The UVLO comparator has a 210mV  hysteresis band.  Device Enable and Disable  When the input voltage is valid, pulling the EN input to  logic high will enable the device, and pulling it to logic  low will shut it down. In the shutdown mode, the  switches and all control circuits are turned off to reduce  the device current to 0.06μA (TYP). A 550kΩ pull-down  resistor is internally placed between EN and GND pins  when the device is disabled.  During shutdown, an internal 43Ω resistor is connected  between SW and GND pins and softly discharges the  output capacitors. This discharge function is also  activated when the shutdown is caused by a thermal  shutdown, UVLO, or short-circuit protection.  Power Good Output (PG)  The PG pin is an open-drain output with 1mA sinking  capability. This pin should be pulled up with an external  resistor to a logic high rail no more than 5.5V unless it  is not used. The PG signal is in high-impedance state  when the output voltage is in regulation range. PG  remains low until VOUT exceeds 95% of its nominal (set)  value and goes low if VOUT drops below 90% of its  nominal value. Table 1 shows how the PG state is  changed in different conditions. VPG is the threshold of  the PG hysteretic comparator. It has a 5% hysteresis  band and goes high when VFB rises above 95% of the VREF.  The PG output is useful for power supply sequencing  as well. Usually, the multiple power rails of a system  need to be powered in a specific sequence for proper  startup. The PG output of the leading power supply is  connected to the EN input of the subsequent power  supply to implement such sequencing.   Table 1. PG Output State in Different Conditions  Reason  Condition(s)  PG State  High-Z  Low  Output Voltage  EN = High, VFB ≥ VPG  √    EN = High, VFB ≤ VPG    √  Shutdown by EN  EN = Low    √  Thermal Shutdown  TJ > TJSD    √  UVLO  0.6V < VIN < VUVLO    √  Power Supply Removal  VIN ≤ 0.6V  √      Soft-Start and Pre-biased Output  An 800μs internal soft-start circuit is designed to  prevent input inrush current and voltage drops during  startup. This circuit slowly ramps up the error amplifier  reference voltage (VREF = 0.6V) after exiting the  shutdown state or under-voltage lockout (UVLO). Slow  increase of the output voltage prevents the excessive  inrush current for charging the output capacitors and  creates a smooth output voltage rise. The other  advantage of a soft-start is avoiding supply voltage  drops especially on the high internal impedance  sources such as the primary cells and rechargeable  batteries.   The SGM61040 is also capable of starting with a  pre-biased output capacitor when it is powered up or  enabled. When the device is turning on, a bias on the  output may exist due to the other sources connected to  the load(s) such as multi-voltage ICs or simply because  of residual charges on the output capacitors. For  example, when a device with light load is disabled and  re-enabled, the output may not drop during the off  period and the device must restart under pre-biased  output condition. Without the pre-biased capability, the  device may not be able to start up properly. The output  ramp is automatically initiated with the bias voltage and  ramps up to the nominal output value.         4A High Efficiency  SGM61040  Synchronous Buck Converter      13  NOVEMBER 2022  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued)  Power-Save Mode (SGM61040A)  At light load conditions, the SGM61040A shifts to the  power-save mode to reduce the switching frequency  and minimize the losses. It also shuts down most of the  internal circuits in power-save mode. In this mode, one  or more PWM pulses are sent to charge the output  capacitor and then the switches are kept off. The output  capacitor voltage gradually drops due to small load  current and when it falls below the nominal voltage  threshold, the PWM pulses resume. If the load is still  low, the output will go slightly higher than normal value  again and the switches will be turned off. In power-save  mode, the output voltage is slightly higher than nominal  output voltage. This effect can be mitigated by a larger  output capacitor.  Continuous Conduction Mode (SGM61040B)  In continuous conduction mode (CCM), the frequency  is fixed and the output voltage ripple will be minimal.  The maximum output current of 4A is supplied in CCM.  Low Dropout Operation (100% Duty Cycle)  When the input voltage reduces, the on-time increases.  When the input voltage is lower than the regulation  output voltage, the output voltage drops, and the  SGM61040 goes into 100% duty cycle mode. The  high-side switch is always turned on, and the output  voltage is determined by the load current times the  RDSON composed by the high-side switch and inductor.  Current Limit and Hiccup Mode  Short-Circuit Protection  Limiting the switch current protects the switch itself and  also prevents over-current in the source and the  inductor. If the high-side (HS) switch current exceeds  the ILIM threshold, HS switch is turned off and the  low-side (LS) switch will be turned on to reduce the  inductor current and limit the peak.  If 2ms consecutive repetition of this event occurs, the  controller will stop switching and turns the output  discharge circuit on. Then a new startup will be  automatically initiated (hiccup) after 2.5ms (TYP). The  hiccup repeats until the overload or short-circuit fault is  cleared.  Thermal Shutdown  Thermal protection is designed to protect the die  against  overheating  damage.  If  the  junction  temperature exceeds TJSD threshold, the switching  stops and the device shuts down. Automatic recovery  with a soft-start will begin when the junction  temperature drops below the 135℃ falling threshold.       4A High Efficiency  SGM61040  Synchronous Buck Converter      14  NOVEMBER 2022  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  "}'

Place  this capacitor right beside the VIN and GND pins. A  10μF ceramic capacitor with X5R or better dielectric  and 0805 or smaller size is sufficient in most cases. A  larger value can be selected to reduce the input current  ripple.  Inductor Selection (L)  The important factors for inductor selection are  inductance (L), saturation current (ISAT), RMS rating  (IRMS), DC resistance (DCR) and dimensions. Use  Equation 1 to find the inductor peak current (IL_MAX) and  peak-to-peak ripple current (∆IL) in static conditions:  = + − = × × L L_MAX O_MAX L OUT SW ΔI I I 2 1 D ΔI V L f             (1)   IO_MAX is the maximum load current, D = VOUT/VIN represents  duty cycle and fSW is the switching frequency.  ISAT should be higher than IL_MAX, and sufficient margin  should be reserved. Typically, the saturation current  above high-side current limit is enough, and a 10% to  30% ripple current is selected to calculate the  inductance. Larger inductance values reduce the ripple  current but lead to sluggish transient response.  Output Capacitor Selection (COUT)  This device is capable to operate with low ESR ceramic  capacitors to get low voltage ripple and fast response. 3 × 22μF  capacitors with X7R or X5R dielectric type are  recommended. If an output capacitor larger than 150μF  is used, appropriate startup current reduction should be  considered to avoid current limiting or false triggering of  the short-circuit protection during startup.       4A High Efficiency  SGM61040  Synchronous Buck Converter      15  NOVEMBER 2022  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued)  Output Voltage Setting  Use Equation 2 to select the R1/R2 resistor divider to  set the VOUT.

The  inductor initial tolerance can be as high as -30% to +20%  of the nominal value and proper current derating is  usually required. Bias voltage may cause significant  capacitance drops in the ceramic capacitors. The  effective deviation of a ceramic capacitor can be as  high as -50% to +20% of the nominal value.   L1 = 0.47µH, COUT = 3 × 22µF and C3 = 6pF are the  recommended values for the typical application.   Table 4.

Follow the guidelines  below for designing a good layout for the SGM61040.  • Place the input capacitor close to the device with the shortest possible connection traces.   • Share the same GND return point for the input and output capacitors and locate it as close as possible to the  device GND pin to minimize the AC current loops. Place the inductor close to the switching node and connect it  with a short trace to minimize the parasitic capacitances coupled to the SW node.  • Keep the signal traces like the FB sense line away from SW or other noisy sources.  • Use GND planes in mid-layers for shielding and minimizing the ground potential drifts.
