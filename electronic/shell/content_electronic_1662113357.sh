The device can operate with a wide input  voltage from 1.15V to 5.2V. The 1.7μA (TYP) quiescent  current and light load power-save mode further improve  the system efficiency. The device employs peak current  mode control with 1.3A (TYP) peak switch current limit.  The SGM66099B is capable of disconnecting the output  from input when the device is disabled to avoid  unnecessary current consumption. The integrated down  mode and pass-through mode ensure a smooth  operation when input voltage is close to or higher than  the set output voltage. The device can operate both in  the adjustable output voltage version and fixed output  voltage version.    Start-up and Enable  Logic high on EN pin enables the SGM66099B, while a  logic low disables the device. During logic low state, the  device stops operation, and the output voltage is  completely disconnected from the input voltage. During  logic low state, the shutdown current is less than 1μA.  The SGM66099B is able to start up from 1.15V input  voltage with larger than 3kΩ load. Before the output  voltage reaches 2.2V during the start-up phase, the  switch current is limited to about 200mA. Therefore, if  the load during start-up is too heavy, the device will fail  to charge the output voltage to above 2.2V after  soft-start time expires, and it will not be able to start up  successfully.    Over-Current and Short Circuit Protection  The SGM66099B implements cycle-by-cycle current  limit during an over-current event. When the current limit  threshold (ILIM) is reached, the low-side power MOSFET  is turned off to prevent the inductor current from further  increase. During over-current event, the output voltage  will drop until a constant power state is reached  between input and output. If the current limit causes the  output to drop below the input voltage, the SGM66099B  enters down mode, where the peak current is still  limited by ILIM cycle-by-cycle. If the output continues  dropping below 2.2V, the device enters start-up  process again.    The SGM66099B may not be shut down by pulling the  EN to logic low when the supply voltage is below 0.85V,  while the supply voltage can drop to as low as 0.3V for  maintain the output voltage with light loadings.    During the output short-to-ground case, as output  voltage declines below 2.2V, the SGM66099B reduces  the current limit to about 200mA to reduce power  dissipation within the device. As the short circuit  condition is removed, the device resumes operation  and goes through a soft-start sequence to regulate the  set output voltage.    Over-Voltage Protection  SGM66099B integrates over-voltage protection (OVP)  to protect the device in the event of feedback resistor  short-to-ground or incorrect feedback resistor value  being populated. The SGM66099B stops switching  when the OVP threshold of 5.7V (TYP) is reached. The  device implements 100mV OVP hysteresis. When the  output voltage is 100mV lower than the OVP threshold,  the device resumes switching.    Power-Save Mode under Light Load  Condition  The SGM66099B enters into power-save mode under  light load condition.    Down Mode and Pass-Through Mode  SGM66099B offers down mode feature where the  device can still regulate the set output voltage even  when the input voltage is higher than output voltage. If  the input voltage continues increasing in down mode,  the device automatically enters pass-through mode.  Care should be taken in pass-through mode, where the  input voltage should not exceed the recommended  maximum input voltage.  In down mode, the control logic pulls the gate of PMOS  to the input voltage rather than ground. This method  allows effective control of inductor current when VIN >  VOUT. Thermal consideration should be taken in down  mode, where the voltage drop on the PMOS increases  as the delta of VIN and VOUT increases.   In pass-through mode, the complimentary switching  action stops. The gate of PMOS is pulled to ground for  always-on and the low-side switch remains off. The  output voltage is equal to the input voltage minus the  voltage drop across the DC resistance (DCR) of the  inductor and the on-resistance of the rectified PMOS.       Synchronous Boost Converter  SGM66099B  with Ultra-Low Quiescent Current      10  AUGUST 2022  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued)  SGM66099B enters down mode when the input voltage  is equal to or higher than VOUT - 100mV. It remains in  down mode until the VIN is more than VOUT + 0.3V and  then automatically enters pass-through mode. In  pass-through mode, the high-side PMOS is always  turned on to pass the input voltage to the output. As VIN  drops below 1% above the target output voltage, the  device exits pass-through mode and returns to down  mode.

The selection of  external component values for the SGM66099B-ADJ  can reference the following design procedure.  Table 1. Design Requirements  PARAMETERS  VALUES  Input Voltage  2.7V ~ 4.2V  Output Voltage  5V  Output Current  1mA  Output Voltage Ripple  ±50mV    Programming the Output Voltage  External resistor dividers R1 and R2 (see Figure 4) can  be used to set the output voltage. The typical voltage at  the FB pin is VREF of 1.0V.  × 1 2 OUT REF 2 R  + R V  = V R               (1)  The leakage current into the FB pin affects the  accuracy of output voltage. To minimize the leakage  current effect, the current flowing through R2 should be  100 times greater than FB pin leakage current. Small  R2 increases the noise immunity, while large R2  reduces the leakage current flowing through feedback  resistors, which improves the no load efficiency of the  device. 1MΩ and 249kΩ resistors are selected for R1  and R2 respectively in this case. ±1% accuracy  resistors are recommended for R1 and R2 to improve  output voltage accuracy.  An external feed-forward capacitor (CFWD) from 10pF to  22pF in parallel with R1 is recommended to improve  device’s stability.  For fixed output voltage version, connect the FB pin to  GND and do not leave FB pin floating.    Maximum Output Current  The maximum output load capability of SGM66099B  depends on the minimum desired operation input  voltage and the current limit of the device. The  maximum load current can be estimated by Equation 2,  LH IN LIM OUT(MAX) OUT I V (I  -  ) η 2 I  =  V ⋅ ⋅           (2)  where η is the conversion efficiency, using 85% for  estimation, ILH is the inductor peak-to-peak ripple  current and ILIM is the switch current limit.  For worst-case condition analysis, the minimum input  voltage, maximum Boost output voltage and minimum  current limit (ILIM) should be used.    Inductor Selection  Inductor selection is one of the most important  criterions for switch mode power supply, because the  inductor selection may affect the power supply’s  transient response, loop stability, efficiency and  steady-state operation. Inductor parameters of DC  resistance (DCR), inductance and saturation current  are critical for a smooth and efficient power supply  operation.    The internal compensation of the device is optimized  with 1μH and 2.2μH. When VOUT is higher than 3V,  2.2μH inductance should be selected. When VOUT is  less than 3V, 1.1μH inductance should be selected.

A 10μF, low  ESR and X5R or higher temperature coefficient  ceramic capacitor is recommended to place as close to  the VIN and GND pins as possible to improve transient  response and EMI behavior.  Boost converter’s output capacitor plays a significant  role in ensuring good system performance. The  location of output capacitor will have an effect on the  switching spikes on the SW pin, which ultimately affects  EMI performance and potentially damages the IC due  to large switching spikes. The current loop formed by  the output capacitor flowing from the VOUT pin and  back to the GND pin should be as small as possible.  Therefore, a ceramic cap should be placed as close to  the VOUT and GND pins of the IC as possible.   Boost topology presents right-half-plane-zero which is  dictated by inductance. In addition, the output capacitor  sets the corner frequency of the converter for current  mode controlled method. Therefore, for a larger  inductor, a larger output capacitor must be used. The  device’s internal compensation is optimized to operate  with inductance values between 1μH and 2.2μH,  resulting in the minimum output capacitor value of 20μF  (nominal value). Increasing the output capacitor can  reduce output ripple in PWM mode.  Due to the nature of ceramic capacitors’ DC bias effect,  effective capacitance at the bias voltage should be  verified. GRM188R60J106ME84D, a 10μF ceramic  capacitor, is used for VOUT rail. It has high effective  capacitance value under DC biased condition.  In the case of load hot-plugging, the input capacitance  of load device needs to be less than 1/10 of the output  capacitance of SGM66099B.    Layout  In addition to component selection, layout is a critical  step to ensure the performance of any switch mode  power supplies. Poor layout could result in system  instability, EMI failure, and device damage. Thus, place  the inductor, input and output capacitors as close to the  IC as possible, and use wide and short traces for  current carrying traces to minimize PCB inductance.  For Boost converter, the current loop of the output  capacitor from VOUT pin back to the GND pin of the  device should be as small as possible.
