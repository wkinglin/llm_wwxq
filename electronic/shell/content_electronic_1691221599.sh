The quiescent  current is 320μA (TYP) and the shutdown supply  current is 2μA (TYP). Two MOSFETs with low RDSON are  integrated to improve the efficiency. Efficiency is  maximized through power-save mode (PSM) at light  load. The SGM61233A has a wide selectable switching  frequency (50kHz to 1500kHz) to allow desired tradeoff  between  efficiency  and  component  sizes.  The  SGM61233B has adjustable soft-start time for flexible  application. The SGM61233C has a fixed 340kHz  switching frequency and a fixed internal 2ms soft-start  time.  The UVLO level can be adjusted (increased) by an  external resistor divider. Secure operation in overload  conditions is ensured by cycle-by-cycle current limit,  hiccup protection and thermal shutdown protection.  The low-side MOSFET has sinking current limit to  prevent excessive reverse current.  The SGM61233 is offered in the Green SOIC-8  (Exposed Pad) and TDFN-3×3-10L packages.  "}'

Using peak current mode  control provides the device good line and load transient  responses with reduced output capacitance and simple  compensation.  The minimum operating input voltage of the device is  4.5V. The output voltage can be set down to 0.8V  (reference voltage). Typical no switching operating  current is 320μA. The shutdown current is 2μA if the  device is disabled. High efficiency is achieved through  the integrated low RDSON high-side switch (118mΩ) and  low-side switch (81mΩ).  The EN pin is internally pulled up by a current source  that can keep the device enable if EN pin is floating. It  can also be used to increase the input UVLO threshold  with a resistor divider.  The bootstrap diode is integrated and only a small  capacitor (CBOOT) between BOOT and PH pins is  needed for the high-side MOSFET gate driving bias. A  separate UVLO circuit monitors CBOOT voltage and  turns off the high-side switch if CBOOT voltage falls  below a preset threshold.  Additional features such as thermal shutdown,  over-voltage protection, and short-circuit protection  (hiccup mode) are also provided.  The SGM61233A has adjustable switching frequency  from 50kHz to 1500kHz and a fixed internal 2ms  soft-start time.  The SGM61233B has an internal current source on the  SS pin that allows soft-start time to be adjusted with a  small external capacitor. The device has a fixed  340kHz switching frequency.  The SGM61233C has a fixed 340kHz switching  frequency and a fixed internal 2ms soft-start time.    Minimum Input Voltage (4.5V) and UVLO  The recommended minimum operating input voltage is  4.5V. It may operate with lower input voltages that are  above the VIN rising UVLO threshold (4.2V TYP). The  VIN UVLO threshold has a hysteresis of 270mV (TYP).  If VIN falls below the falling UVLO voltage, the device  will stop switching. If the EN pin is left floating or pulled  high and VIN exceeds the rising UVLO threshold, the  device will start up with a soft-start.    Enable Input and UVLO Adjustment  The EN pin is able to control the device on or off. An  internal pull-up current source keeps the EN pin voltage  at high state by default. The EN pin can be pulled up to  a voltage above its rising threshold or left floating to  enable the device. The device will be disabled if the EN  voltage is pulled externally below the falling threshold  voltage.  If an application requires increasing the VIN turn-on  threshold and adding hysteresis to the VIN UVLO, a  voltage divider as shown in Figure 3 is required. When  EN voltage exceeds VENH = 1.2V (TYP), an additional  3.7μA current is injected to the divider to provide  hysteresis and it will be removed when EN pin voltage  is below VENL = 1.13V (TYP). Use Equation 1 and 2 to  calculate these resistors. VSTART is the input start  (turn-on) threshold voltage and VSTOP is the input stop  (turn-off) threshold voltage.

A ceramic  capacitor with X5R or better grade dielectric is  recommended. The capacitor must have a 10V or  higher voltage rating. When the voltage across the  BOOT capacitor falls below the BOOT-PH UVLO  (3.25V TYP), the high-side switch is turned off, and the  low-side switch is turned on to recharge the BOOT  capacitor.    RT Pin and Switching Frequency  Adjustment (SGM61233A Only)  Several parameters such as losses, inductor and  capacitors sizes and response time are considered in  selection of the switching frequency. Higher frequency  increases the switching and gate charge losses, and  lower frequency requires larger inductance and  capacitance, which can lead to larger overall physical  size and higher costs. Therefore, a tradeoff is needed  between losses and component size. If the application  is noise-sensitive to a frequency range, the frequency  should be selected out of that range.  The switching frequency of the SGM61233A can be set  between 50kHz to 1500kHz using a resistor (RT) placed  between RT and AGND pins. Equation 3 can be used  to determine RT for a given switching frequency.   1.025 T SW R  (kΩ) = 55300 f (kHz) − ×             (3)    SS Pin and Soft-Start Adjustment  (SGM61233B Only)  The SGM61233B has an external soft-start (SS) pin for  adjustable startup time. It is recommended to add a  soft-start capacitor (CSS) between SS pin and AGND to  set the soft-start time. The lower of the SS pin voltage  VSS and VREF is applied to the error amplifier to regulate  the output. The internal ISS = 2.4μA (TYP) current  charges CSS and provides a linear voltage ramp on the  SS pin. Use Equation 4 to calculate the soft-start time.  × SS REF SS SS C  (nF) V  (V) t  (ms) =  I  (μA)             (4)    Error Amplifier (EA)  This device uses a transconductance amplifier as an  error amplifier (EA) to compare the sensed output  voltage (VSENSE) with the internal reference. The gain of  EA amplifier in normal operation is 1300μA/V (TYP).  The output current is injected into the frequency  compensation network (between COMP and GND pins)  to produce the control signal (VC) for the PWM  comparator.    Slope Compensation  Without implementing some slope compensation, the  PWM pulse widths will be unstable and oscillatory at  duty cycles above 50%. To avoid sub-harmonic  oscillations in this device, an internal compensation  ramp is added to the measured switch current before  comparing it with the control signal by the PWM  comparator.    Power-Save Mode  To increase light load efficiency, power-save mode  (PSM) feature is included in the SGM61233. When the  COMP pin voltage (VC) is lower than 0.545V (TYP), the  device will enter power-save mode. In this mode, the  MOSFET switching is inhibited when VC falls below  0.545V. The device will exit PSM if VC rises above  0.545V.    Over-Current Protection  Over-current protection (OCP) is naturally provided by  current mode control. In each cycle, the high-side (HS)  current sensing starts a short time (blanking time) after  the HS switch is turned on. The sensed HS switch  current is continuously compared with the HS current  limit threshold and when the HS current reaches to that  threshold, the HS switch is turned off.  While the low-side (LS) switch is turned on, the  conduction current is monitored by the internal circuitry.  In each cycle, the sensed LS switch current is  compared to the internally LS current limit threshold  only when the HS current limit threshold is triggered. If  the sensed LS switch current is higher than the LS  current limit threshold during LS conduction, the HS  does not turn on and the LS stays on when the clock  signal comes. When the sensed LS switch current is  below the LS current limit threshold, the HS switch  turns on again at the next clock.  In addition, if an output overload condition occurs for  more than 512 switching cycles, then the device shuts  down and restarts after 16384 cycles.        4.5V to 28V Input, 3A Output,  SGM61233  Synchronous Buck Converter      JULY 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued)  Over-Voltage Protection  When an overload or an output fault condition is  removed, large overshoot may occur on the output. The  SGM61233 includes a protection circuit to reduce such  over-voltage transients. If the voltage at the VSENSE  pin exceeds 109% of the VREF threshold, the high-side  switch is turned off. When it returns below 106% of the  VREF, the high-side switch is allowed to turn on again.  Thermal Shutdown (TSD)  If the junction temperature (TJ) exceeds +175℃ (TYP),  the TSD protection circuit will stop the switch from  operating to protect the device from overheating. When  the junction temperature drops below +165°C (TYP),  the device will automatically restart after the built-in  thermal shutdown hiccup time and executes the  power-up procedure.       4.5V to 28V Input, 3A Output,  SGM61233  Synchronous Buck Converter      JULY 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  "}'

At least 3μF of effective capacitance  (after derating) is needed at the input. In some  applications, additional bulk capacitance may also be  required for the input, for example, when the  SGM61233 is more than 5cm away from the input  source. The input capacitor ripple current rating must  also be greater than the maximum input current ripple.  The input current ripple can be calculated using  Equation 5 and the maximum value occurs at 50% duty  cycle. Using the design example values, IOUT = 3A,  yields an RMS input ripple current of 1.5A.

The ratio of  inductor current ripple (∆IL) to the maximum output  current (IOUT) is represented as KIND factor (KIND =  ∆IL/IOUT). The inductor ripple current is bypassed and  filtered by the output capacitor and the inductor DC  current is passed to the output. Inductor ripple is  selected based on a few considerations. The peak  inductor current (IOUT + ∆IL/2) must have a safe margin  from the saturation current of the inductor in the  worst-case  conditions.  For  peak  current  mode  converter, selecting an inductor with saturation current  must be above the switch current limit. Typically, a 20%  to 40% current ripple is selected (KIND = 0.2 ~ 0.4).   − × × × IN_MAX OUT OUT OUT IND IN_MAX SW V V V L =  I K V f          (7)  In this example, the calculated inductance will be  13.4μH with KIND = 0.3, so the nearest larger  inductance of 15μH is selected.

The selected value must satisfy all of them. The desired  transient response is usually expressed as maximum  overshoot,  maximum  undershoot,  or  maximum  recovery time of VOUT in response to a large load step.  Transient response is usually the more stringent criteria  in low output voltage applications. The output capacitor  must provide the increased load current or absorb the  excess inductor current until the control loop can  re-adjust the current of the inductor to the new load  level. Typically, it requires two or more cycles for the  loop to detect and respond to the output change.  Another requirement may also be expressed as desired  hold-up time in which the output capacitor must hold  the output voltage above a certain level for a specified  period if the input power is removed. It may also be  expressed as the maximum output voltage drop or rise  when the full load is connected or disconnected (100%  load step). Equation 11 can be used to calculate the  minimum output capacitance that is needed to supply a  current step (ΔIOUT) for at least 2 cycles until the control  loop responds to the load change with a maximum  allowed output transient of ΔVOUT (overshoot or  undershoot).  × ∆ × ∆ OUT OUT SW OUT 2 I C >   f V                    (11)  where:  • ΔIOUT is the change in output current.  • ΔVOUT is the allowable change in the output voltage.  For example, if the acceptable transient from 1.5A to  3A load step is 5%, by inserting ΔVOUT = 0.05 × 5V =  0.25V and ΔIOUT = 1.5A, the minimum required  capacitance will be 35.3μF. Note that the impact of  output capacitor ESR on the transient is not considered  in Equation 11. For ceramic capacitors, the ESR is  generally small enough to ignore its impact on the  calculation of ΔVOUT transient.  The output capacitor must also be sized to absorb  energy stored in the inductor when transitioning from a  high to low load current. The energy stored in the  inductor can produce an output voltage overshoot when  the load current rapidly decreases. The excess energy  absorbed in the output capacitor increases the voltage  on the capacitor. The capacitor must be sized to  maintain the desired output voltage during these  transient periods.

Equation 13 can be used for the output ripple criteria  and finding the minimum output capacitance needed.  VOUT_RIPPLE is the maximum acceptable ripple. In this  example, the allowed ripple is 50mV that results in  minimum capacitance of 6.6μF.  ∆ × × L OUT SW OUT_RIPPLE I C >   8 f V             (13)  Note that the impact of output capacitor ESR on the  ripple is not considered in Equation 13.

In this example, a 2 × 47μF/10V X5R  ceramic capacitor with 3mΩ of ESR is used. The  amount of ripple current that a capacitor can handle  without damage or overheating is limited. The inductor  ripple is bypassed through the output capacitor.  Equation 15 calculates the RMS current that the output  capacitor must support.

It is recommended to add a resistor R4  in series with C4 to slow down switch-on speed of the  HS switch and improve radiated EMI problems. For  most applications, R4 is used around 5~10Ω. Too high  values for R4 may cause insufficient C4 charging in high  duty-cycle applications. Slower switch switch-on speed  will also increase switch losses and reduce efficiency.    UVLO Setting  The input UVLO can be programmed using an external  voltage divider on the EN pin of the SGM61233. In this  design, R1 is connected between VIN and the EN pins  and R2 is connected between EN and AGND pins (see  Figure 4). The UVLO has two thresholds (hysteresis),  one for power-up (turn-on) when the input voltage is  rising and one for power-down or brownout (turn-off)  when the voltage is falling. In this design, the turn-on  (enable to start switching) occurs when VIN rises above  7V (UVLO rising threshold). When the regulator is  working, it will not stop switching until the input falls  below 6V (UVLO falling threshold). Equations 1 and 2  are provided to calculate the resistors. For this example,  the nearest standard resistor values are R1 = 160kΩ  and R2 = 31.6kΩ.    Switching Frequency  In order to make the parameter design match the  internal  setting  frequency  of  SGM61233B  and  SGM61233C, the switching frequency of SGM61233A  is set to 340kHz and R7 = 140.6kΩ is calculated using  Equation 3. For this example, the nearest lager  standard resistor value is 143kΩ.    Feedback Resistors Setting  Use resistor dividers (R5 and R6) to set the output  voltage through Equation 16 and 17.  × − 5 REF 6 OUT REF R V R  = V V                   (16)    × +     5 OUT REF 6 R V  = V 1 R                (17)  It is recommended to choose R5 around 100kΩ and  calculate R6 from Equation 16. Use accurate and stable  resistors (1% or better) to enhance output accuracy.  For this example, the selected values are R5 = 100kΩ  and R6 = 19.1kΩ, resulting in a 4.988V output voltage.    Compensation Network Setting  Several techniques are used by engineers to  compensate a DC/DC regulator. The method presented  here uses simple calculations and generally results in  high phase margins.  COMP C3 R3 C7   Figure 5. SGM61233 Typical Application Circuit   4.5V to 28V Input, 3A Output,  SGM61233  Synchronous Buck Converter      JULY 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued)  One pole of the system is determined by the converter  (COUT and RLOAD), as given in Equation 18:  P1 OUT LOAD 1 f  = 2π C R × ×              (18)  where RLOAD is the load resistor and COUT is the output  capacitor.   The system has two zeros. One is generated by the  large ESR of COUT (ESRCOUT) and the other by the  compensator (C3 and R3), as given in Equation 19 and  Equation 20:  ESR OUT COUT 1 f  = 2π C ESR × ×          (19)  Z1 3 3 1 f  = 2π C R × ×                  (20)  If the ESR of the output capacitor is large, the effect of  this zero can be compensated by adding C7 to the  compensation network that places a third pole at:  P3 7 3 1 f  = 2π C R × ×                  (21)  The main goal of the compensation network is to adjust  the shape of the converter transfer function to get a  desired loop gain. The crossover frequency at which  the loop gain is 1 (0dB) is an important factor that  determines the bandwidth. Setting the crossover at a  frequency that too high will lead to system instability.  At the beginning of the design, the crossover frequency  is initially set to approximately 10% of the switching  frequency (0.1 × fSW), and then the following steps are  taken to design the compensation network with  sufficient phase margin.  1. Select R3 based on the desired crossover frequency  (fC):   OUT C OUT 3 m CS REF 2π C f V R  =  G G V × × × ×             (22)  where Gm is the error-amplifier transconductance (Gm =  1300μA/V)  and  GCS  is  the  current-sense  transconductance (GCS = 8A/V).  2. Select C3 to get sufficient phase margin. In the  applications using typical inductor values, placing the  compensation zero (fZ1) at fZ1 < 0.25 × fC would be  sufficient and C3 can be calculated as:  3 3 C 4 C  > 2π R f × ×                 (23)  3. Use C7 if the ESR zero is located below fSW/2. This  condition is valid if Equation 24 is true:  < × × SW OUT COUT f 1 2π C ESR 2            (24)  In this case, choose C7 from Equation 25 to set a pole  (fP3) over the ESR zero:  × = OUT COUT 7 3 C ESR C R                (25)       4.5V to 28V Input, 3A Output,  SGM61233  Synchronous Buck Converter      JULY 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  "}'

These layouts have been shown to bring  good results, although other layout designs may also  obtain good performance.  • Bypass the VIN pin to PGND pin with low-ESR  ceramic capacitors (10μF/X5R or better) and place  them as close as possible to the device.  • Share the same PGND connection point with the  input and output capacitors.  • Connect the device PGND to the PCB ground plane  right at the PGND pin.  • Minimize the length and the area of the connection  route from PH pin to the inductor to reduce the noise  coupling from this area.  • Consider sufficient ground plane area on the top side  for proper heat dissipation. Connect the large internal  or back-side ground planes to the top-side ground near  the device with thermal vias for better heat dissipation.    Layout Examples      Figure 6.
