The REF pin voltage is compared with  reference inside and is amplified. Also, the LM431BQ  responds fast if the operation current IKA is large  enough. In Figure 4, it is clear to see that the output  response with RSUP= 1kΩ is much faster than RSUP =  10kΩ. The maximum cathode current of IMIN is 0.7mA,  any cathode current below this value will cause a low  response (low open-loop gain) for the application of  comparator.  The overdrive voltage is defined as the voltage over the  internal reference voltage (2.5V). If the overdrive  voltage is not large enough, the output response will be  inaccurate and slow. On the contrary, the larger  overdrive voltage provided at the REF pin, the faster  the output response will be. Moreover, if the users  desire fast response, the overdrive voltage should be  larger than 10% of the internal voltage reference.  The input resistance should be less than 10kΩ in order to  minimize the voltage drop between VIN and VREF. The  readability of the logic output of the comparator should  be guaranteed so that it can be received by the next  stage. In Figure 4, the VIL of the comparator logic is 2V,  which is sufficient for a 5V supply voltage. However, for  the logic stage which is powered by 1.8V or 3.3V, the  VIL is hard to be figured out. To accommodate this, a  voltage divider should be taken into account. Due to the  Open-Collector (OC) output stage, the VIH is equal to  the voltage of its power supply. When the voltage  divider is used to attenuate VIH, please make sure that  the sum of R1 and R2 is greater than the resistance  RSUP to the power supply.  However, for this application, an external resistor RIN is  required to provide the IREF and guarantee the normal  operation of the LM431BQ. Also, because of the  voltage drop across RIN, so that the gap between VIN  and VREF is the voltage drop of RIN. To decrease the  error, the selected RIN should be small enough as the  maximum IREF is 2μA.    Figure 4.

The following  equation shows the relationship between VREF and VOUT.  In accurate applications, the error caused by IREF  should also be taken into account:       × ×     1 OUT REF REF 1 2 R V  = V    1 +   + I    R R   And the users need to ensure that the LM431BQ is fully  biased, so that this error can be decreased significantly  by the enough open-loop gain. This can be qualified by  satisfying the minimum cathode current IMIN in Electrical  Characteristics.  Total Accuracy  When the output voltage is set higher than unity gain  (2.5V), the behavior of the LM431BQ will be influenced  by the following possible errors:   The accuracy of both R1 and R2.   The internal reference voltage will be changed by the  temperature.   ΔVREF/ΔVKA: The change of internal reference voltage  will affect the output voltage.   |ZKA|: This impedance will be affected by the cathode  current.  The above possible errors are the worst cases for the  operation of the LM431BQ.  Stability  For traditional 431 devices, the reference output  stability is affected by output decoupling capacitor  which must be selected in a limited range in order to  keep 431 devices stable in applications. However, the  LM431BQ is different from the others. The LM431BQ  uses a special design to greatly improve output stability  when it drives capacitive load. From the curve of the  Cathode Current vs. Load Capacitance in Figure 6, the  output of the LM431BQ is stable in a wider range of  capacitive load. If the LM431BQ is used as a linear  regulator, a bigger decoupling capacitor can be used to  improve regulator's load transient or reduce the noise  of power supply. If the LM431BQ is used to replace the  others, the LM431BQ will be stable and there is no  need to change the output decoupling capacitor in the  original design.    Figure 6.

Figure 7. LM431BQ Start-Up Response    Power Supply Recommendations  When the LM431BQ is used as a shunt regulator, it is  necessary to use a bypass capacitor on the CATHODE  pin.  Limiting the current of the power supply is necessary  for the LM431BQ to operate within the maximum  cathode current. Also, the current of the REF pin should  be limited as well.  When the device shunts high current, adjusting the  width and length of traces on the CATHODE pin and  ANODE pin is necessary in the PCB board to have a  proper density of current.    Layout  Please make sure that the bypass capacitor is close  enough to the part. The width of trace on the PCB  should be fit for its amount of current flowing. For the  LM431BQ, these currents will not be large.                                "}'
