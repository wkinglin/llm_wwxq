The device  has a long timing delay to reset the system as required,  and enter the low-power mode after the timing delay ends.  It can not only avoid the reset caused by the button  closing or pressing for a short time, but also distinguish  hard system reset and software interruption.  The input pins of SGM851A/BC/BG are PB1 and PB2,  while the input pin of SGM851CG is PB1. The output pin  of all devices is an active-low, open-drain output (nRST).  For SGM851A, nRST goes low when both PB1 and PB2  remain low for the set timing delay, and nRST goes high  when either a PBx input goes high. For SGM851BC/BG,  nRST goes low when both PB1 and PB2 remain low for  the set timing delay, and nRST goes high after a fixed  time reset pulse. For SGM851CG, nRST goes low when  PB1 remain low for the set timing delay, and nRST goes  high after a fixed time reset pulse.  The nRST pin is an active-low, open-drain output and can  be wire-ORed with other open-drain devices. All devices  have the advantages of accurate reset, low supply current  and ultra-small size in applications.  The  SGM851  family  is  available  in  a  Green  UTDFN-1.45×1-6AL package. They specified over the  extended -40℃ to +125℃ temperature range.  "}'

See Table 1 for more details.  The SGM851A is a device with two input channels. The  output signal nRST resets to be low when both input  channels (PB1 and PB2) remain low for the duration of  push-button timer, and it becomes high if either input  (PBx) is released.  The SGM851BC/BG also has two input channels. The  output signal nRST resets to be low when both input  channels (PB1 and PB2) remain low for the duration of  push-button timer, and it becomes high after a preset  time-out duration.  The SGM851CG is a device with single input-channel.  The reset signal becomes activated (low level) when  the input signal remains low for the duration of  push-button timer, and it becomes high after a preset  time-out duration.  The SGM851 series has TS pins which are used to  adjust two different push-button timers of the device.  The different timers can be selected by connecting the  TS pin to VCC or to GND.    Feature Description  Push-Button Timer Selection (TS)  The push-button timer of SGM851 series has two  different options and can be selected by changing the  connection of TS pin to VCC or GND. The different  timings are shown in Table 2 below.  During the power-up of VCC, the state of the TS pin is  checked and confirmed. To avoid incorrect operation,  the connection of TS pin cannot be changed if both  input channels (PB1 and PB2) are detected as low. The  state of the TS pin can only be altered when either input  signal (PB1 or PB2) goes high or when VCC is  powered off.  Inputs  The two input channels (PB1 and PB2) of the  SGM851A are NMOS-based threshold inputs. And  when both inputs are detected as low for the duration of  the button timer (tTIMER), the output will be reset. For  each valid input condition as described previously, the  device sends the reset state only once. If either of the  two inputs goes high, the reset state is stopped and a  new reset pulse can be activated when a new input  condition occurs for tTIMER. The block diagram is shown  in Figure 5.  The SGM851BC/BG has two digital logic input  channels. And when both inputs are detected as low for  tTIMER, the output will be reset low and the reset-state  holds for a fixed reset pulse duration (tnRST). For each  valid input condition as described previously, the device  sends the reset state only once. Only if either of the two  inputs goes high, a new reset pulse can be activated  when a new input condition occurs for tTIMER. The block  diagram is shown in Figure 5.    Table 1.

The output resets only  one time when the input condition is met. The reset is  only triggered again when the input pin is released and  turns low again. The block diagram is shown in Figure  6.    Output (nRST)  The output of the SGM851 series is an open-drain  structure. The output needs a pull-up resistor to  maintain a high level when it is in a high-impedance  state (not in reset state). Through the pull-up resistor,  the output can be connected to another power rail  which is independent on the input rail of the device. The  output voltage can be pulled up to maximum 6.5V. The  value of the pull-up resistor should be correctly  determined to ensure the proper output voltage. The  resistor is dependent on the VOL, sink current capability,  and  the  leakage  current  of  the  output.  The  specifications of the resistors are shown in Electrical  Characteristics.  The Inputs (PB1, PB2) describes how the output is  asserted or deasserted. See Figure 2 (SGM851A),  Figure 3 (SGM851BC/BG), or Figure 4 (SGM851CG)  for a timing diagram that describes the relationship  between the PB1 and PB2 inputs and the output.  Figure 7 shows the timing diagram of SGM851BC/BG  output with the relationship of PB1 and PB2.  From the above diagram, if either input pulses change  (From low to high and then to low) during the reset  period of the output, the SGM851BC/BG is unable to  recognize this shift in pulses. If either PB1 or PB2 turns  high, the reset state is removed and the device can  detect a new cycle of valid input conditions as stated  previously.    Device Functional Modes  Normal Operation (VCC > 1.6V)  Once VCC is higher than 1.6V (VCC_MIN) for nearly 710μs  (tSD), the reset signal (nRST) responds to the status of  the input pins PBx and the device starts to work  normally. Details can be found in Table 1.    Below VCC_MIN (1.3V < VCC < 1.6V)  If VCC is below VCC_MIN but within the range of 1.3V to  1.6V, the output nRST works normally but the electrical  specifications in Electrical Characteristics and Timing  Requirements may not be met any more.    Power-On Reset (VCC < 1.3V)  When VCC is lower than 1.3V, the nRST pin ought to  turn into high-impedance state. However, this may not  be always satisfied under all conditions.      Figure 7.

To prevent  undesired resets due to short jitters of push-button, a  long timing delay is adopted to provide the reset signals  for the system. This method helps distinguish the user  input from the hardware resets. The SGM851 has an  open-drain output, with the input range of 1.6V to 6.5V  and the temperature range of -40℃ to +125℃.  If two inputs need to be monitored, the SGM851A and  SGM851BC/BG are preferred. However, for the cases  of only one input in need, the SGM851CG is more  suitable.    Typical Applications  Single Input with Fixed Reset Pulse Duration  It is suitable to use the SGM851CG when only one  input pin is desired to determine the state of the logic  pin (nRST). For example, the input pin PB1 of the  SGM851CG can be used to assert a load switch. Once  a reset signal is detected, the nRST is active low for a  fixed amount of time (tnRST) whatever the status of PB1  changes.  Figure 8 shows an application diagram for SGM851CG.  Please connect TS to VCC or ground to obtain different  PB time delays. Table 3 lists the design requirements  for Figure 8.

How to choose the pull-up  resistors needs to consider two aspects. The one is to  meet the falling time demands while the other is to  satisfy the sink current requirements to obtain a low  enough VOL for the application. For example, please  choose resistors from 1kΩ to 1MΩ under low-capacitive  load condition.    Dual Input Applications  It is suitable to choose SGM851A/BC/BG when two  pins of input are needed to determine the reset pin  status. To be more detailed, choose which device  depends on its actual function for the system. Choose  SGM851A if you need nRST to be always low unless  one of the PBx pin becomes high. Besides, you may  need to choose SGM851BC/BG if you want the nRST  pin holds low for a constant period without the influence  of the PBx pin.  Table 4 lists the design requirements for Figure 9.  Please connect TS to VCC or ground to obtain different  PB time delays. It can be used as a single channel if  users short the PB pin to ground.

For example, please choose resistors from  1kΩ to 1MΩ under low-capacitive load condition.    Latched Reset Signal  In some applications, the reset signal (nRST) should be  latched and the status will not be altered until another  low signal is detected. In order to achieve this goal, a D  flip-flop is adopted and its output (Q) is used as the  reset signal.  Figure 10 shows an example how to construct a latched  reset  signal.  Table  5  summarizes  the  design  requirements for Figure 10.

Design Requirements and Results  Design Requirements  Design Result  Single input  PB1  Latched output  Q  Do not react to input signal less than 5s  6s (MIN)  Reset pulse greater than 200ms  320ms (MIN)  ICC < 20µA  13.3μA (MAX)    Ensure the reset signal (nRST) has a fast slew rate to  assert the flip-flop once a positive-edge triggered D  flip-flop is taken. For the 74LVC1G74 in Figure 10, a  resistor of 1kΩ is recommended. To initialize the D  flip-flop to a known status, make sure that the RC time  constant of the delay capacitor (CDELAY) and delay  resistor (RDELAY) is 10 times of the rising time of the  input voltage to VCC. As the consequence, a clear  signal can be obtained and sent to the D flip-flop.    Power Supply Recommendations  A well-regulated power supply range from 1.6V to 6.5V  is recommended as the input. Besides, a 0.1µF  ceramic capacitor, though not mandatory, should be  placed near the VCC pin as a good design practice.    Layout Guidelines  Some design guidelines are provided below for the  SGM851 to lay out the printed circuit board (PCB).  1. Place the decoupling capacitor as close as possible  to the VCC pin of the device.  2. Use short traces for the VCC node. An LC tank can  be created by the VCC capacitor (CVDD) and its  parasitic inductance between the supply and the  capacitor. As a result, ringing waveforms can be  observed with peak voltage higher than the maximum  value at VCC pin.
