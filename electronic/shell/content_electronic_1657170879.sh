If the pole-frequency  is less than or comparable to the unity-gain bandwidth  (15MHz), the phase margin will be reduced, ringing in  the step response or sustained oscillation will be  generated.

One resistor is selected to limit the  current not to exceed the maximum rating value. In  Figure 4, a series input resistor is used to limit the input  current to less than 10mA, but the drawback of this  current-limit resistor is to contribute thermal noise at the  amplifier input.

Power supply  bypassing is an effective method to clear up the noise  at power supply, and the low impedance path to ground  of decoupling capacitor will bypass the noise to GND.  In application, 10μF ceramic capacitor paralleled with  0.1μF or 0.01μF ceramic capacitor is used in Figure 7.
