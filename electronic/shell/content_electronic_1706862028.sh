It is optimized for high voltage  operation from 3V to 32V single supply or ±1.5V to  ±16V dual supplies, and consumes only 240μA quiescent  current.  The LM321 features low power, low offset voltage and  low bias current. The device can offer high open-loop  voltage gain. It is well suited for various applications.  The LM321 is available in a Green SOT-23-5 package. It  is specified over the 0℃ to +70℃ temperature range.        "}'

OVERSTRESS CAUTION  Stresses beyond those listed in Absolute Maximum Ratings  may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to  absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods  may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any  conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended  Operating Conditions section is not implied.  ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION  This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are  not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all  integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions.  Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures  can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle  performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision  integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage  because even small parametric changes could cause the  device not to meet the published specifications.

It is  optimized for high voltage operation from 3V to 32V  single supply or ±1.5V to ±16V dual supplies. The input  common mode voltage range is from -0.1V to (+VS) -  1.5V.  This LM321 makes it easier to implement all conventional  operational amplifier circuits in a single-supply system,  such as DC amplifier modules and transducer amplifiers.  For instance, the device does not need extra ±5V  supplies to work with the interface electronics, as it can  be easily operated on the 5V source that is common for  digital systems.     Unity-Gain Bandwidth  The unity-gain bandwidth is the maximum supported  frequency which can be amplified by an amplifier  without distortion. The unity-gain bandwidth of LM321  is 1.1MHz.  Slew Rate  The slew rate is the time period for the output change  when input signal is changed. The slew rate of LM321  is 0.35V/μs.    Input Common Mode Voltage Range  The input common mode voltage range is from the  device ground to (+VS) - 1.5V. Also, the voltage level at  the inputs can reach VS without damaging the device. If  the users desire the correct phase at the output of the  operational amplifier, they need to make sure that at  least one of the inputs is within the input common mode  voltage range. If both of them are outside the input  common mode voltage range, the state of the output  will be undefined. However, if either input is below -0.3V,  the input current should be limited and the output state  will also be undefined.    Device Functional Modes  The LM321 can be operated as it is powered by a DC  power supply. The amplifier can be operated in  single-supply or dual-supply mode.       "}'

The inputs have the option to get  power before VS, which allows for more versatility in  circuits with multiple supplies.    Typical Application  The following circuit is an application of an inverting  amplifier. To explain, the input is positive while the output  is negative. However, if the input signal is negative, the  output will be positive as well.    VOUT + _ VIN +VS RF RI -VS     Figure 1. Application Schematic  The supply voltage range should always be larger than  the input and the output range. The following example  scales a signal with ±0.5V to ±1.8V, which means that  the ±12V of the supply voltage is sufficient.  The following equations determine the voltage gain of  the inverting amplifier circuit.  OUT IN V G = V                      (1)   1.8 G =   = -3.6 -0.5                   (2)   After setting the voltage gain, the value of the gain and  feedback resistors should be determined as well. Since  the operating current inside the circuit is in the mA  range, the RI and RF should be at the level of kΩ. In this  example, the RI is 10kΩ and the RF is 36kΩ.
