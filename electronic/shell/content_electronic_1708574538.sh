A high switching frequency of 1MHz (TYP) allows the  use of small inductors and provides fast transient  response as well as high output voltage accuracy by  using AHP-COT control topology.  With its wide operating input voltage range of 3V to 17V  and low quiescent current, SGM61103 is ideally suited  for battery-powered systems. The SGM61103 works in  power-save mode to ensure the highest efficiency at  light load conditions.  The SGM61103 supports up to 300mA continuous  output current at wide output voltages between 1.2V  and 10V. Lower-power EN comparator with precise  threshold and hysteresis can be used as the input  supply voltage supervisor (SVS). More hysteresis is  possible by combining with EN_HYS pin. PG pin is also  provided as output voltage indicator.  The SGM61103 is available in a Green TDFN-2×2-8AL  package.    "}'

It  operates at a quasi-fixed frequency of 1MHz and uses  AHP-COT PWM control for the moderate to heavy load  range. In order to achieve quasi-fixed frequency, it  adjusts on-time adaptively according to input voltage  and output voltage fed by the output voltage sense  (VOS) pin. For low converter drop, it can operate at 100%  duty cycle.  The SGM61103 transitions seamlessly from PWM  mode to pulse frequency modulation (PFM) once the  inductor current becomes discontinuous. At lighter load  conditions, it shifts to the power-save mode (PSM) to  minimize the losses. It also shuts down most of the  internal circuits in power-save mode. In this mode, one  or a few PWM pulses are sent to charge the output  capacitor and then the switches are kept off. The output  capacitor voltage gradually drops due to small load  current and when it falls below the nominal voltage  threshold, the PWM pulses resume. If the load is still  low, the output will go slightly higher than normal value  again and the switches will be turned off. In power-save  mode, the output voltage is slightly higher than the  nominal output voltage.    Under-Voltage Lockout Protection  Preventing from faulty logic in the internal circuit due to  low input supply voltage, the device includes an  under-voltage lockout (UVLO). The UVLO threshold is  set to 2.87V for VIN rising and 2.77V for VIN falling. The  device starts operation when the input voltage rises  above the rising threshold and shuts down when the  input voltage falls below the falling threshold. The  hysteresis between rising and falling threshold ensures  proper startup.    Enable Input (EN / EN_HYS)  In addition to the UVLO, the device includes an EN pin  which can enable or disable the device. When the input  voltage is above the UVLO threshold and the voltage at  EN pin is above VTH_EN_ON (1.22V), the device enters  soft-start and ramps up the output voltage after a delay  of 230μs. When the voltage at EN pin is below  VTH_EN_OFF (1.15V), the device will be shut down. The  hysteresis between VTH_EN_ON and VTH_EN_OFF is 70mV.  The EN pin cannot be floated. If there is no need to  control the EN function separately, connecting it to the  VIN.  EN_HYS is an open-drain output driven by EN  comparator. EN_HYS is pulled to ground if the input  voltage is above VUVLO_R and the voltage at EN pin is  below VTH_EN_ON. When the voltage at EN pin is above  VTH_EN_ON, EN_HYS becomes high-impedance state.

Using the EN Comparator as Input SVS for  Proper VOUT Ramp-Up    Soft Startup  A 460μs internal soft-start circuit is included to prevent  input inrush current and voltage drops during startup.  This circuit slowly ramps up the error amplifier  reference voltage after exiting the shutdown state or  under-voltage lockout (UVLO). Slow increase of the  output voltage prevents the excessive inrush current for  charging the output capacitors and creates a smooth  output voltage rise. The other advantage of a soft-start  is avoiding supply voltage drops especially on the high  internal impedance sources such as the primary cells  and rechargeable batteries.  The SGM61103 is also capable of starting with a  pre-biased output capacitor when it is powered up or  enabled. When the device is turned on, a bias on the  output may exist due to the other sources connected to  the load(s) such as multi-voltage ICs or simply because  of residual charges on the output capacitors. For  example, when a device with light load is disabled and  re-enabled, the output may not drop during the off  period and the device must restart under pre-biased  output condition. The output ramp is automatically  initiated with the bias voltage and ramps up to the  nominal output value. Without the pre-biased capability,  the device may not be able to start up properly.  Large output capacitors and high load currents may  exceed the current capability of the device during  startup. The high-side MOSFET switch current limit  may be triggered during startup, and the maximum  output current provided by device is half of the current  limit ILIM. In this case, the startup ramp of the output  voltage will be slower.    Power Good Output  The PG pin is an open-drain output. PG requires a  pull-up resistor. PG pin is pulled to GND before the  output voltage is above 95% of the nominal voltage.  After FB voltage reaches 95% of VREF, the PG pin is  pulled high immediately. When the FB voltage drops  below 90% of VREF, the PG pin will be pulled to GND.  Leave the PG pin unconnected when not used. Table 1  shows how the PG state is changed in different  conditions.

PG Open Collector Output    Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)  At moderate and heavy load condition, the SGM61103  operates in PWM mode with a switching frequency of  about 1MHz. The switching frequency is slightly  affected by VIN, VOUT and load condition. As the load  current decreases, it automatically exits PWM mode  when the inductor current is discontinuous.  Typically, the on-time in PWM can be calculated by:  OUT OUT ON IN sw IN V V 1 1 t V f V 1 MHz = × = ×         (8)   Then the peak current of inductor is:  IN OUT LP ON V V I t L − = ×             (9)  where:  tON: On-time of High-side switch (μs)  VIN: Input voltage (V)  VOUT: Output voltage (V)  fSW: Switching frequency in PWM (MHz)  L: Inductance (μH)  ILP: Peak current of inductor (A)    Power-Save Mode (PSM)  At light load condition, the SGM61103 shifts to the PFM  mode once the inductor current is discontinuous. If the  load current further decreases, the SGM61103 enters  into PSM mode when off time is longer than 8μs. The  switching frequency is reduced automatically in both  PFM and PSM mode.  In PSM mode, some internal control blocks are shut  down to minimize the losses. One or a few PWM pulses  are sent to charge the output capacitor and then the  switches are kept off. The output capacitor voltage  gradually drops due to small load current and when it  falls below the nominal voltage threshold, the PWM  pulses resume. If the load is still low, the output will go  slightly higher than normal again and the switches will  be turned off. In PSM mode, the switching frequency  varies with the load current. Because of the decrease of  frequency, the output voltage ripple is slightly higher  than that in PWM. This effect can be mitigated by a  larger output capacitor.    Low Dropout Operation (100% Duty Cycle)  When the input voltage reduces, the duty cycle  increases to keep the output voltage constant. When  the input voltage is lower than the regulation output  voltage, the output voltage drops, and the SGM61103  goes into 100% duty cycle mode. The high-side switch  is always on, and the output voltage is determined by  the load current times the RDSON composed by the  high-side switch and inductor.    Current Limit Protection  Limiting the switch current protects the switch itself and  also prevents over-current in the source and the  inductor. If the high-side (HS) switch current exceeds  the ILIM threshold, HS switch is turned off and the  low-side (LS) switch will be turned on to reduce the  inductor current and limit the peak value. The HS  switch is turned on again once the inductor current  drops to zero. At this time, the maximum output current  that the device can provide is about half of the ILIM.  Note that the measured peak current limit in the  closed-loop and open-loop test conditions is slightly  different, mainly due to the current comparator  propagation delay.    Thermal Shutdown Protection  A thermal shutdown function is implemented to prevent  damage caused by excessive heat and power dissipation.  Once the junction temperature exceeds +150℃, the  device is shut down. The device is released from  shutdown automatically when the junction temperature  decreases by 20℃.     3V to 17V, 300mA Buck Converter with  SGM61103  Adjustable Enable Threshold and Hysteresis      18  DECEMBER 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  APPLICATION INFORMATION In this section, power supply design with the SGM61103 synchronous Buck converter and selection of the external  component will be explained based on the typical application that is applicable for various input and output voltage  combinations.

Place  this capacitor right beside the VIN and GND pins. A  10μF ceramic capacitor with X5R or better dielectric  and 0805 or smaller size is sufficient in most cases. A  larger value can be selected to reduce the input current  ripple.  Inductor Selection (L)  The important factors for inductor selection are  inductance (L), saturation current (ISAT), RMS rating  (IRMS), DC resistance (DCR) and dimensions. Use  Equation 10 and 11 to find the inductor peak current  (IL_MAX) and peak-to-peak ripple current (∆IL) in static  conditions:  L L _MAX O _MAX ΔI I I 2 = +             (10)  L OUT SW 1 D ΔI V L f − = × ×             (11)   where:  IO_MAX: Maximum load current   D: Duty cycle  fSW: Switching frequency in PWM  ISAT should be higher than IL_MAX, and sufficient margin  should be reserved. More generally, the saturation  current above high-side current limit is enough.  Increasing the inductance can lower the ripple current  and RMS current. However, for inductors of the same  series and package, the larger the inductance, the  smaller the saturation current and the larger the DCR.  A larger inductance also reduces dynamic response.       3V to 17V, 300mA Buck Converter with  SGM61103  Adjustable Enable Threshold and Hysteresis      19  DECEMBER 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued) In applications that focus on high efficiency, it is also  necessary to consider the impact of AC resistance on  power supply efficiency. Usually, an inductor with  quality factor > 25 at the switching frequency is  selected, which can be used to characterize the AC  resistance characteristic of inductor.    Output Voltage Setting  An external resistor divider connected to FB pin is used  for setting the output voltage. Through adjusting R1 and  R2, the output voltage can be programmed to the  desired value. It is recommended to use 1% resistor to  achieve good output accuracy. Calculate R1 and R2  with Equation 12.  1 1 OUT FB 2 2 R R V V 1 0.8 1 R R     = × + = × +             (12)   The current flowing through R2 should be higher than  the current 1µA. A lower value of R2 increases the  robustness against noise injection, and higher values  reduce the current consumption, which can impact the  light load efficiency.  A feed-forward capacitor is recommended to improve  the performance of smooth transition into power-save  mode and reduce undershoot during load transient.  5pF is enough for typical applications.    Output Capacitor Selection (COUT)  This device is capable of operating with low ESR  ceramic capacitors to get low voltage ripple and fast  response. 10μF to 22μF capacitors with X7R or X5R  dielectric  type  are  recommended.  Minimum  capacitance of output ripple criteria can be calculated  from Equation 13.  L OUT SW OUT _RIPPLE ΔI C 8 f V = × ×         (13)   For output capacitor selection, transient response and  loop stability should also be considered. Bias voltage  may cause significant capacitance drops in the ceramic  capacitors. The effective deviation of a ceramic  capacitor can be as high as -50% to +20% of the  nominal value.

Follow the  guidelines below for designing a good layout for the  SGM61103.  • Place the input capacitor close to the device with the  shortest possible connection traces to minimize the  AC current loop.  • Share the same GND return point for the input and  output capacitors and locate it as close as possible  to the device GND pin to minimize the AC current  loops. Place the inductor close to the switching node  and connect it with a short trace to minimize the  parasitic capacitances coupled to the SW node.  • Keep the signal traces like the FB sense line away  from SW or other noisy sources.  • The VOS line should be connected as short as  possible to the output, ideally to the VOUT pin  terminal of the inductor.  • The exposed thermal pad must be soldered to the  circuit board for mechanical reliability and to achieve  appropriate power dissipation.
