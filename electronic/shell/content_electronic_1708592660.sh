In Figure 1, the ESD  diodes between the inputs and the power supply rails  will clamp the input voltage not to exceed the rails.  VP VN +VS -VS + _     Figure 1. Input Equivalent Circuit    Input Current-Limit Protection  For ESD diode clamping protection, when the current  flowing through ESD diode exceeds the maximum rating  value, the ESD diode and amplifier will be damaged, so  current-limit protection will be added in some applications.  One resistor is selected to limit the current not to exceed  the maximum rating value. In Figure 2, a series input  resistor is used to limit the input current, but the drawback  of this current-limit resistor is that it contributes thermal  noise at the amplifier input. If this resistor must be  added, its value must be selected as small as possible.  In addition, a clamping circuit on its inputs can sink  current (up to 20mA) when the input is (+VS) + 0.3V.  This is for protecting from a worst VIN short-circuit  condition, and any alternate would need to have some  sort of clamping behavior on its inputs. But in the  shutdown mode, the clamping circuit does not work.  In the circuit (Figure 2), the operational amplifier inputs  can handle a VIN pulse (20V pulses width 1μs, rise and  fall times 1ns).

Input Current-Limit Protection  Rail-to-Rail Output  The SGM8607-2 supports rail-to-rail output operation.  In single power supply application, for example, when  +VS = 3.3V, -VS = GND, 600Ω load resistor is tied from  OUT pin to ground, the typical output swing range is  from 0.032V to 3.25V.    Driving Capacitive Loads  The SGM8607-2 can directly drive a 1nF capacitor at  Gain = +20 or a 100pF capacitor at Gain = +1 without  oscillation. If greater capacitive load must be driven in  application, the circuit in Figure 3 can be used. In this  circuit, the IR drop voltage generated by RISO is  compensated by feedback loop.      Figure 3. Circuit to Drive Heavy Capacitive Load    Power Supply Decoupling and Layout  A clean and low noise power supply is very important in  amplifier circuit design. Besides of input signal noise,  the power supply is one of important source of noise to  the amplifiers through +VS and -VS pins. Power supply  bypassing is an effective method to clear up the noise  at power supply, and the low impedance path to ground  of decoupling capacitor will bypass the noise to GND.  In application, 10μF ceramic capacitor paralleled with  0.1μF or 0.01μF ceramic capacitor is used in Figure 4.  The ceramic capacitors should be placed as close as  possible to +VS and -VS power supply pins.   VN VP 10μF 0.1μF VOUT + _ +VS -VS (GND) VN VP 10μF 0.1μF VOUT + _ +VS 0.1μF 10μF -VS     Figure 4.

In high speed  application, the general method to eliminate noise is to  use a complete ground plane technique, and the whole  ground plane will help distribute heat and reduce EMI  noise pickup.    Reduce Input-to-Output Coupling  To reduce the input-to-output coupling, the input traces  must be placed as far away from the power supply or  output traces as possible. The sensitive trace must not  be placed in parallel with the noisy trace in same layer.  They must be placed perpendicularly in different layers  to reduce the crosstalk. These PCB layout techniques  will help to reduce unwanted positive feedback and  noise.    Typical Application Circuits  Difference Amplifier  The circuit in Figure 5 is a design example of classical  difference amplifier. If R4/R3 = R2/R1, then VOUT = (VP -  VN) × R2/R1 + VREF.        Figure 5. Difference Amplifier    High Input Impedance Difference Amplifier  The circuit in Figure 6 is a design example of high input  impedance difference amplifier. The added amplifiers at  the input are used to increase the input impedance and  eliminate drawback of low input impedance in Figure 5.        Figure 6. High Input Impedance Difference Amplifier    Active Low-Pass Filter  The circuit in Figure 7 is a design example of active  low-pass filter, the DC gain is equal to -R2/R1 and the  -3dB corner frequency is equal to 1/2πR2C. In this design,  the filter bandwidth must be less than the bandwidth of  the amplifier, and the resistor values must be selected  as low as possible to reduce ringing or oscillation  generated by the parasitic parameters in PCB layout.
