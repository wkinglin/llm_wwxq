The supply  voltage operates from 3V to 24V. The SGM37603 is  capable of driving up to 8 LEDs in series for 25mA  maximum LED current per string while achieving high  conversion efficiency. An adaptively current-regulated  method allows different LED string voltages while LED  current remains in regulation. The LED current is  programmed through an I2C interface or a PWM signal  input. These features make it optimized for compact  solutions and ideal for LCD display backlighting.  The SGM37603 is available in Green WLCSP-  1.78×1.36-12B  and  TDFN-3×3-12L  packages.  It  operates over an ambient temperature range of -40℃  to +85℃.    "}'

Functional operation of the device at any  conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended  Operating Conditions section is not implied.    ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION  This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are  not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all  integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions.  Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures  can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle  performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision  integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage  because even small parametric changes could cause the  device not to meet the published specifications.

The 11-bit code (0 to  2047) is in control of the LED current as follows:  When the code is from 128 to 2047, the average LED  current proportionally increases to the brightness code  and follows the relationship (see Figure 4):  ILED_AVG = 12.21μA × code  (1)  Where:  ILED_AVG = Average LED Current  When the code is from 8 to 127, the average LED  current is calculated by Equation 1, and the LED  current is in current-to-PWM control (see Figure 4) with  a constant maximum current, while the duty cycle  changes following the code.  When the code is from 1 to 7, the average LED current  exponentially increases to the brightness code and  follows the relationship by Equation 2 (see Figure 4).  The LED current is also in current-to-PWM control, and  the duty cycle is 8/128 constantly, and the amplitude of  current pulse is 16 times of its corresponding average  current.  ILED_AVG = 16.17μA × 1.14(2 × code - 2)  (2)  Code 0 programs 0 current.  When bit[4] is set to 1 in register 0x11, ramp function is  enabled. Then when bits[7:4] in registers 0x19 are not  all 0 (codes from 128 to 2047), the ramp rate is  128μs/step. When bits[7:4] in registers 0x19 are all 0  (codes from 1 to 127), the ramp rate is 1024μs/step.  For example, if the code is set from 1000 to 2000,  ILED_AVG will change from 12.21mA to 24.42mA, the  corresponding ramp rate = 128μs/step, so the ramp  time for ILED_AVG = (2000 - 1000) × 128μs = 128ms.

The I2C code is ignored and forbidden  to set to 0. The LED current is proportional with the  PWM duty cycle and the maximum LED current is  25mA.  When the PWM pin is constantly high, the VREF voltage  is regulated to 2048mV typically. When the duty cycle  of the input PWM signal is low, the regulation voltage is  reduced, and the LED current is reduced; therefore, it  achieves LED brightness dimming. The relationship  between the duty cycle and VREF regulation voltage is  given by Equation 3:  VREF = Duty × 2048mV  (3)  Where:  Duty = duty cycle of the PWM signal  2048mV = internal reference voltage  Then the value of VREF is the PWM-based code for  brightness dimming. The LED current increases  proportionally to the brightness code and is calculated  by the Equation 1 (see Figure 6). This is valid from  codes 1 to 2048. Code 0 programs 0 current. When the  code < 16, the LED current is in current-to-PWM control.  The duty cycle of the PWM is 1/8, and the amplitude of  current pulse is 8 times of its corresponding average  current. Figure 6 (a) shows the zoomed graph from  codes 0 to 16 in Figure 6. There is no ramp function in  this mode.  Thus, the user can easily control the WLED brightness  by controlling the duty cycle of the PWM signal. The  PWM frequency is in the range from 20kHz to 100kHz.

The code is equal to the PWM duty cycle  multiplied with the I2C brightness code (see Figure 7).  The average LED current increases proportionally to  the brightness code and is calculated by the Equation 1  (see Figure 8). This is valid from codes 1 to 2047. Code  0 programs 0 current. When the brightness code < 16,  the LED current is in current-to-PWM control. The duty  cycle of the PWM is 1/8, and the amplitude of current  pulse is 8 times of its corresponding average current.  Figure 8 (a) shows the zoomed graph from codes 0 to  16 in Figure 8.  When bit[4] is set to 1 in register 0x11, ramp function is  enabled. When bits[7:4] in registers 0x19 are not all 0  (codes from 128 to 2047), regardless of PWM duty  cycle, the ramp rate is 128μs/step. When bits[7:4] in  registers 0x19 are all 0 (codes from 1 to 127),  regardless of PWM duty cycle, the ramp rate is  1024μs/step. For example, if PWM duty cycle is set to  10% and the code is set from 1000 to 2000, ILED_AVG will  change from 1.221mA to 2.442mA, the corresponding  ramp rate = 128μs/step, so the ramp time for ILED_AVG =  (2000 - 1000) × 128μs = 128ms.
