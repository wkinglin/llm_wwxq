Note that VBUS = 3V may cause  leakage in some extreme conditions, and it is better to make it higher than 3.1V. For VBUS = VDD, VIL/VIH = 30%/70% of VBUS. For  VBUS = 3.3V and VDD = 5V, VIL/VIH = 20%/80% of VBUS.  5. Meet the 'loss of VDD' requirement of I2C fast mode. When VDD is lost, the leakage drawn from the pin is controlled.

The SGM58031Q supports both differential inputs and  single-ended inputs.  The SGM58031Q has two working modes: single-shot mode  and continuous conversion mode.  In single-shot mode, the ADC performs one conversion and  gives full settled data, while no data needs to be discarded.  Once ADC completes the conversion, it then goes to  low-power shutdown mode.   In continuous modes, the ADC begins a new conversion  automatically after a previous conversion is completed. Every  conversion result is given out. The data rate is equal to the  configured data rate.    Quickstart Guide  The basic connection of ADC is shown in Figure 3. The  communication interface is I2C compatible. The SGM58031Q  works in slave mode. The I2C address is configured as  0b1001000 (ADDR is connected to GND).  Figure 4 and Figure 5 show the demo read and write  operation sequences.  For example, writing to the configuration register 0x01 sets  the SGM58031Q to continuous conversion mode following  the order below:  1. First byte, 0b1001000 (first 7-bit is I2C address), the 8th bit  is read/write bit which is low writing now  2. Second byte, 0b00000001 (points to Config register 0x01)  3. Third byte, 0b10000100 (MSB of the Config register to be  written, Bit[8] = 0 means the continuous mode)  4. Fourth byte, 0b10000011 (LSB of the Config register to be  written, Bit[7:5] = '100' means data rate 100Hz)  For example, to read the conversion result from SGM58031Q,  the following order can be followed:  1. First byte, 0b1001000 (first 7-bit is I2C address), the 8th bit  is read/write bit which is low writing now  2. Second byte, 0b00000000 (points to Conversion register  0x00)  3. Third byte, 0b10010001 (first 7-bit is I2C address), the 8th  bit is read/write bit which is high reading now  4. Fourth byte, the SGM58031Q answers with the MSB of the  Conversion register  5.

It can be  configured as 2 differential inputs or 4 single-ended inputs.  Whether the input is configured as differential inputs or  single-ended inputs, the absolute voltage on any inputs pin  must be in the range from GND to VDD.    Analog Inputs  The SGM58031Q has a switched capacitor input stage.  There are charge and discharge current when ADC is working.

Except for effects of INL, noise, offset, and gain errors.    Aliasing  For some applications, an RC external filtering is recommended.    Operating Modes  The SGM58031Q has two working modes, continuous mode  and single-shot mode.  In continuous mode, the ADC begins a new conversion  automatically after a previous conversion is completed. Every  conversion result is given out.  In single-shot mode, if OS bit is written to '1', a single-shot  conversion is started, during the conversion process, the OS  bit is kept '0', and the chip doesn't response to OS bit  operation. If conversion data is ready, the OS bit is set to '1'  and the chip goes power-down automatically, and user can  write '1' to OS bit to call a single-shot conversion again.    Power-Up and Reset  When the SGM58031Q is powered up, all registers are reset  to default values.  The SGM58031Q supports I2C general call reset command.  Refer to I2C General Call section for more details.    Duty Cycling for Low Power  In some power sensitive application, the SGM58031Q can  work in sampling and power-down mode periodically. The  duty cycle of working time and power-down time can be  controlled by microcontroller flexibly.   For example, if the SGM58031Q is configured as sample data  rate at 960Hz, it can be operated with 125ms duty cycle. This  means that the chip needs to do single-shot conversion every  125ms, it will take the chip 3.2ms for sampling and then stay  in power-down mode for 121.8ms. Under this working mode,  it will reduce 39/40 power consumption compare with 960Hz  operation in continuous mode.

When the result exceeds the limited setting, the  chip can give an alert on the ALERT/RDY pin.  The comparator has two workings modes: traditional mode  and  window  comparator  mode.  These  modes  are  configurable. Under both working modes, the comparator can  be configured as latch output or no-latch output (COMP_LAT  bit in Config register). In latch output mode, the latched  comparator output can be cleared by issuing an SMBus alert  response or by reading the Conversion register. The  ALERT/RDY pin output active polarity (low or high) can be  configured by COMP_POL bit in Config register. Demos are  shown in Figure 7 and Figure 8.  The comparator output trigger waiting times can be set by  COMP_QUE[1:0] in Config register. It means comparator  output can wait until the ADC results beyond the threshold  configured times (which can be one, two, or four times). Refer  to Config Register section for more details.

ADC ENOB (ENOB = (20log (FS/Noise_RMS) - 1.76)/6.02)    Conversion Ready Pin  If ALERT/RDY pin is used as a conversion ready pin, follow   the operations below, firstly set the MSB (Most Significant Bit)  of the high threshold register to '1', secondly set the MSB of the  low threshold register to '0', and select COMP_QUE[1:0] in '00'  mode. It should be noted that COMP_QUE[1:0] can disable  this pin function. COMP_MODE and COMP_LAT have no  effect on this function.   The ALERT/RDY pin is an open-drain output, which needs a  pull-up resistor outside.  When the SGM58031Q works in continuous mode, the  ALERT/RDY pin gives a pulse (~8μs) at the end of every  conversion completion.  When the SGM58031Q works in single-shot mode, the  ALERT/RDY pin goes low (COMP_POL is set to '0') when the  conversion data is ready, and keeps low until the next  conversion starts. Please see demos in Figure 9 and Figure 10.     Digital Filter  The devices offer digital filter for filtering the digital data  stream coming from the delta-sigma modulator. The  implementation of the digital filter is determined by the ADC  data rate setting. When data rate is configured as 120, 100,  60, 50, 30, 25, 15, 12.5, 7.5 and 6.25, the device uses a  third-order Sinc filter (Sinc3). When data rate is configured as  200, 240, 400, 480, 800 and 960, the device uses a  fourth-order Sinc filter (Sinc4).  When ALERT/RDY is used as the conversion completed  indication pin, its default logic state is high (pulled up by the  external resistor) during the conversion. When the device  works in continuous mode, the ALERT/RDY pin will go low  and remain low for about 8μs, generating an 8μs logic low  pulse at the end of each conversion cycle. When the device  works in single-shot mode and the Sinc3 filter is used, the  ALERT/RDY pin will go logic low after the third data  conversion is finished and remain low until the device begins  the next new conversion (OS bit is set to '1' again), and the  ALERT/RDY pin goes logic high again during the new  conversion. When the device works in single-shot mode and  the Sinc4 filter is used, the ALERT/RDY pin will go low after  the fourth data conversion is finished and remain low until the  device begins the next new conversion (OS bit is set to '1'  again), and the ALERT/RDY pin goes logic high again during  the new conversion. Please see ALERT/RDY examples in  Figure 9 and Figure 10.

When it  is in latch mode, COMP_LAT is set to '1'. If an ADC result is  above the upper threshold or below the lower threshold, this  pin is set (active low or active high). And the pin output is  latched, it can be cleared by reading ADC conversion data, or  by issuing an SMBus alert response (reading the alerting  device I2C address).  The ALERT/RDY pin is an open-drain output, which needs a  pull-up resistor.  If an alert is output at the ALERT/RDY pin and latched, the  master controller accepts the alert, and sends an SMBus alert  command (0b00011001) to I2C bus. Any SGM58031Q on the  bus will response with their own address. The lowest I2C  address chip will occupy the bus and it will clear itself  ALERT/RDY pin. The chip which loses I2C bus will keep alert  on ALERT/RDY pin. The master will repeat SMBus alert  command until all salve chips clear their alerts.  In a multiple I2C devices system, two scenarios about clearing  an alert on ALERT/RDY pin need to be noted. The first  scenario is, when clearing an alert on ALERT/RDY pin of  SGM58031Q by sending a SMBus alert command (0x19), it  must be committed that there is only one SGM58031Q device  in the system, meanwhile make sure that SGM58031Q keeps  the lowest address. Another scenario is, when clearing an  alert on ALERT/RDY pin of SGM58031Q by reading data  register (0x00) of SGM58031Q, it needs to be committed that  there are multiple SGM58031Q chips in the system  (SGM58031Qs' data registers need to be read one by one) or  only one SGM58031Q chip in the system.  When ALERT/RDY pin is configured as window comparator  mode, if ADC result is higher than upper threshold or ADC  result is below the lower threshold, the pin is set (active low or  active high).   Timing diagram for SMBus alert response is shown in Figure  11.      RDY 8μs 1 conversion cycle   Figure 9.

The SGM58031Q can only act as slave devices. An I2C timing  diagram is shown in Figure 1.    I2C Address Selection  The SGM58031Q has a separate address setting pin ADDR,  which can be connected to GND, VDD, SDA and SCL. Table 8  shows the four available addresses.    Table 8. ADDR Pin Connection and Corresponding Slave  Address  ADDR Pin  Slave Address  GND  1001000  VDD  1001001  SDA  1001010  SCL  1001011    I2C General Call  The SGM58031Q supports I2C general call address (0000000)  and the eighth bit must be '0'. The device acknowledges the  general call address. And if the second byte is 00000110  (06h), the SGM58031Q resets all registers and goes to  power-down.    I2C Speed Modes  The I2C bus operation supports two speed modes: standard  mode and fast mode. See more details in Electrical  Characteristics section.  To enter standard and fast mode, no special operation is  needed.    Slave Mode Operations  The SGM58031Q works in slave mode and doesn't drive the  SCL line.
