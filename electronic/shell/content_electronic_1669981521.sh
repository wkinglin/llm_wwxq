They are specifically  designed for portable applications requiring minimum board  space and small external components. The charging profile  includes pre-charge, constant-current and constant-voltage  phases. Several safety and protection features are included  such as built-in safe charge timer to set maximum duration of  charge and pre-charge, input voltage and current monitoring,  internal (junction) and external (battery) temperature monitoring,  input current limiting and load current limiting. SGM41562A  can charge with a wide input voltage range of up to 18V  compared to the SGM41562B which has 5.75V charging  range, but the rest of their functions are the same.  The SGM41562A/B has 3 power ports: input power port (IN),  battery port (BAT) and system or load port (SYS). The system  is powered from the input whenever it is available. Input is  typically a USB power source. If the input source is weak or  removed, power source for the system will automatically switch  to the battery. The voltage and currents from input and  battery as power sources are continuously monitored to  prevent battery damage due to excessive currents or  over-discharge.  I2C serial interface is used to program the device functions  and parameters or to read its status. 12 read/write or read only  8-bit registers (REG00 to REG0B) are accessible. A watchdog  protection feature is also included. If this feature is enabled  and there is no in time read/write activity or signal from the  host, the device will reset the charging parameters to their  defaults and recycles power to the system (turn off/on) that  may reset the host.  The SGM41562A is capable of charging with input voltages  as high as 18V but with higher input voltages, the chip  temperature can easily rise up and thermal protection may  stop charging if proper cooling is not considered. The  SGM41562B goes into voltage protection state if VIN > 6V.  The input changes are continuously monitored and a system  power recycle (SYS) may occur if the system does not  response to the input toggles.  The SGM41562A/B is available in a Green WLCSP-1.52×1.52-9B  package. Device functionality and protection features are  assured in the ambient temperature range from -40℃ to  +125℃. Charging parameters are guaranteed in 0℃ to +55℃.  "}'

The charge features include pre-charge, fast charge including  constant-current mode (CCM) and constant-voltage mode  (CVM), end-of-charge termination, auto-recharge, and a  built-in safe charge timer. The safe charge timer is used to  prevent over-charging or other issues if the host runs out of  control.  A bypass switch between IN and SYS pins, and a battery  switch between SYS and BAT pins are integrated to provide  complete power path management (PPM). The switches have  low on-resistances to minimize loss and heat. System load is  primarily powered from the input when it is available, and the  remaining input power is used to charge the battery if needed.  When the input source is weak, the load is powered partially  from the battery. This mode in which the battery provides the  power deficit is called supplement mode. Battery will provide  the full load power if input is removed or if VIN is out of range.  For battery charging, the power to the battery is regulated by  the battery switch. To prevent faulty charge conditions, input  voltage, input current, system voltage, chip temperature and  external temperature (sensed by NTC) are continuously  monitored during charge.  Figure 3 shows the power paths and key internal blocks of the  device. The Qbypass switch regulates the voltage of the  system and the internal charge circuit. The Qrvs switch acts  as a near ideal blocking diode to prevent reverse power (or  leakage) from the load (SYS pin) back to the input (IN pin).  The Qswitch switch is responsible for battery charging  regulation and connecting or disconnecting of the battery  (BAT pin) to the system (SYS pin). The charge and discharge  circuits in the Figure 3 that are connected to the IN and BAT  pins have their own independent UVLO and power supply.  The rest of the chip is powered by either IN or SYS pin,  whichever has the higher voltage. The I/F interface (I2C  communication and nINT) block is active whenever any of the  power sources (IN or BAT pin) are available.    Qswitch   Qbypass IN SYS Qrvs BAT System Load Power Input UVLO  Charge Circuit UVLO  Discharge  Circuit I/F Interface   Figure 3. Power Path Management Structure  The chip has a watchdog timer as a protective feature against  unexpected host malfunctions. When watchdog timer is  enabled, it must be reset by host regularly to prevent  watchdog timer overflow that results in a chip reset and power  recycle. Watchdog reset is by writing into the watchdog  register through I2C interface (I/F). If the watchdog is not reset  on time, the power to the host will recycle.  The power fed to the SYS pin is recycled when watchdog  times out, the host does not response to IN power input  (when watchdog is forced on) or COLD_RESET bit is set to 1,  to clear the running environment before system program  upgrade or release from locked situations.  Input Detection  Figure 4 shows how the input voltage status is detected and  affects the device function along with the relevant timings and  nINT output signal updates. The device continuously monitors  the input voltage at the IN node. The SYS node and charge  circuit is only started and connected to the input when for a  duration of tINI, VIN is within its normal range (above VIN_UVLO  and below VIN_OVLO). Qbypass and Qrvs switches will turn off  as soon as an input UVLO or OVLO is detected.  As shown in Figure 4 any input state is considered stable if it  continuously stays in the same condition for a duration of tPWD  after which the device sends out a negative pulse to the nINT  pin with a pulse width of tINT_PULSE to inform the host about the  input state change.  The watchdog timer WATCHDOG[1:0] register is set to 01  once the valid input is detected and when an INT pulse is  asserted, which resumes its original setting when any writing  to this device occurs. If the host does not clear the watchdog,  power to the host is recycled for reset when watchdog runs  time out.

VSYS_REG is selected by programming  VSYS_REG[3:0] register, the lower 4 bits of REG07 (also  called system voltage register or VSYS_REG[3:0] register).  However, the actual system voltage (VSYS) can be affected by  the input voltage level, input current limit and battery voltage.  I2C commands can directly control the power paths. Input  path will be disconnected (high-impedance) by turning off  Qbypass switch if the EN_HIZ bit is set to 1. If the battery is  getting charge and Qswitch switch is on, it can also be  disconnected by setting charge enable bit, set the CEB bit to  1 (turn off Qswitch switch in charge direction). The power path  control bits are explained in Table 1. When these bits are  clear, they have no effect.  Table 1.

Battery Charge Profile  Figure 5 shows the battery charge profile used in this device.  The charge phases are explained below. Depending on the  I2C settings and the battery state of charge (SOC), some or  all of the phases may be skipped or used to finish a complete  charge cycle as explained below:  Pre-Charge: If the battery voltage is less than the pre-charge  threshold (VBAT_PRE), the battery is charged with the small  pre-charge current (IPRE). The pre-charge current value is the  same as the termination current (ITERM) that is programmed  via bit D[3:0] of the REG03, also called ITERM[3:0].  Constant-Current Charge: When battery voltage is higher  than VBAT_PRE, and less than VBAT_REG, it will be charged with a  constant current. The constant-current value is determined by  bit D[5:0] of the REG02 that is called ICC[5:0] and a single  scaling bit that if set, multiplies it by ¼. This bit is used for  finer CC adjustment (CC_FINE bit in REG0A).  Constant-Voltage Charge: When the battery voltage reaches  to the VBAT_REG, the voltage is kept constant and the charge  current drown by battery will start to fall. The VBAT_REG value is  determined by bit D[7:2] of the REG04 that is also called  VBAT_REG[5:0].  Charge Termination: A charge termination is recognized  when the charge current drops to a small value represented by  ITERM. If the termination detection is enabled by setting the  EN_TERM bit in REG05 D[4] to 1, then if the charge current  (ICHG) stays equal or lower than ITERM for a period of tTERM_DGL  (termination deglitching time) the charge cycle is considered  complete and charging current will be turned off and drop to  zero. With no termination, the charge current will continue to  drop. Note that a charge cycle is also considered complete and  charging will be turned off, if the safe timer function runs out of  time provided that the safe timer function is already enabled  by setting EN_TIMER bit in REG05 D[3] to 1.

Battery Charge Profile       SGM41562A  500mA Single-Cell Li-Ion Battery Charger  SGM41562B  with Power Path Management      15  JANUARY2022  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued)  The charge status is updated to 'charge complete' once the  termination condition is detected. The charge current will be  terminated when termination conditions are met and if the  TERM_TMR bit is set to 0 (REG05 D[0] = 0); the charge will not  terminate and current keeps decreasing if TERM_TMR bit is 1.  During the whole charging process, the actual charge current  may fall below the set values due to the other regulations or  controls such as dynamic power management (DPM)  regulation caused by insufficient input voltage or current or  due to thermal regulation. In thermal regulation the device  reduces the power path currents to keep junction temperature  below the programmed limit.  A new charge cycle starts when one of the following  conditions occurs:    The input power recycles (input on/off).   Battery charging is enabled by I2C command.   Auto-recharge kicks in due to battery charge state.  If all the following conditions are satisfied:    No NTC thermistor temperature fault.   No safety (charge) timer fault.   No battery over-voltage event.   The Qswitch switch is not forced to turn off (e.g. CEB = 1).    Battery Over-Voltage Protection  SGM41562A/B has a built-in battery over-voltage protection  limit. A battery over-voltage event is detected when battery  voltage is higher than VBAT_OVP + VBAT_REG. When this event  occurs, the charging is immediately suspended and a fault is  asserted. The discharging path will be turned on if battery  over-voltage condition does not clear and continues.  Input Current and Input Voltage Based  Power Management  Usually the input source (typically USB) is not strong enough  for all system power demands and a power management  scheme is needed to keep the system voltage in desired level  without over loading the source. Figure 6 shows the power  management profile and explains how it is implemented in  SGM41562A/B  including the  battery  assist  operation  (supplement) when input source is not able to provide  required power.  The input current is continuously monitored to make sure the  input source maximum current limit specification is met. The  total input current limit is programmable by I2C and is used to  prevent over loading of the input source.   If the input source is weak and the programmed input current  limit is higher than the effective capability of the source (like in  a dynamic loading condition) the back-up power management  will come in effect to prevent over loading of the input source.  The back-up power management is based on limiting the  input voltage drop to VIN_MIN value (programmable). The  voltage based dynamic power management (DPM) will  regulate the input voltage to VIN_MIN when the load is higher  than the input current capacity. If input current and voltage  limit are both reached, then the Qbypass switch (between IN  and SYS pins) will regulate and limit the total power taken  from the input. With the power limiting, if the system voltage  drops to the minimum value of (VSYS_REG - 90mV) or the input  voltage falls below (VIN - 160mV), the device will finally  reduce the charge current to prevent further voltage drops.  The programmed VIN_MIN must be at least 250mV higher than  VBAT_REG to assure stable operation of the regulator.

Dynamic Power Management and Battery Supplement Operation Profile    Battery Supplement Mode  As mentioned above, the DPM will reduce the charge current  to keep the input current or voltage in regulation when source  power is not sufficient for system demand. If the charge  current is reduced to zero but still due to heavy system load  the input source is overloaded and VSYS continues to drop,  then the battery will supply the deficit to assist the input  source. This mode is called battery supplement mode in  which the battery provides IDSCHG as supplement current to  the load. This mode starts when the system drop reaches to  30mV below the battery voltage. In this mode the Qswitch  switch acts as a near ideal diode from battery to the system.  The Qswitch switch is controlled to regulate and maintain the  VBAT - VSYS drop to a fixed 10mV value when IDSCHG ×  RON_BATFET is less than 10mV. If IDSCHG × RON_BATFET is larger  than 10mV, the Qswitch switch is fully turned on to pass  battery voltage to the system with minimum drop.  In the battery supplement mode the ideal diode mode will be  disabled as soon as the system load decreases and VSYS  exceeds the VBAT + 20mV value.  When VIN source is not available, the device operates in  discharge mode (battery power) in which the Qswitch switch  is always fully on to reduce the losses.  Battery Regulation Voltage  The battery voltage for the constant-voltage regulation phase  (CV) is represented by VBAT_REG.  Thermal Regulation and Shutdown  SGM41562A/B continuously monitors its internal junction  temperature to avoid junction overheating while keeping the  power delivery at its maximum. When the internal junction  temperature reaches its programmable limit (TJ_REG), the  device starts to reduce the charge current to prevent higher  power  dissipation.  The  thermal  regulation  limit  is  programmable to help adjusting the design for the thermal  requirements in different applications. 4 different junction  temperature regulation thresholds (default 120℃) can be  chosen by programming the TJ_REG[1:0] register. In  particular, it is recommended that the junction temperature be  set not lower than the ambient temperature at which the  device charging behavior may occur.  The device fixed thermal shutdown limit (TJ_SHDN) is slightly  higher than the highest programmable TJ_REG. If TJ rises  above this limit, both Qbypass and Qswitch switches will turn  off.           SGM41562A  500mA Single-Cell Li-Ion Battery Charger  SGM41562B  with Power Path Management      17  JANUARY2022  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued)  NTC Function and VDD Gating  The NTC pin is provided to sense the battery temperature  using an NTC thermistor. Thermistors are usually included in  the rechargeable battery packs to ensure safe operation by  monitoring the battery temperature and making sure it is  between hot and cold limits. To adjust the temperature limits  for the device, two resistors (RT1 and RT2 in Figure 13) should  be connected to NTC pin as a divider between VDD and GND  pins. The thermistor itself is connected between NTC pin and  GND. The voltage on the NTC pin is determined by all three  resistors. This resistor divider along with the hot and cold limit  voltages defined in the EC table determines the hot-cold  operating window. Note that due to the negative temperature  coefficient of NTC, when its voltage drops below VHOT, it  means the battery temperature is exceeding the hot limit. The  NTC protection function can be disabled by clearing the  EN_NTC bit to 0. The default settings for NTC function are  the PCB OTP levels specified in EC table that can be change  by I2C as explained in Table 2.  Table 2. NTC Function Selection  I2C Control  Function  EN_NTC  EN_PCB OTP  0  don't care  Disable  1  1  NTC  1  0  PCB OTP  NTC function only works in charge mode. When NTC pin  voltage falls out of the hot-cold window it means that the  temperature is outside the safe operating range and results in  a pause in charging and sets the fault bits. Charging will  resume when the temperature falls back into the safe range.  If DIS_VDD bit is disabled and VIN is removed, VDD power  turns off and becomes high-impedance leaving only RT2 in  parallel with the NTC thermistor. If DIS_VDD bit is enabled,  VDD remains active. VDD uses battery power if VIN is removed.  With PCB OTP selected, if the NTC pin voltage is lower than  the NTC hot threshold, Qbypass and Qswitch switches will  turn off. The PCB OTP fault also will set the NTC_FAULT  status bit to 1. The operation will resume when the NTC pin  voltage goes back above the NTC hot threshold.  Safety Timer  Using an internal safety timer, SGM41562A/B is capable to  limit the maximum duration of the pre-charge and charge  periods to avoid extended charging cycles that may happen  due to abnormal battery conditions. This protection can be  disabled by I2C. The safety timer starts counting if one of the  following occurs:   A new charge cycle is started.   Write in REG01 D[3] bit: from 1 to 0 (charge enable)   Write in REG05 D[3] bit: from 0 to 1 (safety timer enable)    Write in REG02 D[7] bit: from 0 to 1 (software reset)    Write in REG0A D[4] bit: from 0 to 1 (software power recycle)  The safety time limit is 1 hour for pre-charge condition in  which the battery voltage stays lower than VBAT_PRE and  cannot go higher. For the charge phase the time limit is  programmable through I2C and the safety timer starts  counting when the battery enters in constant-current charge  mode or constant-voltage charge mode.  Host Mode and Default Mode  SGM41562A/B can operate in either default mode (with default  parameters) or host mode (parameters programmed by host).  It will go to the default mode if one of the following occurs:    Input refresh with no battery connected.   Re-insert battery with no input source connected.   Device registers reset by writing 1 to REG_RST bit.   Watchdog timer expiry.  Upon a power-on reset, the device starts in default mode and  in the same state as if watchdog timer expiration has  occurred. In this mode all registers take their default values,  including EN_HIZ = 0 and CEB = 1, that means the input  power path is enabled and device is set to battery discharge  mode. Note that by default the battery will not be charged  after a reset.  When the device is in the host mode, watchdog function can  be activated and works in both charge and discharge modes  (Watchdog timer is independent of the charge safety timer).  Watchdog timer can be enabled by programming a non-zero  expiry time in its register, that is WATCHDOG[1:0] ≠ 00. If  watchdog timer is enabled, it must be reset regularly before it  runs out of time by writing 1 to WD_RST bit in REG02.  Otherwise the watchdog timer will expire and results in a  power recycle to the system. Therefore, resetting the  watchdog timer by host must happen in the intervals shorter  than watchdog time limit. The power recycle is performed by  turning off Qswitch and Qbypass for a duration of tRST_DUR and  then turning them on again. After watchdog timer expiration,  all registers will reset to their default values and the device  goes to the default mode.   To reduce the quiescent current during discharge mode, the  watchdog  timer  can  be turned  off  by  setting  the  EN_WD_DISCHG bit to 0. If the WATCHDOG[1:0] is set to 00,  the watchdog timer is disabled under charge and discharge  modes independent of the EN_WD_DISCHG bit value.   SGM41562A  500mA Single-Cell Li-Ion Battery Charger  SGM41562B  with Power Path Management      18  JANUARY2022  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued)  Battery Discharge Function  If the battery is connected (VBAT is above the VBAT_UVLO  threshold) and the input source is missing, the Qswitch turns  fully on. The low on resistance of the Qswitch minimizes the  conduction loss during discharge. The quiescent current of  the device is as low as 12μA in this mode. By setting REG0A  D[3] bit to 1, the Qswitch will stay on even if the rest of the  internal blocks are turned off, to reduce the device quiescent  current to less than 1.2μA. The low on-resistance and low  quiescent current of the device extend the run time.  Over-Discharge Current Protection  The over-discharge current protection is effective in discharge  mode and supplement mode. If the IBAT exceeds discharge  current limit value programmed in the REG03 D[7:4], the  Qswitch turns off after a wait delay (tDSCHG_CUT) and then  resumes conducting after a retry delay time (tRETRY).   When the battery voltage falls below the VBAT_UVLO limit that is  programmed in the REG01 D[2:0], the Qswitch turns off to  prevent over-discharging the battery.  If SWITCH_MODE bit (REG0A D[3]) is set to 1, the Qswitch is  forced to remain on like a simple switch and the over-  discharge is ignored during battery discharge. This bit will  reset if power is re-applied to the input. It will also reset if the  battery is connected or disconnected while power is applied  to the input.  System Short Circuit Protection  If a short circuit (to GND) occurs on the load connected to  SYS pin, the Qswitch disconnects the BAT to SYS path and  the Qbypass limits the current flowing in the IN to SYS path. If  the short circuit persists, the die temperature goes high and  causes a thermal shutdown.  Interrupt to Host (nINT Pin)  The nINT output signal is provided to alert the host on power  events. SGM41562A/B sends out a negative pulse (width =  tINT_PULSE) to nINT if any of the following events occurs:   A good input source is detected (UVLO < VIN < OVLO).   UVLO or OVLO is detected (input).   Charge completed.   A charging status change.   A fault record in REG09 occurs (input fault, thermal fault,  safety timer fault, battery OVP fault or NTC fault).   Watchdog expiration (WTD_FAULT in REG08 D[7]).  When one of the mentioned faults occurs, the relevant fault  bit will latch in the register except for NTC fault bit that always  reports the current status of the thermistor. A fault status bit is  unlatched if the device quits that fault state. It will reset to 0  after the host reads the register if the bit is unlatched.   The assertion of nINT signal pulse can be masked for some  of the events listed above when the corresponding mask  control bits are set in REG06 D[4:0]. If a mask bit is set, and  the event occurs, the nINT signals stays high.  The nINT pin is also used as an input to initiate a power  recycle on the SYS output for example when a turn off/turn on  is needed on the system when battery is not removable. This  input is also used to exit the shipping mode that keeps the  battery disconnected.

It is performed by forcing  the Qswitch to remain off by setting FET_DIS bit to 1. Table 3  explains how the SGM41562A/B can be programmed in  shipping mode (or to do a power recycle on SYS) and how to  exit the shipping mode. To exit shipping mode either the input  power should be applied to IN port, or a low voltage (ground)  should be applied to nINT pin for a short time (for example by  holding a push bottom).  Table 3.

If  the bit is set to 1, the device enters the shipping mode after a  delay time, which can be programmed by EN_SHIP_DGL[1:0].  After the delay the Qswitch turns off and the FET_DIS bit  resets to 0. The device wakes up from shipping mode by  pulling down nINT pin or detecting an acceptable voltage on  the IN pin. The device exits from shipping mode 2 seconds  after pulling nINT pin down or 64ms after detecting an  acceptable VIN. For the application of nINT pulled down to a  low voltage in the shipping mode, EN_SHIP_DGL[1:0] must  keep default value.      System power can be recycled by turning off the Qswitch and  Qbypass if nINT pin is pulled low for a duration of more than  tRST_DGL. It is the time delay to avoid noise and glitches or to  hold a push bottom. The tRST_DGL time is programmed by  tRST_DGL[1:0] in REG01. The off state lasts for a duration of  tRST_DUR which can be programmed via tRST_DUR in REG01.  After this time the Qswitch and/or Qbypass will be  automatically turned on and the system is powered again.  During the off period, the nINT pin is biased to a lower  voltage.

The RT1 and RT2 resistors (see Figure 12) allow  independent programming of the high and low temperature  limits for any type of NTC temperature characteristics.  VDD NTC RT2 RNTC RT1 Low Temp Threshold VCOLD Hot Temp Threshold VHOT     Figure 12. NTC Function Block  For a given NTC thermistor, if the NTC resistances at the  desired high and low temperatures are RNTCH and RNTCL  respectively, RT1 and RT2 values can be calculated by:  ( ) ( ) ( ) − × × = − × − − × COLD HOT NTCH NTCL T2 HOT COLD HOT NTCL COLD COLD HOT NTCH V V R R R V V V R V V V R     ( ) − = × COLD T1 T2 NTCL COLD 1 V R R / /R V   where VCOLD and VHOT thresholds values are voltage levels on  the NTC pin given in the EC table for hot and cold detection.  For example, for a thermistor with R25℃ = 10kΩ and β = 3260,  RNTCL is 27.2kΩ at TCOLD = 0℃, and RNTCH is 4.29kΩ at THOT =  50℃. Using Equation 1 and Equation 2 to calculate RT1 =  7.6kΩ and RT2 = 29.33kΩ (to be recalculated when the EC  table mean values are characterized), assuming that the NTC  window is between 0℃ and 50℃ and using the VCOLD and  VHOT values from the EC table.  External Capacitor Selection  Like many low-dropout regulators, SGM41562A/B requires  external capacitors on its power ports for stability and noise or  spike voltage immunity. These capacitors must be properly  selected and placed near the device.  Input Capacitor (IN to GND)  A minimum 2.2μF input capacitor must be connected between  IN and GND pins for stable operation over full load range. In  general an output capacitance larger than the input capacitor  is acceptable if the input capacitor is at least 2.2μF.  Output Capacitor (SYS to GND)  SGM41562B is designed specifically to operate with small  ceramic output capacitance. A ceramic capacitor (X5R or X7R)  larger than 2.2μF is suitable for the SGM41562A/B  applications. The output capacitor should be connected close  to the device between SYS and GND pins with thick traces  and small loop area.   BAT to GND Capacitor  A capacitor is needed between BAT and GND pins. Use a  ceramic capacitor (X5R or X7R) that is at least 2.2μF.  VDD to GND Capacitor  VDD voltage powers the internal control and logic circuit. It is  critical to use a 0.1μF decoupling ceramic capacitor between  VDD pin and GND close to the device with thick PCB traces  to decouple noise and stabilize VDD voltage.   PCB Layout Guide  1. Place external capacitors as close as possible to the  device to minimize stray inductances and connection  impedance.  2. The GND for the I2C signals should be clean and directly  connected to GND pin, without sharing its route with GND  returns that carry high current or switching currents.   3. Due to relatively slow rise/fall times, it is ok to route the  I2C wires in parallel on the same PCB layer.
