The device supports  rail-to-rail input operation. It is suitable for portable  equipment. Open-drain structure needs external pull-up  resistor. The SGM8750 can be compatible with CMOS  and TTL logics.    Output Structure  In Figure 1, the SGM8750 has an open-drain output  stage. When output is changed from logic high to low,  the changed sink current pulls output pin to logic low.  Beginning this transition, larger sink current is used to  create a high slew rate transit from high to low. Once  the output voltage reaches VOL, it will reduce the sink  current to a just right value to maintain the VOL static  condition. This current-driven open-drain output stage will  significantly reduce the power consumption in application  system.  If low slew rate transition is needed in system design,  adjusting the load capacitance will change the slew rate.  The heavier capacitive load will slow down the output  voltage transition. This feature will be used to reduce  the interference generated by fast edge of transition  between 1 and 0 in noise-sensitive system.    GND ISINK Output 4.7kΩ VCC     Figure 1.

This ceramic  capacitor must be placed as close to VCC pin as  possible.   For grounding, unbroken and low-inductance ground  plane is a good choice.   For Layout, use short PCB trace to avoid unwanted  parasitic feedback around the comparator.
