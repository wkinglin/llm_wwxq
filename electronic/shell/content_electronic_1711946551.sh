For SGM61024A, to keep the high efficiency  in the whole load range, the device operates in pulse  width modulation (PWM) mode at normal load and  automatically enters the power-save mode (PSM) at  light loads. The minimum static current is only 5.7µA to  maintain its high efficiency. For SGM61024B, the  device operates in force PWM mode at light and heavy  loads.  With its adaptive hysteresis and pseudo-constant  on-time control (AHP-COT) architecture, the load  transient performance is excellent and the output  voltage regulation accuracy is achieved.  The device is available in a Green UTDFN-1.5×1.5-6L  package.  "}'

For SGM61024A, the device works in pulse width  modulation (PWM) mode at medium to heavy loads.  When the load current falls, it transitions seamlessly from  PWM mode to pulse frequency modulation (PFM) once  the inductor current becomes discontinuous. At lighter  load conditions, it shifts to the power-save mode (PSM) to  minimize the losses. It also shuts down most of the  internal circuits in power-save mode. In this mode, one or  few PWM pulses are sent to charge the output capacitor  and then the switches are kept off. The output capacitor  voltage gradually drops due to small load current and  when it falls below the nominal voltage threshold, the  PWM pulses resume. If the load is still low, the output will  go slightly higher than normal value again and the  switches will be turned off. In power-save mode, the  output voltage is slightly higher than nominal output  voltage. For SGM61024B, the device works in force PWM  mode at full load range. In PWM mode, the device works  with a nominal switching frequency of 2.2MHz.    Under-Voltage Lockout (UVLO)  The device implements the under-voltage lockout  (UVLO) with a 160mV hysteresis. When the input  voltage falls below the VUVLO, it shuts down the device.    Device Enable and the Output Discharge  FET  When the input voltage is valid, pulling the EN input to  logic high to enable the device and pulling it low to shut it  down. In the shutdown mode, the switches and all control  circuits are turned off to reduce the device current to  0.05μA. During shutdown, an internal FET is turned on  and connects the SW pin to the GND for smooth  discharge of the output.    Soft-Start and Pre-biased Startup  When EN is set to logic high and after internal delay, the  device starts switching and VOUT increases with 1.4ms  internal soft-start circuit. The soft-start is critical to prevent  excessive inrush currents and to avoid triggering of the  output over-current protection to provide a smooth output  rise. It also prevents extreme input voltage drops due to  large inrush current over the high-impedance batteries  and input sources that can interrupt the power-up. The  device is also capable of starting with a pre-biased output  capacitor when it is powered up or enabled. When the  device is turned on, a bias on the output may exist due to  the other sources connected to the load(s) such as  multi-voltage ICs or simply because of residual charges  on the output capacitors. For example, when a device  with light load is disabled and re-enabled, the output may  not drop during the off period and the device must restart  under pre-biased output condition. The output ramp is  automatically initiated with the bias voltage and ramps up  to the nominal output value. Without the pre-biased  capability, the device may not be able to start up properly.    Power Good (PG)  There is the PG function inside the device. PG is an  open-drain output with 1mA sinking capability. This pin  should be pulled up with an external resistor to a logic  high rail which is no more than 5.5V unless it is not used.  The PG signal is in high-impedance state when the output  voltage is in regulation range. Table 1 shows how the PG  state is changed in different conditions. PG remains low  until VOUT comes up to 96% to 105% of its nominal (set)  value. PG function has hysteresis effect. When PG is high,  it will go low if VOUT changes down to 92% or up to 110%  of its nominal (set) value. When the device is disabled,  under-voltage lockout or in thermal shutdown, the PG pin  is driven to low.   The PG output is useful for power supply sequencing as  well. Usually, the multiple power rails of a system need to  be powered in a specific sequence for proper startup. The  PG output of the leading power supply is connected to the  EN input of the subsequent power supply to implement  such sequencing. If not used, the PG pin needs to keep  floating. The PG signal has a rise delay of 100µs and a  fall delay of 18µs.  Table 1.

The switching frequency  is slightly affected by VIN, VOUT and load condition.  Then a fixed on-time architecture is activated and for  SGM61024B, the typical on-time is tON = 450ns ×  (VOUT/VIN). For SGM61024A, it automatically exits PWM  mode when the inductor current is discontinuous.    Power-Save Mode (PSM) at Light Loads:  SGM61024A  Once the load current decreases, the SGM61024A will  enter power-save mode. Then, the device has a  reduced switching frequency and works with the  minimum quiescent current to keep high efficiency. In  power-save mode, the inductor current is discontinuous  and the output voltage is slightly higher than nominal  output voltage. This effect can be mitigated by a larger  output capacitor.     Minimum Duty Cycle and 100% Duty Cycle  Due to the reduction of the switching frequency for  regulation, the device has no minimum duty cycle set.  When the input voltage gradually drops to the  regulation output voltage, the device can operate at  100% duty cycle and keep the high-side MOSFET  continuously on for minimal input-to-output voltage  difference. The low-side MOSFET is kept off. In this  mode, the lowest input voltage for keeping the output  regulated is determined by load current and the  resistive drops from the input to the output as given in  Equation 1:   VIN_MIN = VOUT + IOUT_MAX × (RDSON + RL)    (1)  where:  • VIN_MIN is the minimum input voltage to maintain output  voltage in regulation.   • IOUT_MAX is the maximum output current.   • RDSON is high-side MOSFET on-resistance.   • RL is inductor DC resistance (DCR).    Switch Current Limits and Short-Circuit  Protection (Hiccup)  Limiting the switch current protects the switch itself and  also prevents over-current of the source and the  inductor. If the high-side (HS) switch current exceeds  the ILIM threshold, HS switch is turned off and the  low-side (LS) switch is turned on to reduce the inductor  current and limit the peak current. If 32 cycles  consecutive repetition of this event occur, the device  stops switching. A new startup is initiated automatically  (hiccup) after 200μs. The hiccup repeats until the  overload or short-circuit fault is cleared.  LS switch current limit is also integrated in the device.  Each cycle, the HS switch is not allowed to turn on until  the LS current is below the low-side FET current limit.    Thermal Protection and Shutdown  Thermal protection is included to protect the die against  overheating damage. If the junction temperature  exceeds TSD threshold, the switching is stopped and  the device is shut down. An automatic recovery with a  soft-start begins when the junction cools down for 18℃  below the TSD limit.         2.4V to 5.5V, 2A  SGM61024  Synchronous Buck Converter      16  MARCH 2024  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  "}'

In most cases, a 4.7μF low ESR multilayer  ceramic input capacitor with X5R or better dielectric is  recommended, a larger value reduces input voltage  ripple and improves system. If the input cable or PCB  copper is too long, it is suggested to add another input  capacitor as C1 in the schematic diagram and place it  as indicated by the recommended layout later.    Inductor Selection  The inductor current ripple is determined by the  inductance value (L). A lower inductance results in  higher  peak-to-peak current that increases the  converter conduction losses. On the other hand, a large  inductance results in slower transient response and  larger size. ISAT should be higher than IL_MAX, and  sufficient margin should be reserved. Generally, the  saturation current above high-side current limit is  enough. The inductor initial tolerance can be as high as  -20% to +20% of the nominal value and proper current  derating is usually required.   Equation 2 can be used to choose the inductance value  based on ∆IL.

First choose R2 value below 100kΩ to avoid high noise  sensitivity on the FB pin. Do not choose a very small  value for R2 otherwise the loss will be increased on this  resistor that reduces the light load efficiency.

Output Capacitor Selection  For output capacitor design, output ripple, transient  response and loop stability should be considered.  Choosing ceramic capacitor with X5R or better  dielectric  is  very  important  for  temperature  characteristics. Bias voltage can cause significant  capacitance drops in the ceramic capacitors. The  effective deviation of a ceramic capacitor can be as  high as -50% to +20% of the nominal value. For this  example, the output capacitance is recommended to  use 2 × 10µF.    Thermal Considerations  Especial care must be taken for power dissipation and  thermal relief in high power density designs. The  SGM61024  is  a  low-profile  and  fine-pitch  surface-mount package that is typically used in a small  area or volume. Thermal coupling, airflow and heat  sinking must be considered in the system level and the  space between heat generating elements must be  managed properly.  To enhance the thermal performance, the PCB itself  has a significant role and to help transfer the heat away  by using large copper traces/planes that are connected  to the device pins (and thermal pads if present).  Considering a proper airflow in the system can  complete the thermal relief for reliable operation of the  power supply.         2.4V to 5.5V, 2A  SGM61024  Synchronous Buck Converter      18  MARCH 2024  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  "}'

A good layout can  improve the overall performance of the system and a  poor layout can result in stability issues and EMI  problems. The following guidelines are provided for  designing a power supply layout with the device.  • Place the input/output capacitors and the inductor as  close as possible to the IC pins and keep the power  traces short. Use direct and wide traces for routing  power paths to assure low trace parasitic resistance  and inductance.   • Connect the ground returns of the input and output  capacitors close to the GND pin and at the same point  to avoid a ground potential shift and to minimize high  frequency current path.   • Keep the output voltage sense trace and FB pin  connections away from the high frequency and noisy  conductors such as power traces and SW node to  avoid magnetic and electric noise coupling.   • Use GND planes in mid-layers for shielding and  minimizing the ground potential drifts.
