It can provide  high efficiency and low component count solution for 1-cell to  4-cell batteries charging applications.  The system is regulated slightly to be higher than the battery  voltage, but not lower than the programmable system  minimum voltage. Therefore, the system power is maintained  even if the battery is completely depleted or removed.  Dynamic power management (DPM) feature is also included  that automatically reduces the charge current if the input  current or voltage limit is reached. If the system load  continues to increase after reduction of charge current down  to zero, the battery enters the supplement mode and both  adapter and battery power the system.  A wide range of input sources are supported for SGM41570,  including traditional adapters, USB adapter and high voltage  USB PD sources. The converter is configured as Buck, Boost  or Buck-Boost during power-up, depending on the input  source and battery conditions. The charger automatically  switches among Buck, Boost and Buck-Boost without host  control.  When the input source is absent, the SGM41570 can work in  USB On-The-Go (OTG) mode to supply VBUS from battery.  The OTG output voltage can be programmed from 3V to  20.56V with 8mV resolution. The slew rate of the output  voltage transitions in OTG can be configured (by OTG current  setting) to comply with the USB PD 3.0 PPS specifications.  If there is no external load on the USB OTG port and the  system is powered by battery-only, the VMIN Active Protection  (VAP) feature is supported. In VAP, the VBUS voltage is  charged up by the battery and the energy is stored in the  input decoupling capacitors. When the system requires peak  power spike, the charge stored on the input capacitor  discharges to maintain the system voltage at minimum  system voltage.  Adapter current, battery current and system power are  monitored in SGM41570. When the system power is too high  and exceeds available power from adapter and battery  together, a flexibly programmed nPROCHOT pulse is  asserted to inform CPU for throttle back.
