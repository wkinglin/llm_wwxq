The VOUT rise time  can be programmed by setting an additional capacitor  to the SS pin, which can minimize inrush current. The  devices contain an N-MOSFET that can operate over  an input voltage range of 4.5V to 22V. With precision 5%  current limit, the devices can provide excellent  accuracy and be well applied to many system  protection applications.  Programmable under-voltage lockout or over-voltage  protection is used to turn off the device if the VIN drops  below or raises over a threshold value, 3% threshold  accuracy ensures tight that the downstream circuitry is  not damaged by unintended power supply. Fault  conditions are indicated by the nFLT pin.  The SGM2531 and SGM2531A are available in Green  SOIC-8 (Exposed Pad) and TDFN-2×3-8BL packages.      "}'

To reduce voltage drop for low  voltage and high current rails, the device implements a  low on-resistance N-MOSFET which reduces the  dropout voltage across the device.  The configurable rise time of the device greatly reduces  inrush current caused by large bulk load capacitances  or hot-plug boards, thereby reducing or eliminating  power supply drop. The current limit threshold can be  programmed between 0.1A and 3A through an external  resistor.  When the output load exceeds the current limit  threshold or a short-circuit event is present, the device  limits the output current to a safe level by increasing the  on-resistance of the power switch. Continuous heavy  overloads and short-circuits that increase power  dissipation of the switch can cause the junction  temperature to rise, in which case thermal protection  circuit will shut off the switch to prevent damage.   The device starts its operation by monitoring the VIN  bus. When VIN exceeds the under-voltage lockout  threshold, the device samples the ENUV pin. A high  level on this pin enables the internal N-MOSFET. When  VIN exceeds UVLO threshold and VENUV exceeds 1.39V,  the internal N-MOSFET of the device starts conducting  and allows current to flow from IN to OUT. When VENUV  is held low (below VENF), internal N-MOSFET is turned  off. When the voltage of OVP pin is more than VOVPR,  the internal N-MOSFET is turned off and protects the  downstream load. The device also features a fault flag  output (nFLT) pin to monitor system status and control  downstream load. The device has a thermal protection  feature to protect itself against thermal damage due to  over-temperature.     Adjustable Enable and Under-Voltage  Lockout (UVLO)  The ENUV pin controls the state of the switch. In its  high state, the internal N-MOSFET is enabled. A low  level on this pin turns off the internal N-MOSFET. High  and low levels are specified in the electrical  characteristics of the datasheet.  It is recommended to add an external bypass capacitor  between ENUV and GND pins to avoid the noise of  instability power or probabilistic power failure. The  ENUV falling edge deglitch delay is 1μs (TYP).  As an under-voltage lockout pin, the UVLO threshold is  programmed by an external resistor divider, as shown  in Figure 6.   Once the input rail under-voltage, the N-MOSFET will  be turned off quickly. If this function is not needed,  connect the ENUV pin to the VIN rail to avoid it happens.  Do not leave the ENUV pin floating.  The device implements the input UVLO and sets two  UVLOs in combination with ENUV. If VIN < VUVF, the  device is disabled and ENUV can set the VIN rise  threshold, so the device can set the section active  voltage to avoid the input rail fluctuation.

ENUV and Input OVP Set by R1, R2 and R3    Input Rail Over-Voltage Protection (OVP)  The SGM2531 family features over-voltage protection  function. The over-voltage threshold is programmed by  the resistor divider from the power supply to the OVP  terminal and to GND, as shown in Figure 6. If the  voltage of OVP pin is higher than VOVPR, the device  turns off the internal N-MOSFET. If not used, connect  this pin to GND.              SGM2531/SGM2531A  Programmable Current Limit Switches      12  JANUARY 2023    SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued)  Hot-Plug and Inrush Current Restrict  In the use of hot-plug boards, the surge current limits  the voltage drop of the backplane power supply voltage  and will lead to the unintended resets of the system  power supply. The capacitor between SS and GND pins  will set the slew rate according to the application  requirements.  An  approximate  formula  for  the  relationship between CSS and slew rate is shown in  Equation 1:    = × SS OUT SS SS C dV I GAIN dt               (1)  where:  ISS = 1μA (TYP)  dVOUT/dt = Target output slew rate  GAINSS = ΔVOUT/ΔVSS = 5.06    SS GND nSWEN 350Ω CINT 1μA SGM2531 CSS     Figure 7. Output Ramp Time (tSS) is Set by CSS    Equation 2 shows how to calculate the total output  ramp time (tSS) when the output rises from 0V to VIN:  tSS = 19.5 × 104 × VIN × CSS         (2)  where CSS is in F.    The inrush current (IINRUSH) can be calculated as:  = × IN INRUSH OUT SS V I C t               (3)   Rise time can be calculated by multiplying the input  voltage by the slew rate. If floating this pin, the slew  rate of the output obtains a default value ~50V/ms  (minimum tSS).    Over-Current and Short-Circuit Protections  The device limits current to the output in case of output  shorts and overloads. If an event occurs, device goes  into current limit action, and the value of the current  limit (ILIMIT) is set by RILIM resistor:  ILIMIT = 10.3 × 10-3 × RILIM + 0.017      (4)  LIMIT ILIM -3 I  -  0.017 R    10.3   10 = ×              (5)   where:  ILIMIT is the value of overload current limit in A.  RILIM is the current limit programming resistor in kΩ.  In addition to the general over-current protection, the  SGM2531 family also integrates fast-trip over-current  protection with quicker response time.     Overload Protection  When the output load exceeds the current limit  threshold, the internal current limit amplifier limits the  output current to the predetermined value by increasing  the  on-resistance of the  power switch. When  continuous heavy overloads increase the power  dissipation in the switch, causing the junction  temperature reach the thermal shutdown threshold, the  internal N-MOSFET is turned off. The fault pin (nFLT) is  asserted and will be pulled low to indicate a fault until  the thermal shutdown condition is released.                 SGM2531/SGM2531A  Programmable Current Limit Switches      13  JANUARY 2023    SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued)  Short-Circuit Protection  A transient short-circuit occurs, due to the limited  bandwidth of the current limit amplifier, which cannot  respond quickly to this event. The SGM2531 family  contains a fast-trip comparator with a threshold  (IFAST-TRIP). If IOUT > IFAST-TRIP, the comparator turns off  the N-MOSFET and terminates the short-circuit peak  current across the N-MOSFET rapidly. The fast-trip  threshold is 1.65 times the overload current limit. The  fast-trip comparator can terminate the transient  short-circuit peak current, and then the current limit  function limits the output current to ILIMIT.  IFAST-TRIP = 1.65 × ILIMIT           (6)  The IFAST-TRIP is fast-trip current limit. To prevent the  input voltage spike from damaging the device, a Zener  diode should be added. If the switching voltage of  SGM2531 family is more than 15V, the diode no more  than 22V (> 0.5W) is needed, as shown in Figure 6.    Startup with Output Shorted  For systems with short-circuit during startup, the  current is limited to ILIMIT. When the power dissipation of  the MOSFET is greater than 15W, it will be limited to  15W, and the ILIMIT will be decreased. After this, power  dissipation will lead to device thermal protection.    IN, OUT and GND Pins  To limit the voltage drop on the input supply caused by  transient inrush current when the switch turns on into a  discharged load capacitor, a capacitor needs to be  placed between IN and GND pins. Use a bypass  capacitor as close as possible between IN and GND  pins. Due to the integrated body diode in the  N-MOSFET, a CIN greater than COUT is highly  recommended. When the system power supply is  removed, COUT greater than CIN will cause VOUT to  exceed VIN.  This will result in current flow through the body diode  from VOUT to VIN. A CIN to COUT ratio of 10 to 1 is  recommended for minimizing VIN dip caused by inrush  currents during startup. In the on-state condition, VOUT  can be calculated using the Equation 7:  VOUT = VIN - (RDSON × IOUT)            (7)  where  RDSON  is  the  on-resistance  of  internal  N-MOSFET.  Fault Response  The SGM2531 family has a fault output signal to  indicate the operation state of the device. When any of  over-voltage, over-current or thermal shutdown occurs,  the nFLT pin is pulled low. The nFLT pin is open-drain  output which can be connected to OUT or another  external voltage through an external pull-up resistor. If  not used, leave it floating or connect to GND.    Thermal Shutdown (TSD)  Thermal shutdown protects the device from excessive  temperature. Once the device is shut down due to TSD  fault, it would either stay latch-off (SGM2531) or restart  automatically after TJ drops below [TTSD - 20 ℃]  (SGM2531A).    Shutdown Control  The device has a built-in over-temperature shutdown  circuitry designed to protect the internal N-MOSFETs if  the junction temperature exceeds TTSD. The internal  N-MOSFET can be remotely turned off by taking the  ENUV pin below its 1.34V threshold as shown in Figure  8. Upon releasing the ENUV pin, the device turns on  with soft-start cycle.

If TJ > TTSD, the device is shut down.  Over-Current  Response  Current is limited to ILIMIT level.  Power dissipation increases as (VIN - VOUT)  increases. When the power dissipation exceeds  15W, it will be limited to 15W.  TJ > TTSD, the device is turned off.  The SGM2531A will attempt restart tTSD_DLY after TJ <  [TTSD - 20℃].  Short-Circuit  Response  Fast turn-off when ILOAD > IFAST-TRIP.  According to the standard startup cycle, fast refresh  and limit the current to ILIMIT.          Smart Load Switch  The SGM2531 family can be used as a smart power  switch with wide input voltage range from 4.5V to 22V.  The  devices  provide  soft-start,  current  limit,  over-temperature protection, a fault indicate, and over-  or under-voltage lockout.  Figure 9 shows the typical implementation and usage  as load switch. It is recommended to add a  freewheeling diode across the load when load is highly  inductive.
