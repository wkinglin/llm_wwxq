The device provides  low insertion loss and high isolation performance.  These specifications make the device appropriate for  2G/3G/4G/5G applications, which need high power  processing and high linearity.  The device has the ability to integrate serial control  system compatible with RFFE standard. Internal driver  and decoder for switch control signals are offered by  the controller, which makes it flexible in RF path routing  and bands selection.  No external DC blocking capacitors required on the RF  paths as long as no external DC voltage is applied,  which can save PCB area and cost.  The SGM12024A is available in a Green UTQFN-2× 2-16AL package.    "}'

ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION  This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are  not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all  integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions.  Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures  can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle  performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision  integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage  because even small parametric changes could cause the  device not to meet the published specifications.

In order to ensure the correct data transmission,  SDA/SCL must be sent after VIO has been applied at  least 120ns. There must be at least 15μs to apply RF  power after VIO has been applied. Wait a minimum of  typically 10μs after RFFE bus is idle to apply an RF  signal (see Figure 5).   Do not apply RF power during switching. To ensure this,  the RF power needs to be removed before the register  write operation that changes the switching mode is  completed (see Figure 6).   When the low power mode is used, a delay time of 10μs  is required to exit the low power mode (see Figure 7).             Figure 4. Digital Supply Detail  Figure 5.
