The  input range of the ADC is 0V to VREF or 0V to 2 × VREF.  The ADC has a total throughput rate of 250kSPS.  The SGM51242R2, SGM51242R4, and SGM51242R8  have an integrated 2.5V, 10ppm/℃ (TYP) reference,  which is turned off by default, and an integrated  temperature sensor, which gives an indication of the die  temperature. The temperature value is read back as  part of an ADC read sequence.  The  SGM51242R2  is  available  in  a  Green  TQFN-3×3-16BL. The SGM51242R4 and SGM51242R8  are available in Green TQFN-3×3-16BL and TSSOP-16  packages. They operate over an ambient temperature  range of -40℃ to +125℃.    "}'

The function of each pin is determined by  programming the ADC configuration registers appropriately.  See the Configuring the SGM51242R2/SGM51242R4/  SGM51242R8 section and Table 3 for more information.     ADC Section  The device works as a multi-channel ADC, it works as same  as a traditional multi-channel ADC with a multiplexer  switching the inputs. The input channels are selected by  setting the ADC sequence register. The sequencer switches  the multiplexer to the next selected channel in ascending  sequence automatically. Once the ADC sequence register  setting is completed, the sequencer switches to the first  selected channel and keeps in track mode. The first falling  edge of nSYNC in the following operation frame stops the  current sampling section and begins the conversion of the  current channel, and the sequencer switches to the next  selected channel and keeps in track mode. The nSYNC  falling edge of the next operation frame starts the second  channel conversion and clocks the first channel ADC result  out.  The ADC conversion result is in 16-bit format, please refer to  Table 1.  The ADC is a fast, 12-bit, unipolar power supply, SAR ADC.  Each conversion takes 2μs. The ADC input range can be  configured as 0V to VREF or 0V to 2 × VREF. All ADC channels  share the same input range. The ADC input range is set by bit  D5 in the ADC control register (refer to Table 4). The ADC  output code is straight binary format.    Internal Reference  The SGM51242R2, SGM51242R4, and SGM51242R8 have  an on-chip 2.5V reference, which is powered off by default  when the chip is powered up. To enable the internal reference,  the bit D9 is set in the power-down and reference control  register (refer to Table 8).    Temperature Sensor  The SGM51242R2, SGM51242R4, and SGM51242R8 have  an integrated temperature sensor that can be used to  estimate the temperature of die. The temperature conversion  time is about 1μs, no matter auxiliary buffer is enabled or not.  To enable the temperature sampling, set the bit D8 in the  ADC sequence register (refer to Table 6). The temperature  result data is in address of 0b1000.  Calculation of the temperature is shown below:   When ADC gain = 1:     ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) REF REF ADC Code - 0.56/V    4095 Temperature  = 25 +  3.015   2.5/V × × ℃ (1)  When ADC gain = 2:  ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) REF REF ADC Code - 0.56/(2   V    4095 Temperature  = 25 +  1.508   2.5/V × × × ） ℃ (2)  The codes range returned by the ADC is approximately 721 to  1219, and its temperature range is from -40℃ to +125℃.     Serial Interface  The SGM51242R2, SGM51242R4, and SGM51242R8 have  an SPI-compatible interface. Please refer to Table 2 for the  input shift register in 16-bit format. The most significant bit  (MSB) D15 must be '0'. The means of each bit is shown in  Table 2.  Table 3 lists the control registers map, which allows all the  input pins to be configured and ADC channels to be included  in sampling sequences.    Table 1.

D[14:11] is the control register address (see Table 2).      Power-Up Time  After the power supply is powered on, it will take  SGM51242R2/SGM51242R4/SGM51242R8 about 250μs to  initial the internal circuit blocks and load the registers with the  default values. Any operation during this time is restricted.    Write Mode  Figure 1 shows the read and write timing for the device. A  falling edge of nSYNC starts a write frame. Data is locked on  the falling edge of SCLK. After 16 falling edges of SCLK, all  16-bit data is shifted in. Then nSYNC can be pulled high.     Read Mode  The SGM51242R2, SGM51242R4, and SGM51242R8  support both ADC conversion data read and the register data  read. During the normal operation, the ADC conversion result  automatically is shifted out a part of a sequence. Reading a  register needs the following steps. First issue a write frame to  the readback mode register to select the register to read out.  The second step is that issue a 16 SCLKs operating frame,  and the data in the selected register is shifted out.     Configuring the SGM51242R2/SGM51242R4/  SGM51242R8  The SGM51242R2/SGM51242R4/SGM51242R8 input pins  are software configurable. The control registers are listed in  Table 3.  After the chip is powered up, all input pins are pulled down to  GND by 85kΩ resistors by default. A command 0x00 to  address 0b0110 can disable the pull-down resistor.

More details  please refer to Table 4.    ADC Operation  The SGM51242R2, SGM51242R4, and SGM51242R8 are  the traditional multi-channel ADCs which are composed of a  multiplexer and one ADC core. Each nSYNC operation frame  gives out previous channel conversion result and initiates the  next conversion.   The ADC converts all selected channels in ascending order.  The input channels are enabled in ADC sequence register. If  REP bit in the ADC sequence register is set, once ADC  finishes all selected channels, it will repeat the sequence. If  REP bit is not set, once ADC finished all selected channels, it  goes to 3-state.   The typical operating sequences of the SGM51242R2/  SGM51242R4/SGM51242R8 are shown in Figure 3 to Figure  6. The ADC conversion result data format is shown in Table 7.    Changing an ADC Sequence   To start a new sequence setting, the current ADC sequence  needs to be stopped first. Clearing REP, TEMP and ADC0 to  ADC7 bits in the ADC sequence register can stop the ADC  conversion sequence. The stop command cannot stop the  on-going conversion. A new setting cannot be started until the  current conversion is completed. A minimum 2μs is required  between a new setting and the end of current conversion.  After the new sequence setting command, it will take the ADC  at least 500ns to sample before starting the next conversion.    Table 4.

If none of the input channels  are enabled as ADCs, the chip is automatically powered  down. More details are shown in Table 8.    Reset Function  The SGM51242R2, SGM51242R4, and SGM51242R8  support software reset (refer to Table 9). The reset command  will reset all registers to the default values and reset all input  pins to their default conditions. It will take the chip 250μs to  complete the reset process. It is not recommended to do any  operation during this time.    Readback Mode Register  The SGM51242R2, SGM51242R4, and SGM51242R8  support the register readback function. It needs to be enabled  by setting bit D6 in readback mode register before performing  a register readback. Bits D[5:2] are used to select the address  of the register to be read back. After the first enable and  register selected data frame, then the data of the selected  register is shifted out in the next data frame. More details are  shown in Table 10.    Table 8.
