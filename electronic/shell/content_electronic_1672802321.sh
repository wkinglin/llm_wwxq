Two  devices can also be linked up as a master-slave  through an external pin to provide four single-phase  outputs or two dual-phase outputs. The switching  phases of linked devices are adjustable to achieve four  phases interleaving. The device accepts an input range  from 3V to 20V with a precise reference voltage of  0.6V.  The controllers employ fixed frequency voltage mode  PWM  regulation  scheme.  Separated  enable,  current-sense and PGOOD pins are incorporated to  allow soft-start times and current limits to be  programmable individually. The device offers individual  over-current,  output  over-voltage  and  output  under-voltage protections.    "}'

Block Diagram       Dual-Output or Two-Phase  SGM64200  Synchronous Buck Controller      12  DECEMBER 2022  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  DETAILED DESCRIPTION  The SGM64200 is a two-phase single output/two-way  output Buck controller. The input voltage range is 3V to  20V, and the minimum output voltage is 600mV.  In the case of two outputs, the controller is in voltage  control mode with input voltage feedforward. Its  advantage is that it is insensitive to noise, and there is  no control instability in DCR applications. Besides, it  has a small minimum on-time, which can produce lower  output voltage.  Under the condition of two-phase single output,  two-phase current sharing can be achieved, so as to  balance two-phase heating. Since the detected current  sharing error signal is relatively small, the whole loop  can be modeled according to the voltage mode with  feedforward.  When the device operates under two outputs, the  ROUT pin must leave floating.    Voltage Reference  The 600mV bandgap reference is connected to the  positive input end of the amplifier. This reference  voltage can be adjusted in a unity gain configuration,  thereby  eliminating  the  voltage  cheapness  in  applications. The reference voltage with a tolerance of  0.5% allows the customer to design a very precise  power supply.    Output Voltage Setting  The output voltage of SGM64200 is regulated by  external resistance, as shown in Figure 3. The  regulated voltage is obtained by Equation 1.  A OUT BIAS R V 0.6V 1 R   = × +               (1)    COMPx FBx AGND VOUTx + - VREF RA RBIAS     Figure 3. Setting the Output Voltage  Input Voltage Feedforward  By adding voltage feedforward, the SGM64200 keeps  the power stage gain constant when the input voltage  changes, and has a fast response to line transition. At  the same time, the simple power stage also simplifies  the loop design. From the model, the front-end gain  from COMP to LC is 8.5V/V.    Current Sensing  The SGM64200 uses differential current detection to  detect the output current. It can be DCR of the inductor  or precision current detection resistance, which should  be added separately. When DCR is used to detect  current in Figure 4, parallel RC filter is required to filter  out AC voltage component of inductor.    ISNS1+ ISNS1- VOUT1 VIN R1 L DCR L1 C1     Figure 4. Inductor DCR Current Sensing    Use Equation 2 to calculate R1 and C1 for an ideal  design.  1 1 1 L R C DCR × =                (2)  The RC time constant needs to be equal to the time  constant of the inductor itself. When their time  constants are the same, the voltage on C1 is equal to  the product of the current in the inductor and DCR. At  this time, it is generally recommended to select a  capacitor of 0.1µF as the value of C1.           Dual-Output or Two-Phase  SGM64200  Synchronous Buck Controller      13  DECEMBER 2022  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued)  Over-Current Protection  When the SGM64200 operates on two outputs, each  channel has an OCTH pin to monitor the current. When  operating in two-phase mode, the two channels set the  same over-current threshold through OCTH1. The  current detection method is to set the over-current  threshold voltage by connecting the resistance  between the OCTHx pin and AGND in series. The  detected current is amplified 15 times internally by the  amplifier, and then compare with the over-current  threshold to determine whether an over-current fault  occurs, as shown in Figure 5 below.    ISNS1+ ISNS1- SW1 IOUT R1 L DCR C1 VOUT1 + - + - OCTH1 10µA OC ACS =  15     Figure 5. Over-Current Protection    Use Equation 3 to calculate the current limit resistance  (ROCTH) of desired over-current limit.    RIPPLE OC CS OCTH OCTH I I DCR A 2 R I   + × ×     =         (3)  Where:  IOC is the desired DC over-current limit level.  IRIPPLE is the inductor peak-peak ripple current.  DCR is the inductor DC resistance.  ACS is 15 (TYP). It is the current sensing amplifier gain.  IOCTH is 10µA (TYP). It is the internal source current out  of OCTHx pin.  When the inductance current exceeds the set threshold,  the SGM64200 will limit the current cycle by cycle.  When three times of continuous over-current conditions  occur, the high-side MOSFET and low-side MOSFET  are turned off, and the controller starts to hiccup. The  chip will enter into restart mode after six soft-start  processes. When the over-current condition disappears,  it works normally, otherwise repeat the above  operation.    Two-Phase Mode, Remote Sense Amplifier,  and Current Sharing Loop  The SGM64200 can work in the high current two-phase  mode. When the appropriate external MOSFET is  selected, the system can output the current up to 50A.  As shown in Figure 6, when the configuration is in  two-phase mode, FB2 is connected to VDD6V, and  COMP1 and COMP2 are connected at the same time.  For applications with large current, the remote  compensation amplifier is used to compensate output  voltage drop, so as to adjust the remote voltage to the  set value. EN2/RGND and OCTH2 are multiplexing  pins, which are used as RSNS and RGND in two-phase  mode.  ROUT  is  the  output  terminal  of  the  compensation amplifier, which is connected to the  output voltage divider.

Under normal application, the set output  voltage must be 0.2V lower than the VDD6V voltage,  otherwise, it cannot be adjusted to a proper value. If the  output voltage is below 2.2V, the remote sense  amplifier can be used. If the output exceeds 2.2V, the  amplifier can be omitted, and the remote voltage is  directly connected to the resistance voltage divider  network.  When the device operates in two-phase mode, the  current sharing loop shown in Figure 7 is used to  balance two-phase current. The two phases have the  same COMP value. Compare to the current of the two  phases in the current sharing loop and generate an  error signal. The signal acts with the COMP signal to  generate their own error signals and compare them  with the slope to generate their own PWM pulses.        + COMP1 Current  Share + CLK1 CLK2 COMP2 FB1 VREF + - FB2 VREF + - PWM Logic PWM Logic VDD6V ISNS1+ ISNS1- VOUT R1 L DCR L1 + - SW1 C1 ISNS2+ ISNS2- R2 L DCR L2 + - SW2 C2 IO1 IO2     Figure 7.

When the voltage across the soft-start capacitor  exceeds 0.7V, the internal VDD6V linear regulator is  enabled. When the VIN, VDD6V, PG, and clock signals  are confirmed, ENx is pulled down to 0.4V by the  140µA current source and then charged by the internal  10µA current source. VSS_INT is the voltage of the shifted  soft-start capacitor, connected to the non-inverting  terminal end of the error amplifier.    0.4 0.8 1.3 VEN1 VSS_INT Voltage  (V) Time     Figure 8. EN Start-up Waveform    The external soft-start capacitor and the charge current  source determine the soft-start time together, which is  the actual output ramp rise time when the soft-start  capacitor is charged up by 600mV. Due to the offset  (800mV, TYP) from the actual ENx pin voltage to the  VSS_INT, there is some initial hysteresis. The soft-start  sequence occurs in a closed-loop fashion, which  means that the error amplifier continuously controls the  output voltage during soft-start. And the feedback loop  remains closed, as happens in a duty cycle limited  soft-start design. The error amplifier has two positive  inputs. One is connected to the 600mV reference while  the other is to VSS_INT. The error amplifier regulates the  output voltage to whichever the lower value. When the  voltage of the EN pin is raised to 1.4V, the 600mV  reference becomes the main input to the error amplifier,  and the converter has reached the final regulation  voltage. Use equation 4 to calculate the soft-start  capacitor, CSS.  SS SS SS t I C 600mV × =                (4)    Where:  tSS is the desired soft-start time,  ISS is 10µA (TYP). It is the internal soft-start current.    Prebiased Output Start-Up  The SGM64200 supports pre-biased startup. During  soft-start, it does not generate any PWM pulse until  VSS_INT exceeds the FB voltage. Once VSS_INT exceeds  the FB voltage, PWM pulses are initiated with very  short on-time of synchronous rectifier. The on-time is  then gradually increased cycle after cycle to meet the  duration determined by (1-D)/fSW where D is the duty  cycle. This scheme can prevent sinking of current from  the pre-biased output, and support a smooth and  controllable ramping of output voltage.  During a soft-start sequence, pulse skipping occurs  when the PWM pulse width is shorter than the minimum  controllable  on-time  (typically  caused  by  PWM  comparator and gate driver delays) and the output may  show a large ripple voltage.    Shutdown  VDD6V is controlled by EN during shutdown, and if the  EN pins of both channels are pulled low, VDD6V is  disabled regardless of whether the input voltage  exceeds the programmed UVLO.    Switching Frequency and Master or Slave  Synchronization  The switching frequency is determined by the  resistance of the FREQ pin connected to GND, as  Equation 5 follows.  9 FREQ SW 20 10 R f × =                (5)  Where:  RFREQ is the resistor from FREQ pin to AGND in Ω.  fSW is the desired switching frequency in Hz.

Figure 9 implements a method to reduce the ripple of  the input voltage by averaging the phase shift between  two SGM64200 devices.    Table 1.

Synchronization Diagram    Over-Voltage and Under-Voltage Fault  Protection  The SGM64200 achieves over-voltage/under-voltage  detection by sensing the voltage sampled by the FB pin.  The compensation network is connected to the FB pin  and the COMP pin affects the rate at which the output  voltage is sensed. The error amplifier attempts to adjust  the output to match the FB to the reference voltage,  and if the error amplifier is unable to do so, it triggers  over-voltage/under-voltage protection. Please refer to  the Electrical Characteristics for more details.  If under-voltage occurs, the device will enter into hiccup  mode and keep trying to restart until the fault is  recovered.  If over-voltage occurs, the device will shut down the  high-side MOSFET and lock the low-side MOSFET to  release the output current to the regulated level within  the power good window.  In the mode of two outputs, the fault of a single channel  does not affect the normal operation of the other, and  only the voltage value of the FB1 pin is detected in the  two-phase mode, so both channels will take action after  the fault is detected.

These pins are open-drain outputs, and  the PG pin is pulled low when the feedback voltage  (VFB) is not within ±12.5% from nominal or when the  soft-start function is active.    Thermal Shutdown  When the junction temperature of the device reaches  the thermal shutdown threshold of +150℃, the PWM  oscillator shuts down, then the high-side and low-side  drivers shut down.

At the maximum load current,  the inductance can be obtained by Equation 8.

Output Capacitor Selection (C10 through C16)  The selection of output capacitance needs to consider  the transient response. Equations 10 and 11 leave a  margin when estimating the voltage deviation, so as to  consider the response delay in the loop, and thus  determine the output capacitance:  ( ) OUT1 OVER1 OUT1 2 OUT1 1 OUT1 OUT1 OUT1 OUT1 OUT1 OUT1 Δl V Δt C Δl L Δl Δl L1 C V V C < × = × × × = ×       (10)  ( ) ( ) OUT1 UNDER1 OUT1 2 OUT1 1 OUT1 OUT1 OUT1 IN OUT1 IN OUT1 OUT1 Δl V Δt C Δl L Δl Δl L1 C V - V V - V C < × = × × × = ×      (11)  When VIN_MIN > 2 × VOUT1, use Equation VOVER1 to  calculate the minimum output capacitance. When  VIN_MIN < 2 × VOUT1, calculate the value using Equation  VUNDER1. In this design example, the VIN_MIN is much  larger than 2 × VOUT1, so Equation 12 is used for  calculation.

One of  them is the input loop with high-frequency AC  discontinuous current, and the other is the output loop  with high-frequency continuous current. In order to  make the input loop as small as possible, the input  ceramic capacitor should be as close to the main switch  mos and synchronous rectifier mos as possible. Like  the input loop, the output capacitor in the output loop  also needs to be closer to the inductor and PGND to  reduce the area of the output loop. The SW node needs  to be very small to reduce the radiation area. HS and  LS require short and thick trace to be placed between  the chip and mos.    Device Peripheral  SGM64200 needs to distinguish signal ground (AGND)  from power ground (PGND). It is necessary to correctly  distinguish the grounding in the circuit. All the pins  related to the power stage are connected to PGND, and  other pins related to the signal stage (such as FB1, FB2,  FREQ, OCTH1 and OCTH2) are connected to AGND.  When DCR is applied to detect current, Kelvin  connection is required. The detection capacitance  needs to be close to the ISNS+ and ISNS- pins. In  two-phase mode, OCTH2/RSN and EN2/RGND need  to be directly connected to the load point where the  voltage needs to be adjusted, and the leads need to be  wired in parallel and away from the switching elements.
