It implements  peak current mode control to simplify external  compensation design.  With a wide input voltage range of 3.8V to 55V, it is  suitable for a broad range of applications such as  industry equipment.  The SGM6060 operates at fixed frequency and enters  PFM (Pulse Frequency Modulation) mode automatically  at light loads to maintain high efficiency. During startup  and thermal shutdown, the frequency foldback  technique is used to avoid inductor current runaway for  reliable and fault tolerant operation. The current limit  foldback technique is used for reducing power  consumption during output shorted and suppressing  output voltage overshot during recovery.  Switching frequency can be set as high as 2MHz. It  minimizes the EMI noise issues that could interfere with  nearby systems such as AM radio or ADSL modems.  The SGM6060 is available in Green TDFN-3×3-10L  and SOIC-8 (Exposed Pad) packages.    "}'

It is a perfect solution for efficient single  stage Buck applications. The integrated functions  include  precision  current  limiting,  automatically  switched PWM and PFM modes, soft-start circuit and  wide range switching frequency, which can meet  different requirements. Peak current mode control is  implemented to provide fast load transient response  and simple compensation.    VIN Under-Voltage Lockout (UVLO)  The SGM6060 integrates VIN under-voltage lockout  (UVLO)  feature  to  protect  the  device  from  malfunctioning when the input voltage is insufficient to  properly power up the internal circuits. The UVLO rising  threshold is 3.16V (TYP) and has a 0.61V (TYP)  hysteresis.  Internal 2.8V Regulator  An internal 2.8V regulator powers most of the device  internal circuits. The 2.8V output is fully regulated when  VIN exceeds 3.16V. It will drop if VIN falls below 3.16V.    Enable Input  The EN pin is an active high input to enable or disable  the device. The EN rising threshold voltage VENR is  1.58V (TYP) and has a 460mV (TYP) hysteresis.  A 1μA internal current source pulls the EN pin up to  approximately 3.0V. Therefore the device will be  enabled when the EN pin is left floating. To disable the  device, pull the EN pin down below 1.12V with at least  1µA sink capability.  When VEN falls below 1.12V, the device is disabled and  enters low shutdown current mode. When VEN exceeds  0V and does not reach VENR, the device is still disabled  but with slightly higher shutdown current.

First, the bandgap  circuit starts working to generate stable reference  voltage and bias current. Then two internal regulators  are established to provide supply voltage for internal  analog and digital circuit respectively. About 30µs later,  bootstrap capacitor voltage is charged above UVLO  threshold. Then the output starts to rise slowly during  soft-start.  The device is disabled when any of invalid EN voltage,  VIN UVLO and thermal shutdown events occurs. Once  the device is disabled, the high-side switch is turned off  immediately to avoid any other fault triggering.    Soft-Start and Ramp  Every time the device is enabled (after power-up,  pulling EN high), the output voltage is gradually  increased to its regulation value with a ramp (after a  brief 50µs hold). Soft-start is needed to prevent  triggering of current limit or short-circuit protections or  to avoid output overshooting during startup. Without a  soft-start, the inrush currents of the output capacitors or  the load can cause over-current and the protection  procedure results in non-monotonic startup or even  instability. Overshooting may also occur during startup  after short-circuit recovery. The internal soft-start  voltage (VSS) and reference (VREF) are both sent to the  error amplifier and the lower value of them is the actual  reference that is compared with the feedback voltage  (VFB).    PWM Operation Mode  In the moderate to heavy load conditions, the  SGM6060 runs at fixed frequency with peak current  control mode. The high-side MOSFET is turned on at  the leading edge of internal clock until the sensing  current ramp signal reaches the COMP voltage. If the  switch current does not reach the reference value  (conversion from VC) in a cycle, the switch will also be  turned off for tOFF_MIN (100ns, TYP) before the next  clock.    PFM Mode  In the light load condition, the frequency is reduced  depending on the load to minimize the switching and  gate driving losses and keep the efficiency high.  PWM Comparator and Current Limit  For peak current mode, a signal represent of high-side  current is used as the input of PWM comparator, which  is accurately sampled by internal sensing circuit. After  100ns typical blanking time, the signal is compared with  COMP to determine switching state of high-side  MOSFET. The cycle-by-cycle current limit threshold is  approximately 3.79A.  Note that the measured peak current limits in the  closed-loop and open-loop test conditions are slightly  different, mainly caused by the propagation delay.    Short-Circuit Protection and Recovery  If the output is shorted to the ground, the switching  frequency is reduced. The foldback current limit is  reduced by half to lower the power consumption.  During output shorted condition, VSS is pulled down to  about 0.1V above VFB to reduce the overshot of short  recovery. The current limit resumes its normal value  when VFB exceeds 0.4V.    Bootstrap Floating MOSFET Driver  The power of the high-side MOSFET driver is provided  by an external capacitor between BOOT and SW pins.  An internal bootstrap regulator keeps the bootstrap  capacitor charged and regulated to approximately 4.5V.  The bootstrap voltage is detected by internal BOOT  UVLO circuit with 2.4V rising threshold and 250mV  hysteresis. If the bootstrap voltage falls below its UVLO  threshold, the power MOSFET is turned off immediately.  An internal transistor is used to pull down the SW node  to make sure BOOT capacitor is charged sufficiently.  This design can obviously reduce the output voltage  ripple at small input/output voltage difference and no  load. When the bootstrap voltage is charged above  threshold, the pull-down transistor is turned off and  high-side MOSFET is able to be turned on again.  Except for BOOT UVLO condition, the external circuit  connected to the SW serves as the return path to GND  for the charge current. Enough voltage headroom  should be left to facilitate the charging. When the  external freewheeling diode is on, bootstrap charging  starts until the regulated voltage.         SGM6060  55V, 2A High Frequency Buck Converter      10  DECEMBER 2022  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued)  The converter operates in PFM Mode at no load or light  load, to minimize switching losses and keep the output  regulated. In this mode, the available time for  refreshing the BOOT voltage is reduced, bootstrap  voltage will drop below the regulated voltage (4.5V).  The maximum charged voltage is equal to VIN - VOUT. If  the difference of VIN - VOUT is too small, BOOT UVLO  can be triggered. The internal charging circuit charges  the bootstrap capacitor by the set frequency, until  BOOT UVLO is released.  The designer should make sure that the SW node  bleeding current is higher than the quiescent current of  the floating driver (approximately 20µA). Usually the  feedback resistors (R1 and R2) are selected such that  the R1 + R2 value is small enough to provide that  current:  + > + OUT OUT _MIN 1 2 V I 20μA (R R )           (1)    External Bootstrap Diode  To improve the efficiency, using an external boot diode  supplied from a 5V rail (in Figure 3) is recommended in  the following cases:   A 5V rail is available.   VIN is less than 5V.   VOUT is between 3.3V and 5V.   High duty cycle applications (VOUT/VIN > 65%).  A low-cost diode like IN4148 or BAT54 can be used.  BOOT SW SGM6060 0.1μF 5V   Figure 3. External Bootstrap Diode    Adjustable Switching Frequency  The switching frequency is adjusted by connecting an  external resistor (R4) between the FREQ and GND.  Use Equation 2 to calculate R4 resistance:  SW 4 94581 7.24 f (kHz) R (kΩ) - =            (2)  For Example, to get 500kHz switching frequency, the  required R4 resistor is 180kΩ.  An internal frequency foldback technique is designed  by monitoring the FB voltage. It can effectively avoid  the inductor current runaway during startup or  restarting in certain situation.    Error Amplifier (EA)  The output voltage is sensed by a resistor divider  through the FB pin and is compared with the internal  reference. The EA generates an output current that is  proportional to the voltage difference (error). This  current is fed into the external compensation network to  generate the VC voltage on the COMP pin, which sets  the reference value for the peak current that controls  the on time of the power MOSFET.  The operating voltage range of COMP (VC) is between  0.75V and 2.0V in normal conditions. COMP is pulled  down to the ground when the device shuts down. The  COMP voltage must not be pulled higher than 2.8V.    Thermal Shutdown  To protect the device from damage due to overheating,  a thermal shutdown feature is implemented to disable  the device when the die temperature exceeds +155℃ (TYP). The chip is automatically enabled when the  temperature falls below +135℃ (20℃ hysteresis, TYP).

SGM6060 Application Example with 3.3V/2A Output    Design Requirements  In this example, a high frequency regulator with  ceramic output capacitors will be designed using  SGM6060 and the details will be reviewed. The design  requirements are typically determined at the system  level. The known requirements are summarized in  Table 1.  Table 1. Design Parameters  Design Parameter  Example Value  Output Voltage  3.3V  Maximum Output Current  2A  Load Transient Response of 1A - 2A Step  ΔVOUT = 7%  Input Voltage Range  12V nominal, 8V to 55V  Maximum Output Voltage Ripple  33mVP-P  Turn-On Input Voltage (Rising VIN)  7.9V  Turn-Off Input Voltage (Falling VIN)  5.6V  Switching Frequency (fSW)  500kHz    Operating Frequency  Usually the first parameter to design is the switching  frequency (fSW). Higher switching frequencies allow  smaller solution size and smaller filter inductors and  capacitors, and the bandwidth of the converter can be  increased for faster response. It is also easier to filter  noises because they also shift to higher frequencies.  The drawbacks are increased switching and gate  driving losses that result in lower efficiency and tighter  thermal limits. Also the duty cycle range and step-down  ratio will be limited due to the minimum on time and/or  off time limits of the converter. In this design, fSW =  500kHz is chosen as a tradeoff. From Equation 2, the  nearest standard resistor for this frequency is R4 =  180kΩ.  Inductor Design  Equation 3 is conventionally used to calculate the  output inductance of a Buck converter. Generally, a  smaller inductor is preferred to allow larger bandwidth  and smaller size. The ratio of inductor current ripple (∆IL)  to the maximum output current (IOUT) is represented as  KIND factor (∆IL/IOUT). The inductor ripple current is  bypassed and filtered by the output capacitor and the  inductor DC current is passed to the output. Inductor  ripple is selected based on a few considerations. The  peak inductor current (IOUT + ∆IL/2) must have a safe  margin from the saturation current of the inductor in the  worst-case conditions especially if a hard-saturation  core type inductor (such as ferrite) is chosen. During  power-up with large output capacitor, over-current,  output shorted or load transient conditions, the actual  peak current of inductor can be greater than ILPEAK  calculated in Equation 6. For peak current mode  converter, selecting an inductor with saturation current  above the switch current limit is sufficient. Typically, a  20% to 40% ripple is selected (KIND = 0.2 ~ 0.4).  Choosing a higher KIND value reduces the selected  inductance.  × × × INMAX OUT OUT 1 OUT IND INMAX SW    = V - V V L I K V f       (3)           SGM6060  55V, 2A High Frequency Buck Converter      12  DECEMBER 2022  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued)  In this example, KIND = 0.3 is chosen and the  inductance is calculated to be 10.34μH. In this example,  the nearest standard value 10μH is selected. The ripple,  RMS and peak inductors current calculations are  summarized in Equations 4, 5 and 6 respectively.

A  10μH inductor from Sunlord SWPA8040S100MT with  4.1A saturation and 3.3A RMS current ratings is selected.  External Diode (D)  The SGM6060 adopts non-synchronous architecture.  Therefore an external diode is required to place  between SW and GND pins. A Schottky diode is  recommended due to the characteristics of fast  recovery and small forward conduction voltage drop,  which can help improve the efficiency and reduce the  rising edge ring of SW node.  For main parameters of diode, the maximum reverse  voltage rating of the selected diode must be greater  than the maximum applicable input voltage. The peak  current rating must be greater than the current limit,  and the average forward current should be greater than  typical load current with enough margin.  In this example, a B380-13-F from Diodes Inc. with 80V  reverse voltage and 3A forward current is selected.  Output Capacitor Design  Three primary criteria must be considered for design of  the output capacitor (COUT): (1) the converter pole  location, (2) the output voltage ripple, (3) the transient  response to a large change in load current. The  selected value must satisfy all of them. The desired  transient response is usually expressed as maximum  overshoot, maximum undershoot, or maximum recovery  time of VOUT in response to a large load step. Transient  response is usually the more stringent criteria in low  output voltage applications. The output capacitor must  provide the increased load current or absorb the  excess inductor current (when the load current steps  down) until the control loop can re-adjust the current of  the inductor to the new load level. Typically, it requires  two or more cycles for the loop to detect the output  change and respond (change the duty cycle). It may  also be expressed as the maximum output voltage drop  or rise when the full load is connected or disconnected  (100% load step). Equation 7 can be used to calculate  the minimum output capacitance that is needed to  supply or absorb a current step (ΔIOUT) for at least 2  cycles until the control loop responds to the load  change with a maximum allowed output transient of  ΔVOUT (overshoot or undershoot).  OUT OUT SW OUT 2 I C f  >  V × ∆ × ∆                (7)  For example, if the acceptable transient to a 1A load  step is 7%, by inserting ΔVOUT = 0.07 × 3.3V = 0.231V  and ΔIOUT = 1A, the minimum required capacitance will  be 17.3μF. Generally, the ESR of ceramic capacitors is  small enough. The impact of output capacitor ESR on  the transient is not taken into account in Equation 7.  Equation 8 can be used for the output ripple criteria and  finding the minimum output capacitance needed.  VORIPPLE is the maximum acceptable ripple. In this  example, the allowed ripple is 33mV that results in  minimum capacitance of 4.7μF.  OUT SW ORIPPLE I   8 >  1 C f V ∆ × × L             (8)  Note that the impact of output capacitor ESR on the  ripple is not considered in Equation 8. Use Equation 9  to calculate the maximum acceptable ESR of the output  capacitor to meet the output voltage ripple requirement.  In this example, the ESR must be less than  33mV/0.62A = 53.2mΩ.  ORIPPLE ESR V R I < ∆L               (9)  Higher nominal capacitance value must be chosen due  to aging, temperature, and DC bias derating of the  output capacitors. In this example, a 22μF/25V ceramic  capacitor with X7R dielectric and 3mΩ ESR is selected.  There is a limit to the amount of ripple current that a  capacitor can handle without damage or overheating.  The inductor ripple is bypassed through the output  capacitor. Equation 10 calculates the RMS current that  the output capacitor must support. In this example, it is  179mA.

If input power is far away from  SGM6060, additional bulk capacitor is recommended in  parallel to stabilize input voltage. The RMS value of  input capacitor can be calculated from Equation 11 and  the maximum ICIRMS occurs at 50% duty cycle. For this  example, the maximum input RMS current is 1A. The  ripple current rating of input capacitor should be greater  than ICIRMS.  ( ) CIRMS OUTMAX I I D 1-D = × ×          (11)  where D is the duty cycle.  In this example, the voltage rating of capacitor should  have a safe margin from maximum input voltage.  Therefore, a 10μF/100V ceramic capacitor is selected  for VIN to cover all DC bias, thermal and aging  deratings, and two 0.1μF/100V capacitors are selected  for further decoupling of high frequency noise. The  small capacitors should be connected between VIN and  GND pins as close as possible.  The input voltage ripple can be calculated from  Equation 12, and the maximum ripple occurs at 50%  duty cycle.  ( ) OUTMAX IN IN SW I D 1-D V C f × × D = ×           (12)  Bootstrap Capacitor Selection  A 0.1μF ceramic capacitor with 10V or higher voltage  rating must be connected between the BOOT and SW  pin. X5R or better dielectric types are recommended.  UVLO Setting  The under-voltage lockout (UVLO) can be programmed  by an external voltage divider network. In this design,  the turn-on (enable to start switching) occurs when VIN  rises above 7.9V (VSTARTUP). When the regulator is in  operation, it will not stop switching (disabled) until the  input falls below 5.6V (VSHUTDOWN). Use Equation 13 to  calculate the resistors value. In this example, choose  R5 = 100kΩ and R6 = 24.9kΩ.  STARTUP ENR 5 6 ENR V - V R R V = ×           (13)  Feedback Resistors  Choosing a 100kΩ value for the upper resistor (R1), the  lower resistor (R2) can be calculated from Equation 14.  The nearest 1% resistor for the calculated value (32kΩ)  is 32.4kΩ. For higher output accuracy, choose resistors  with better tolerance (0.5% or better).  REF 2 1 OUT REF V R R V - V = ×           (14)  Loop Compensation Design  Several techniques are used by engineers to  compensate a DC/DC regulator. In this simplified  method, the effects of the slope compensation are  ignored. Because of this approximation, the actual  cross over frequency is usually lower than the  calculated value.  First, the converter pole (fP), and ESR zero (fZ) are  calculated from Equations 15 and 16. For COUT, the  worst derated value of 17μF should be used. Equations  17 and 18 can be used to find an estimation for  closed-loop crossover frequency (fCO) as a starting  point (choose the lower value).

Equation 17 yields 133.1kHz for crossover frequency  and Equation 18 gives 37.7kHz. As the influence of  slope compensation in the actual circuit, a slightly  higher frequency of 40kHz is selected.

P 3 6 1 f 2 R C = × × π                (21)  Layout Considerations  PCB layout is critical for stable and high-performance  converter operation. The recommend layout is shown in  Figure 5.   Place the nearest input high frequency decoupling  capacitor (0.1μF) between VIN and GND pins as  close as possible.   Place the larger input ceramic capacitor and  Schottky diode close to relevant pins for minimizing  the influence of ground bounce.   Use short and wide trace to connect SW node to the  inductor. Minimize the area of switching loop.  Otherwise, large voltage spikes on the SW node and  poor EMI performance are inevitable.   Sensitive signal like FB, COMP, EN traces must be  placed away from high dv/dt nodes (such as SW)  and not inside any high di/dt loop (like capacitor or  switch loops). The ground of these signals should be  connected to GND pin and separated with power  ground.   To improve the thermal relief, use a group of thermal  vias under the exposed pad to transfer the heat to  the ground planes in the opposite side of the PCB.  Use small vias (approximately 15mil) such that they  can be filled up during the reflow soldering process to  provide a good metallic heat conduction path from  the IC exposed pad to the other PCB side.   Connect VIN, GND and exposed pad pins to large  copper areas to increase heat dissipation and  long-term reliability. Keep SW area small to avoid  emission issue.
