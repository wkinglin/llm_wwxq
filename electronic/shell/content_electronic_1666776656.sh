Current  mode PWM control is used to regulate the output  voltage as shown in Figure 2. The device has a fixed  switching frequency of 600kHz (TYP). A slope ramp is  added to the sensed peak current ramp to avoid  sub-harmonic oscillation at operation duty cycle higher  than 40%. The error amplifier compares the FB pin  voltage with an internal reference signal to provide an  error signal for the PWM comparator to adjust the duty  cycle which ultimately regulates the output voltage to  the desired voltage. At the beginning of each clock  cycle, the PWM comparator turns on the low-side  MOSFET to ramp up the inductor current. As the  inductor current reaches the level set by the error  amplifier’s output, the low-side MOSFET turns off,  which causes the external Schottky diode to be forward  biased to ramp down the inductor current that delivers  the energy to the load as well as replenishes the output  capacitor.         SGM6623  4.4A, Miniature Boost Converter      8  OCTOBER 2022  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued)  Soft-Start  The SGM6623 implements the internal soft-start  feature to reduce the inrush current drawn during  start-up. When logic high is applied on the EN pin, the  device starts operation and ramps up the reference  voltage to 1.205V in 2.5ms. The 2.5ms soft-start time  ensures the output voltage to ramp slowly, which  effectively reduces the inrush current during start-up.  As shown in Figure 1, the VS pin is the power input for  the device itself and is powered from the converter  output or a voltage source in proper range. When the  VS pin is powered from the converter output, before  enabling the chip, the bias to VS comes from the input  through the inductor and Schottky diode. The  SGM6623 can start up from input voltage as low as  1.5V. During start-up, the controller switches the  N-channel MOSFET continuously until the VOUT  reaches 2.7V. When 2.7V is reached, the normal Boost  regulator feedback takes over the control. Once the  device is in the regulated state, it can work when the  input voltage drops to 0.8V.  When the VS is not self-biased with its own output but  from an independent power source, enable the device  after the VS is biased > 3V stably to avoid continuous  switching without output voltage regulation, in which the  output voltage may trigger the over-voltage protection  and hiccups to output the maximum possible voltage  decided by the OVP threshold.    Over-Current Protection  The  SGM6623  provides  inherent  over-current  protection. The low-side MOSFET is turned off when  the peak current reaches the current limit threshold of  4.4A (TYP), and the low-side MOSFET is not turned on  again until the next clock cycle.     Over-Voltage Protection (OVP)  Over-voltage protection circuitry prevents IC damage  as the result of output resistor divider disconnection.  The SGM6623 monitors the voltage at the SW pin  during each switching cycle. The circuitry turns off the  switch FET when the SW voltage exceeds the OVP  threshold. The switch FET remains in shutdown mode  until SW pin voltage is lower than 13.37V for 100ms.  The OVP threshold of SGM6623 is 13.8V.    Pulse-Skipping Mode  The SGM6623 integrates a pulse-skipping mode at the  light load. When a light load condition occurs, the  EAOUT voltage naturally decreases and reduces the  peak current. When the EAOUT voltage further goes  down with the load lowered and reaches the pre-set low  threshold, the output of the error amplifier is clamped at  this threshold and does not go down any more. If the  load is further lowered, the output voltage of SGM6623  exceeds the nominal voltage and the device skips the  switching cycles. The pulse-skipping mode reduces the  switching losses and improves efficiency at the light  load condition by reducing the average switching  frequency.    Enable and Shutdown  The SGM6623 implements the EN function to turn  on/off the device. A logic signal lower than 0.3V turns  off the device. The EN pin integrates an internal 570kΩ  (TYP) pull-down resistor to prevent the device from  false turn-on when the EN pin is left floating. Apply two  levels logic or analog bias with edge slope rate >  10V/ms to enable/shutdown the device stably. Quick  toggles  during  the  enabling  may  cause  false  over-voltage hiccup if the bias voltage ramps slowly.    Thermal Shutdown  The internal thermal shutdown protection turns off the  device when the junction temperature exceeds 165℃.  The chip will resume operation when the junction  temperature drops by at least 15℃ (TYP).         SGM6623  4.4A, Miniature Boost Converter      9  OCTOBER 2022  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  "}'

The bias  voltage could be from 3V to 12V, but not higher than the  output voltage + 1V, which could be connected to the  VOUT or to any supply rail whose voltage is in the  range as mentioned above. But when the supply rail is  less than 3V, the voltage of EN must be less than 0.3V.  When the VS pin is connected to the VOUT, a 50Ω  resistor  inserted  between  VS  and  VOUT  is  recommended to isolate the VS from potential voltage  surge at the VOUT.    Program Output Voltage  The output voltage of SGM6623 is configured via a  resistive divider connected to the FB pin. Use Equation  1 to program the output voltage. R1 is the top feedback  resistor and R2 is the bottom feedback resistor.     = × +     1 OUT 2 R V 1.205 1 R  or    = × −     OUT 1 2 V R R 1 1.205              (1)  Due to the leakage current of the resistor divider, the  resistance of R2 should be no less than 10kΩ.  Thermally stable resistors with 1% or better accuracy  and of same type are recommended for R1 and R2.  Mount them close to each other for the same thermal  variations.    Figure 3. Output Voltage Programming    Maximum Output Current  For the Boost converter, the maximum input current is  generally limited by the over-current limit. And the  maximum input power (for a given input voltage) is also  limited by the over-current limit. Therefore, the  maximum output power is limited to the maximum input  power minus losses. So, the actual maximum output  current depends on the input current limit, input voltage,  output voltage and efficiency. The input current limit  clamps the peak inductor current. The maximum input  DC current can be calculated by subtracting half of the  inductor ripple current from the current limit value. The  inductor ripple current is a function of the switching  frequency, inductor value and duty cycle. In summary,  the following two equations show the impact of all the  above factors on the maximum output current.  =     × × +     + −     L SW OUT F IN IN 1 ΔI 1 1 L f V V V V           (2)  where:  ∆IL = Inductor peak-to-peak ripple current.

The duty cycle  and input/output voltage relationship under continuous  conduction mode (CCM) is shown in Equation 4:  OUT IN OUT V V V D − =                   (4)  For example, in a 5V to 12V application, the duty cycle  is almost 58.3%. Care should be taken to ensure that  the maximum duty cycle limit (96%, TYP) is not  reached.    The SGM6623 also implements minimum on-time  switching pulse width, which is related to the minimum  duty cycle. In light load condition, the device enters  pulse-skipping mode, and the device operates with  minimum duty cycle in this mode.

Four parameters of  the inductor must be considered in the design: nominal  inductance value, DC resistance (DCR), saturation  current (or 20%~30% inductance-drop currents) and  maximum RMS current (DC plus AC) for a certain  temperature rise.  Inductance and saturation current of an inductor are the  two most important criterions for the inductor selection.  It is recommended to choose a peak-to-peak ripple  current (given by Equation 2) that is in the 30%~40%  range of the maximum DC current of the inductor in the  application. Such ripple factor usually gives a good  compromise between inductor core and converter  conduction losses (due to the ac ripple) and the  inductor size. Inductor DC current can be calculated  based on input-output power balance as given in  Equation 5:  η V I V I IN OUT OUT IN_DC × × =                 (5)  Typically, the inductor value can have a ±20% initial  tolerance. On top of that the inductance may drop  another  20%~30%  when  the  inductor  current  approaches to the maximum (saturation or 20%~30%  drops) at maximum current. This drop is usually given  by manufacturer. Note that the powder iron core  inductors do not have a sharp saturation like ferrite  inductors and show a gradual inductance drop even if  the current peaks are much higher than their maximum  rated currents, which is an important advantage. The  manufacturer specifies the 20%~30% drop current level  for them instead of saturation. However, they are  usually slightly bigger than the similar ferrite inductor.  Finally, the total RMS current of the inductor must be  limited to keep the total inductor losses low and prevent  excessive temperature rise in the inductor. The DCR of  an inductor may increase around 50% if the  temperature is increased from +25℃ to +125℃. Such  temperature rises need to be considered in the  evaluation of the I2R losses of the inductor.  Using an inductor with a smaller inductance in a Boost  converter results in having discontinuous conduction  mode (DCM) range extended to the higher load  currents due to larger ripple. Small inductance can also  result in reduced maximum output current, increased  input voltage ripple and reduced efficiency. Large  inductors with low DCR values can offer better output  current and higher conversion efficiency. However,  smaller inductance usually provides better load  transient response. For these reasons, an inductance  with 30%~40% current ripple (of the peak load current) is  recommended.  SGM6623 implements built-in slope compensation to  prevent sub-harmonic oscillation. Too small inductance  might result in insufficient slope compensation, which  ultimately results in unstable operation. Therefore, the  designer must verify the selected inductor for the  application with the maximum and minimum margins of  the input and output voltages if it is not chosen based  on the recommended values.    Schottky Diode Selection  The external rectification diode selection is critical to  ensure device performance. A high speed and low  forward voltage drop diode is recommended to improve  efficiency. The average current rating of the diode  should be higher than the peak load. The breakdown  voltage of the selected diode should be higher than the  maximum output voltage (13V) with margin. To achieve  smaller size and less cost, Schottky diodes with lower  rated voltages can be used. For example, a 12V output  application requires a minimal of 20V breakdown  voltage.     Input and Output Capacitor Selection  The output capacitors of Boost converter dictate the  output voltage ripple and load transient response.  Equation 6 is used to estimate the necessary  capacitance to achieve desired output voltage ripple,  where VRIPPLE is the peak-to-peak output ripple.
