Also, it can be used for the applications  of 1.8V or 3.3V SIMs, which is powered by its internal  LDOs from 2.7V to 5.5V input signal. The value of the  output voltage can be controlled with the voltage  selection pins of the SGM4558 with the maximum load  current of 250mA. The function of the channel selection  pins is that it can be used to determine the open  condition of the specific channel. The two SIM cards  can be powered by the SGM4558 at once with the  control of the enable pins for each channel, and the fast  translation can be made from channel A to channel B.  The level translator integrated on the SGM4558 can  boost the input signal which is powered by 1.4V to 1.8V  or 3V interface. If the supply voltage is below 3.3V, the  lifespan of the battery can be enhanced as the 90μA  operating current and 2μA shutdown current.  The SGM4558 is available in a Green TQFN-3×3-20L  package. It operates over an ambient temperature  range of -40℃ to +85℃.  "}'

ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION  This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are  not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all  integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions.  Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures  can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle  performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision  integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage  because even small parametric changes could cause the  device not to meet the published specifications.

Both VCCA and VCCB pins should be connected to the power supply pin of the SIM  cards respectively. Also, the voltage of VCCA/VCCB which is controlled by the enable pin of the  SGM4558 can be set to 1.8V or 3V.  2  DVCC  Control Logic Reference Supply Voltage.  3  VBAT  Analog Supply Voltage.  5, 20  CLKA,  CLKB  Card Socket. Both CLKA and CLKB pins of the SGM4558 should be connected to the card  socket of the SIM cards respectively. Also, these two pins are derived by the CLKIN, which can  be level shifted. If VCCA and VCCB obtain its corrected values, both CLKA and CLKB will start to  operate with the connected SIM cards. The pin will be low or left active through CLKRUNA,  CLKRUNB pins if the card socket is not detected by the SGM4558.  6, 19  RSTA, RSTB  Card Socket. These two pins are used to be connected to the RST pins of the card socket  respectively. Also, these two pins are derived by the RSTIN pin. The RST pin is selected  successfully if the card is selected. If VCCA and VCCB obtain its corrected values, both RSTA and  RSTB will start to operate with the connected SIM cards. However, the RST pin is latched at the  current state if deselecting the card socket.  7, 18  I/OA, I/OB  Card Socket. These two pins should be connected to the associated pins of the card socket.  When the SIM card is selected, the I/O pins of the SGM4558 can transmit or receive the  information from the DATA pin. If VCCA and VCCB obtain its corrected values, both I/OA and I/OB  will start to operate with the connected SIM cards.  8  DATA  Microcontroller Side Bidirectional Data Input/Output Pin. The DATA pin can select a card at a  time. There is a weak current source integrated inside the pin. Therefore, the output of the  controller can be open-drain and it remains high state during shutdown mode, while DVCC must  be operated during the progress.  9  RSTIN  Reset Input Pin. The signal is transmitted directly to the selected SIM card.

The clock signal is sent to the CLK pin of the selected SIM card. The  CLKA/CLKB pin will receive the clock signal if the voltage level of CLKRUNA/CLKRUNB is in  high state.  11, 17  ENABLEA,  ENABLEB  Enable Input Pins. These two pins can be used to enable or disable the selected card socket.  12, 16  VSELA,  VSELB  Select Input Pins. These two pins can be used to select the supply voltage level of the connected  SIM cards. Setting it to a high state will provide a 3V power supply to respective SIM card. Setting  it to a low state will provide 1.8V to respective SIM card.  13  CSEL  SIM/Smart Card Select Input Pin. It depends on which is the activated SIM/Smart card.  14, 15  CLKRUNA,  CLKRUNB  Clock Run Input Pins. These two pins are used to determine whether the clock signal always  transmits to the enabled SIM card or be controlled by the selected CSEL.  Exposed  Pad  GND  Ground.
