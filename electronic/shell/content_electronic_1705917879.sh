System  reliability is significantly improved by such integration  compared to the designs with individual ICs or  discrete components. The SGM824A also features an  excellent transient immunity to ignore fast VCC  transients.  The device has an active-low reset output (nRESET)  that is activated by a watchdog expiry event or due to  a low VCC voltage. The nRESET output is guaranteed  to be in the correct logic state even if VCC falls down to  1V. The device also has a complementary active-high  reset output (RESET). The SGM824A is offered in  three fixed VCC reset threshold voltages.  The SGM824A is available in a Green SOT-23-5  package. It operates over an ambient temperature  range of -40℃ to +125℃.    "}'

The SGM824A supervisory circuit asserts  a reset to the supervised μP to prevent the  code-execution errors that may occur due to power-up,  power-down, brownout conditions or other transients.  nRESET is guaranteed to be a logic low for VCC voltage  down to 1V. During power-up, when VCC exceeds the  rising threshold voltage (VRST + VHYS), an internal timer  keeps nRESET in low state for the reset timeout period  (tRP) before nRESET returns to the high state (Figure  1).  If VCC drops below the falling threshold voltage (VRST) (a  brownout condition occurs), a reset is asserted and  nRESET goes low. In general, nRESET remains low for  the tRP (200ms, TYP) period every time after the last  event. So, if during the low period of nRESET, VCC goes  up and dips below VRST again, the internal timer will  restart for a new tRP period. The nRESET output can  source and sink current. RESET on the SGM824A is  the inverse of nRESET.    VCC 1V GND VRST tRP tRD 1V RESET tRD tRP VRST + VHYS nRESET     Figure 1. Reset Timing Diagram    Watchdog Input  The internal watchdog circuit monitors the μP’s activity  by checking the WDI input. If the μP does not toggle the  WDI within the watchdog tWD (1.6s, TYP) period, reset  asserts. So, the code should be written such that  successive toggles on WDI occur in periods not longer  than the lowest tWD time to reset the internal watchdog  timer and prevent μP reset when the code is running  normally. The watchdog timer is cleared by either  toggling WDI or by a pulse with a duration as short as  90ns. While the reset is asserted, the watchdog timer is  cleared and timer does not count. It starts counting  when the reset is released (Figure 2).  To disable the watchdog function, leave the WDI pin  open. If WDI is driven by a 3-state buffer, set it to the  Hi-Z state. In this case the buffer leakage current  should not exceed 10μA. The maximum capacitance  seen on the WDI pin should be less than 200pF to  assure that watchdog remains disabled. The watchdog  input is internally oscillating when it is left open to clear  the watchdog timer and prevent it from generating a  reset. It is driven low during the first 7/8 of the watchdog  timeout period and driven high in the last 1/8 of that.  For example if the WDI input is open and the watchdog  timeout is 1.6s, the watchdog timer will automatically  clear every 1.4s and reset will not occur.

The  low pull-up current of the SGM824A allows using of  them along with the microprocessors with bidirectional  resets, such as the 68HC11. The microprocessor can  force nRESET low when nRESET is pulled high by the  SGM824A with no issues (Figure 3).    nRESET VCC SGM824A μP VCC GND GND VCC VCC Reset Generator     Figure 3．Interfacing to μP with Bidirectional Resets    Negative-Going VCC Transients  The SGM824A is quite immune to short time, negative  VCC transients (glitches) that normally should not  require the entire system to shut down. Resets are  applied to the microprocessor during power-up,  power-down and brownout conditions and not when an  insignificant VCC transient occurs.  An optional 0.1μF bypass capacitor can be placed  close to VCC pin for additional transient immunity.    Watchdog Input Current  The WDI input is internally driven by a buffer and series  resistor from an internal counter chain stage of the  watchdog. Therefore, when WDI is left open, the  watchdog timer is automatically cleared before timeout  (by an internal low-high-low pulse).  To get the minimum WDI input current (minimum power  loss), leave WDI low for the majority of the timeout  period and send a high pulse within the first 7/8 of the  timeout period for clearing the watchdog timer.  Watchdog Software Considerations  To have a more effective watchdog in software  monitoring, rather than generating pulses by a code  segment, set and reset the WDI input at different points  of the program code. For example, set it in the main  program and reset it in a periodic timing interrupt. For  example if WDI is toggled within an unwanted infinite  loop, it will continuously reset watchdog as a normal  condition and the processor is not reset.  Figure 4 shows an example of a good flow diagram.  The WDI is set high at the beginning of the program,  and is set low at the beginning of every subroutine or  loop, then is set high again when the program returns  to the beginning. If the processor hangs in any  subroutine, the WDI toggling will not occur and the  watchdog will reset the processor and correct the  situation.  The reset output may also be connected to an interrupt  input of the μP for a corrective action if preferred.  Note that such watchdog control schemes may not be  optimal if the total power consumption is critical as  discussed in the watchdog input current section.    Start Set WDI High Program Code Subroutine or  Program Loop Set  WDI Low Return     Figure 4.
