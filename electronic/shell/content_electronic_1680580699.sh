This high frequency device does not need  external compensation and is a perfect solution for  compact designs. The 1.8V to 5.5V input voltage range  is suitable for kinds of battery applications. The  minimum input voltage can be as low as 1.6V after  startup. It operates in PWM mode at heavy loads and  automatically enters power-save mode (PSM) at light  loads to maintain its high efficiency.  With its adaptive hysteresis and pseudo-constant  on-time control (AHP-COT) architecture, the load  transient performance is excellent and the output  voltage regulation accuracy is achieved. The device is  available in a Green WLCSP-0.9×1.3-6B-A package.  "}'

ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION  This integrated circuit can be damaged if ESD protections are  not considered carefully. SGMICRO recommends that all  integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions.  Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures  can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle  performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision  integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage  because even small parametric changes could cause the  device not to meet the published specifications.

At medium to heavy loads, the device works in pulse  width modulation (PWM) mode. At light loads, it  automatically switches to power-save mode (PSM). In  PWM mode, the device works with a nominal switching  frequency of 3.5MHz. When the load current falls, the  device goes into PSM to achieve high efficiency with  reducing switching frequency and minimizing quiescent  current. PSM mode can reduce the standby energy  consumption of system. During shutdown mode, the  energy consumption falls below 3μA.    Under-Voltage Lockout (UVLO)  The device implements the under-voltage lockout  (UVLO) with a 70mV (TYP) hysteresis. When the input  voltage falls below the VUVLO, it shuts down the device.    Enable and Disable  A logic high input to EN activates the device, and a  logic low disables the device. An internal 450kΩ (TYP)  pull-down resistor disables the device by default. This  resistor is removed when the device is enabled.    Soft-Start  When EN is set to logic high and after about 260μs  delay, the device starts switching and VOUT increases  with 600μs (typical timing is from the first pulse to 95%  regulated voltage) internal soft-start circuit.    Power Good (PG)  The power good output of SGM61006 will be low in the  condition that the output voltage is less than its nominal  value. If the output is between 96% and 105% of the  regulated voltage, the power good is in high-impedance  state. If the output voltage is less than 91% or greater  than 110% of the regulated voltage, the power good is  driven to low.   The PG pin is an open-drain output with a maximum  sink current of 1mA. A pull-up resistor connecting to  power good output is required. When the device is  disabled or under-voltage lockout, the PG pin is driven  to low (see Table 1). The PG signal connected to the  EN pin of other converters can be used for multiple rails  sequences. Leave the PG pin floating when not in use.  Table 1. Logic Table of PG Pin  Device Information  Logic Status  High Z  Low  Enable   (EN = High)  EN = High, VFB Rising ≥ 0.432V  √    EN = High, VFB Falling ≤ 0.410V    √  EN = High, VFB Rising ≥ 0.495V    √  EN = High, VFB Falling ≤ 0.473V  √    Shutdown   (EN = Low)      √  UVLO  0.7V < VIN < VUVLO    √  Thermal  Shutdown  TJ > TJSD    √  Power Supply  Removal  VIN < 0.7V  undefined    100% Duty Cycle  The device provides low input-to-output voltage drop by  going into 100% duty cycle mode. In this mode, the  high-side MOSFET is constantly turned on and the  low-side MOSFET is turned off. This function can  increase the operation time to the utmost extent for  battery  powered  applications.  To  maintain  an  appropriate output voltage, the minimum input voltage  is calculated by:  ( ) = + × + IN_MIN OUT OUT_MAX DSON L V V I R R            (1)  where:  • VIN_MIN is the minimum input voltage.  • IOUT_MAX is the maximum output current.  • RDSON is the high-side MOSFET on-resistance.  • RL is the inductor ohmic resistance.    Output Discharge  Whenever the device is disabled by enable, thermal  shutdown or under-voltage lockout, the output is  discharged by the SW pin through a typical discharge  resistor of RDIS.    Power-Save Mode (PSM)  Once the load current decreases, the SGM61006 will  enter power-save mode. Then, the device has a  reduced switching frequency and works with the  minimum quiescent current to keep high efficiency. In  power-save mode, the inductor current is discontinuous.  Then a fixed on-time architecture is activated and the  typical on-time is tON = 286ns × (VOUT/VIN).         SGM61006  600mA, 1.8V to 5.5V Synchronous Buck Converter      13  MARCH 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued)  Inductor Current Limit  The device implements an inductor current limit if  over-current or short-circuit exists. Both the peak  current of high-side and valley current of low-side  power MOSFETs are limited to protect the device. The  high-side MOSFET is turned off and the low-side  MOSFET is turned on to reduce the inductor current  when the high-side switch current limit is triggered. The  low-side MOSFET is turned off and the high-side switch  is turned on again when the inductor current drops to  the low-side switch current limit. It repeats until the  inductor current falls below the high-side switch current  limit. The actual current limit value may be larger than  the static current limit due to internal propagation  delays.  Thermal Shutdown  To protect the device from overheating damage,  thermal protection is included in the device. If the  junction temperature exceeds the typical TJSD (+150℃  TYP), the switching will stop. When the device  temperature  drops  below  the  threshold  minus  hysteresis, the switching will resume automatically.

A feed-forward capacitor is recommended to improve  the performance of smooth transition into power-save  mode and reduce undershoot during load transient.  5pF to 10pF is enough for typical applications.    Inductor Design  Equation 3 is conventionally used to calculating the  output inductance of a Buck converter. The inductor  should be selected by its value and the saturation  current. The saturation current of inductor should be  higher than IL_MAX in Equation 3, and sufficient margin  should be reserved. Typically, the current above  high-side current limit is enough, and a 20% to 40%  ripple current is selected to calculate the inductance.  Larger inductor can reduce the ripple current, but with  an increasing response time.  = + L L_MAX OUT_MAX ΔI I I 2   − = × × OUT IN L OUT SW V 1 V ΔI V L f                 (3)  where:  • IOUT_MAX is the maximum output current.  • ΔIL is the inductor current ripple.  • fSW is the switching frequency.  • L is the inductor value.

The voltage rating of input capacitor  must be considered for its significant bias effect. The  input ripple voltage can be calculated from Equation 4.

A bulk capacitor is  suggested to add if the input wire long.   ICIN_RMS = IOUT×ට VOUT × ൫VIN-VOUT൯ VIN × VIN  = IOUT×ටD×൫1-D൯   (5)  For output capacitor design, output ripple, transient  response and loop stability should be considered.  Minimum capacitance of output ripple criteria can be  calculated from Equation 6.   COUT >  ∆IL 8 × fSW × VOUT_RIPPLE             (6)  Both the input and output capacitors should be placed  as close to VIN and GND pins as possible to reduce  noise caused by PCB parasitic parameters.     Layout Considerations  Good PCB layout is the key factor for high performance  operation of a device regarding the stability, regulation,  efficiency and other performance measures.   A list of guidelines for designing the PCB layout of  SGM61006 is provided below:    Place the power components close together and  connect them with short and wide routes. The  low-side of the capacitors must be connected to  GND properly to avoid potential shift.    FB pin is noise sensitive and must be placed  away from SW. Connect the inductor with a short  trace to minimize noise.        Figure 4. Top Layer  Figure 5. Bottom Layer          "}'
