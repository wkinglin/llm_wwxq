It can  charge single-cell Li-Ion or Li-polymer battery in a wide 3.3V  to 11.5V input voltage range (VBUS) from smart wall adapters  or power banks. The switched-capacitor architecture is  optimized for 50% duty cycle to cut the input current to  one-half of the battery current and reduce the wiring drops,  losses and temperature rise in the application.  A two-phase switched-capacitor topology is used to reduce  the required input capacitors, improve efficiency and minimize  the output ripple. Necessary protection features for safe  charging performance including input over-voltage protection  by external OVPFET (QOVP) and input reverse blocking (using  an internal NFET) are provided.  A fast analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with 12-bit effective  resolution is also included to measure die temperature, bus  voltage, bus current, battery voltage and battery current (5  channels) for battery management of the charge process.  The SGM41600 is available in a Green WLCSP- 2.6×2.6-36B  package and can operate in the -40℃ to +85℃ ambient  temperature range.  "}'

A two-phase switched-capacitor  core is integrated in the device to minimize the ripples and  improve efficiency in the voltage divider mode. A FET control  output for protection, a reverse blocking NFET and all other  necessary protection features for safe charging are included.  A high speed 12-bit ADC converter is also included to provide  bus voltage, bus current, battery voltage, battery current, and  die temperature information for the charge management host  via I2C serial interface.  Charge-Pump Voltage Divider Mode  The charge-pump voltage divider mode operates with a fixed  50% duty cycle. The basic principle of operation is shown in  Figure 4. In period 1, Q1 and Q3 are tuned on and VPMID  charges the CFLY and the battery (in series) such that:  VCFLY = VPMID - VBAT  (1)  In period 2, Q2 and Q4 are turned on and CFLY appears in  parallel with the battery:  VCFLY = VBAT  (2)  Ignoring the small fluctuation of the capacitor and battery  voltages in period 1 and 2 in steady state operation, Equation  1 and 2 can be combined to calculate capacitor voltage:  VCFLY = VBAT = VPMID/2   (3)  Ignoring small energy loss in each switching period, the input  and output cycle-average powers are equal. Therefore,  VPMID × IBUS = VBAT × IBAT  (4)  or  IBUS = IBAT/2  (5)  VPMID CFLY Q1 Q2 Q3 CVOUT VBAT Q4 IBUS CFLY IBAT VCFLY VPMID VBAT Period 1 IBUS CFLY IBAT VCFLY VPMID VBAT Period 2   Figure 4. Voltage Divider Charger Operating Principle    Assuming no charge leakage path and considering REFF as  the effective input to output resistance (due to the switch  on-resistances and CFLY losses), the divider can be modeled  as shown in Figure 5. Using this model, the output voltage is  half of the input voltage under no load conditions as explained  before. The SGM41600 has two phases of such architecture  operating at fSW frequency with 180° phase difference. Each  phase provides IVOUT/2 at the VOUT node, so:  VVOUT = ½VPMID - ½REFF × IVOUT        (6)  At low switching frequencies the capacitor charge sharing  losses are dominant and REFF ≈ 1/(4fSWCFLY). As frequency  increases, REFF finally approaches (RDS_QCH + RDS_QDH +  RDS_QCL + RDS_QDL)/2.  REFF VPMID 2:1 VVOUT + - + -   Figure 5. Model of Voltage Divider    The two-phase interleaved operation ensures a smooth input  current and simplifies the noise filtering. The VOUT ripple can  be estimated by first order approximation of CFLY voltage drop  due to the discharge in the half period, plus the discharge  drop during the short dead time (15ns, TYP).  Selecting high quality CFLY capacitors and proper switching  frequency are the key factors for a well performing capacitor  voltage divider. Switching frequency selection is a trade-off  between efficiency and capacitor size. Lower frequency  increases efficiency by reducing switching losses but requires  larger capacitance to maintain low output ripple and low  output impedance (REFF). An optimum switching frequency  can be found for any selected CFLY capacitor to minimize  losses.  Bypass Mode  The SGM41600 is designed to operate in bypass mode when  VBUS is close to the VVOUT. When such valid voltage is present  on VBUS, the device enters bypass mode and all switches  between VBUS and VOUT are fully turned on while the other  switches are kept off. When VBUS is near VVOUT, the bypass  mode offers the best efficiency and the device is capable of  sourcing up to 5.6A (Maximum 4A continuous current is  recommended in this mode).  The output voltage is close to the VBUS minus a voltage drop  caused by the on-resistances of the RBFET plus the two  high-side switches of the two phases in parallel. So the REFF  in bypass mode is:  EFF DS _ QCH1 DS _ QDH1 DS _ QCH2 DS _ QDH2 ( ) ( )| R Bypass mode R R ) R | R ( ≈ + +  (7)  where RDS_QXX is the on-resistance of the switch xx.       I2C Controlled Single-Cell 6A Switched-Capacitor  SGM41600  Fast Charger with Bypass Mode and ADC        12  MARCH 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued)  Charge System  The SGM41600 is a slave charger device and needs a host.  The host must set up all protection functions and disable the  main charger before enabling the SGM41600. The host must  monitor the nINT interrupts especially during high current  charging. It must also communicate with the wall adapter to  control the charge current.  Figure 6 shows the block diagram of a charge system using  the SGM41600 along with a PD controller and other devices.  In this system, the SGM41600 can allow each of the D+/D  lines to be controlled independently to output one of the  preset voltage levels (0V, 0.6V, 1.2V, 2.0V, 2.7V, 3.3V, and  Hi-Z). Each line can be set to one of these presets via I2C in  REG0x36. This allows the implementation of a handshaking  protocol between the charger and an adapter with an  interface that allows adjusting the voltage. Since the adapter  voltage is controllable, the operating point of the charger can  be fine-tuned to ensure high efficiency during charging. When  the smart wall adapter is detected, the AP unit controls the  switching charger (SGM41516) that powers the load system  and the switched capacitor charger (SGM41600) that  provides high current charging. The communication between  those devices is via I2C serial interface.  A typical charge profile for a high-capacity battery using  switching charger and switched capacitor charger together is  shown in Figure 7. During the trickle charge and pre-charge,  the charging is controlled by the switching charger. Once the  battery voltage reaches 3V, the adapter can negotiate for a  higher bus voltage and enable the SGM41600 for charging  (bypass or voltage divider mode). Once the battery voltage  reaches the VBAT_REG point, the SGM41600 provides feedback  to the adapter to reduce the current. This will eventually  reduce and ramp down the bus current below IBUS_UCP_F.  Startup Sequence  The SGM41600 is powered from the greater of VAC or VOUT  (VAC is used as sense input for adapter voltage as well). The  internal watchdog timer is enabled by default and if no I2C  read or write occurs before its expiry, the ADC_EN and  CHG_MODE bits are reset to their default values and after an  initial 8ms power-up time, an INT pulse is triggered to show  watchdog timeout. The host should not attempt to read or  write before this initial nINT signal.  The device does not start charging after powered up,  because by default the charger is disabled. The ADC can be  enabled and the host can read the system parameters before  enabling charge. The charge can be enabled only if VVBUS >  VBUS_PRESENT_R and VBATP > 2.8V.  Device Power-Up from Battery without  Input Source  To reduce the quiescent current and maximize the battery run  time when it is the only available source, the REGN LDO and  most of the sensing circuits are turned off, except  AC_PRESENT, BUS_INSERT and BAT_INSERT functions.  When the BUS_PDN_EN bit is set, the external OVPFET is  turned off, and VBUS pull-down RPD_VBUS is activated to help  discharging VBUS after a hot-plug event. This will keep the  device in low quiescent current mode even after an input  source is plugged.

The protection thresholds that need to be set are AC_OVP,  VBUS_LO, VBUS_HI, BUS_OVP, IBUS_OCP, IBUS_UCP,  BAT_OVP,  IBAT_OCP,  VBAT_REG,  IBAT_REG,  and  VDRP_OVP. If one of the protection trigger conditions is met,  the charger stops switching. It will also turn off the external  OVPFET when AC_OVP or BUS_SC event occurs.  After setting protections, the VBUS voltage is checked to be  between 2 × VBUS_LO × VVOUT and 2 × VBUS_HI × VVOUT to allow  voltage divider mode operation, or between VBUS_LO × VVOUT  and VBUS_HI × VVOUT for bypass mode operation. Charging is  enabled and current flows into the battery when the host sets  bypass or voltage divider mode by writing 001 or 010 in the  CHG_MODE[2:0] bits respectively. Then raising the VBUS  voltage will increase the battery charge current. When the  converter is on, any command to change the charge mode is  ignored. To do so, the charging must be disabled first, and  then the charge mode can be changed by I2C serial interface.  REGN Management  The SGM41600 internal digital core is powered by the REGN  LDO. This LDO is enabled and powered by PMID. A 4.7µF or  lager capacitor is required on the REGN pin.  ADC  The SGM41600 integrates a fast 5-channel, 12-bit ADC  converter to monitor input/output currents and voltages and  the temperature of the device. The ADC is controlled by the  ADC_CTRL register. Setting the ADC_EN bit to 1 enables the  ADC. This bit can be used to turn off the ADC and save power  when it is not needed. The ADC_RATE bit allows choosing  continuous conversion or 1-shot conversion mode. The ADC  operates independent of the faults, unless the host sets the  ADC_EN bit to 0.  The ADC can operate if VVBUS > VBUS_PRESENT_R or VBATP >  2.8V condition is valid. Otherwise the ADC conversion is  postponed until one of them is satisfied. The ADC readings  are valid only for DC values and not for transients.  By default, all ADC channels are converted in continuous  conversion mode except the channels disabled by the  ADC_CTRL register. If the 1-shot conversion mode is  selected, the ADC_DONE_FLAG bit is set to 1 when all  channels are converted, then the ADC_EN bit is reset to 0. In  the continuous conversion mode, the ADC_DONE_FLAG bit  is set to 0.  nINT Pin, Flag and Mask Bits  The nINT pin is an open-drain output and must be pulled up  to a logic high rail. It is pulled low with a duration of tINT to  notify the host when it is triggered by an event. See the  register map for all event flag and control bits.  When an event occurs, a nINT signal is sent to the host and  the corresponding flag bit is set to 1. The flag bit can be reset  by read only after the fault is cleared. The nINT signal is not  re-sent if an event is still present after the flag bit is read,  unless another kind of event occurs. If an event mask bit is  set, that event will not send nINT signal, but the flag bit is still  updated independent of the mask bit.

VAC Over-Voltage Protection (AC_OVP)  The SGM41600 monitors the adapter voltage on the VAC pin  to control the external OVPFET using OVPGATE output. The  VAC over-voltage protection circuit is powered by VAC and is  enabled if VVAC rises above VVAC_PRESENT_R. If VVAC is above  VVAC_PRESENT_R for at least tVAC_IN_DEG time, a 5V gate voltage  is sent to the OVPGATE output to turn on the external  OVPFET. If the VVAC reaches the VVAC_OVP threshold for  tVAC_OVP_DEG deglitch time, the gate voltage starts to drop.  Figure 8 shows the AC_OVP and OVPGATE operation  timings. The VVAC_OVP threshold can be set by I2C serial  interface. The adapter voltage must never exceed the  absolute maximum rating of the VAC pin and the external  OVPFET.    Table 1.

This function is enabled if the external OVPFET is turned on  or if VVBUS rises above VBUS_PRESENT_R. If the VVBUS falls below  2V (BUS_SC event), the OVPFET is turned off, and charging  is stopped. CHG_MODE[2:0] bits are reset to 000 (disable).  Also, BUS_ABSENT_FLAG bit is set to 1, and an INT pulse is  asserted. The device will wait for 650ms before automatically  re-enabling and initiating startup sequence.  During charging, if VVBUS is less than 1.9 × VVOUT in divider  mode or 0.95 × VVOUT in bypass mode, or if the QRB reverse  current rises above 4A, the QRB and OVPFET are turned off,  and charging is stopped. CHG_MODE[2:0] bits are reset to  000 (disable). Also, BUS_ABSENT_FLAG bit is set to 1, and  an INT pulse is asserted.  VBUS Charge Voltage Range (VBUS_LO and  VBUS_HI)  The VBUS_LO and VBUS_HI functions are included to avoid  problems due to wrong VBUS setting for charging. Under no  charge condition if VVBUS is less than (VVOUT × VBUS_LO × 2) or  above (VVOUT × VBUS_HI × 2), the device remains in charge  initiation operation if the voltage divider mode is selected. If  the bypass mode is selected, the range is from (VVOUT ×  VBUS_LO) to (VVOUT × VBUS_HI). Charging will start once VBUS is  within the charge range. VBUS_LO and VBUS_HI functions  are enabled for maximum 100s at startup and are disabled if  IBUS is above IBUS_UCP_R during a period of 100s. The  VBUS_LO and VBUS_HI thresholds can be set by I2C serial  interface.  Input and Battery Over-Voltage Protections  (BUS_OVP and BAT_OVP)  The BUS_OVP and BAT_OVP functions detect input and  output charge voltage conditions. If either input or output  voltage is higher than the protection threshold, the charger is  turned off and CHG_MODE[2:0] bits are reset to 000 (disable).  The BUS_OVP function monitors VBUS pin voltage. The  BAT_OVP uses BATP and BATN/SRP remote sense pins to  monitor differential voltage between the battery terminals. To  minimize the risk of battery terminal short in the  manufacturing process, a series 100Ω resistor on the BATP  pin is required. The BUS_OVP and BAT_OVP thresholds can  be set by I2C serial interface.  Input and Battery Over-Current Protections  (IBUS_OCP and IBAT_OCP)  The IBUS_OCP function monitors the input current via QRB. If  CHG_MODE[2:0] bits are set to enable charge, the QRB is  turned on and the IBUS_OCP function starts detecting the  input current. If the IBUS reaches IBUS_OCP threshold, the device  stops charging and resets CHG_MODE[2:0] bits to 000  (disable). The battery current is monitored by the voltage  across an external 5mΩ series shunt resistor. This differential  voltage is measured between BATN/SRP and SRN pins. If  IBAT_OCP threshold is reached, the device stops charging and  resets CHG_MODE[2:0] bits to 000 (disable). The IBUS_OCP  and IBAT_OCP thresholds can be set by I2C serial interface.  Input Under-Current Protection (IBUS_UCP)  The IBUS_UCP function detects the input current via QRB.  After charging is started, a 100s timer is enabled and IBUS  current is compared with IBUS_UCP_R (selected by the  IBUS_UCP bit). If IBUS cannot exceed IBUS_UCP_R within the  100s  period,  the  charging  will  be  stopped  and  CHG_MODE[2:0] bits are reset to 000 (disable). If IBUS  exceeds IBUS_UCP_R within the 100s period, the timer is  stopped and from then, if IBUS falls below the IBUS_UCP_F  threshold, the charging will be stopped and CHG_MODE[2:0]  bits are reset to 000 (disable).  VOUT Short-Circuit Protection (VOUT_SC)  The VOUT_SC function monitors the VOUT pin for  short-circuit. This function is enabled during charging. If VVOUT  falls below VVBUS/2.28 threshold when the voltage divider  mode  is  selected,  the  charger  is  turned  off  and  CHG_MODE[2:0] bits are reset to 000 (disable). Also, the  PIN_DIAG_FLAG bit is set to 1, and an INT pulse is  generated. When the bypass mode is selected, the threshold  is VVBUS/1.14.  CFLY Short-Circuit Protection (CFLY_SC)  The CFLY_SC function identifies the health of flying  capacitors before and during voltage divider switching  (charging). The device initialization process is started after  CHG_MODE[2:0] bits are set to 010. When VBUS is in the  charge range, the flying capacitors (CFLY) in both phases are  pre-charged. A CFLY short-circuit is detected if they cannot  be charged, and the voltage between VCFHx and VCFLx  remains below 2V. If so, the initialization process is stopped  and CHG_MODE[2:0] bits are reset to 000 (disable). Even if  CFLY capacitors pass the short-circuit test in the initialization  process, the CFLY_SC function remains active and whenever  a VCFLY voltage falls below 2V, the charger is turned off and  CHG_MODE[2:0] bits are reset to 000 (disable). The  PIN_DIAG_FLAG bit is set to 1 and an INT pulse is generated  as well. During a CFLY_SC event, other protection events  such as IBUS_OCP, BAT_OVP or CONV_OCP may occur.       I2C Controlled Single-Cell 6A Switched-Capacitor  SGM41600  Fast Charger with Bypass Mode and ADC        17  MARCH 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued)  A CFLY discharge circuit is activated before the internal  RBFET (QRB) is turned on if VVBUS > VBUS_PRESENT_R to prevent  over-current stress at the start of charging.  Converter Over-Current Protection (CONV_OCP)  The CONV_OCP function monitors the converter switch  operating currents. If the QCHx and QDLx currents reach switch  OCP  threshold  during  voltage  divider  mode,  the  CONV_OCP_FLAG bit is set to 1, an INT pulse is generated,  the charging is stopped, and CHG_MODE[2:0] bits are reset  to 000 (disable).  Battery Voltage and Current Regulation  (VBAT_REG and IBAT_REG)  The SGM41600 has VBAT_REG and IBAT_REG regulation  functions to regulate the battery voltage and current for a  short period before the system can re-adjust the conditions  such that these functions can be disabled. The regulation  thresholds can be set by I2C serial interface.  The VBAT_REG function monitors the differential voltage  between BATP and BATN/SRP pins and if the battery voltage  is above the VBAT_REG threshold, the OVPGATE voltage is  controlled to regulate the battery voltage.  The VBAT_REG_FLAG bit is also set to 1, and an INT pulse  is generated. Then the host can negotiate with the adapter to  reduce the current. This will gradually reduce the current until  the bus current falls to the IBUS_UCP_F and charging will end.  Similarly, the IBAT_REG function monitors the differential  voltage between BATN/SRP and SRN pins to find the battery  current and if the IBAT_REG threshold is exceeded, the  OVPGATE voltage is controlled (reduced) to regulate the  charge current.  If one of the regulation functions is triggered and persist for  650ms when REG_TIMEOUT_DIS bit is set to 0, the charging  will be stopped and CHG_MODE[2:0] bits are reset to 000  (disable). The system should adjust the charging conditions  to prevent the battery voltage and current regulation for more  than 650ms (or prevent triggering of the VDRP_OVP).  Dropout Over-Voltage Protection (VDRP_OVP)  When VBAT_REG or IBAT_REG is active, a large voltage  drop may appear on the external OVPFET and cause  excessive power loss and heat. To avoid that, the  VDRP_OVP function monitors the voltage drop between VAC  and VBUS pins. If it is higher than VDRP_OVP threshold for  tDRP_OVP_DEG deglitch time (set by VDRP_OVP_DEG bit in  REG0x05), the charging will be stopped and CHG_MODE[2:0]  bits are reset to 000 (disable). The VDRP_OVP threshold and  tDRP_OVP_DEG deglitch time can be programmed by I2C serial  interface.  Die Over-Temperature Protection (TDIE_OTP)  The  TDIE_OTP  function  prevents  charging  in  over-temperature condition. The die temperature is monitored  and if the +150℃ threshold is reached, the charging is  stopped and CHG_MODE[2:0] bits are reset to 000 (disable).  An automatic startup sequence can initiate if the die  temperature falls below +130℃.

Adequate voltage margin above maximum surge voltage  2. Not too large voltage margin in order to limit the peak  currents drawn from the source and reduce the input noise  For CVAC, use at least a 1µF low ESR bypass ceramic  capacitor placed close to the VAC and PGND pins. The CVBUS  and CPMID are determined by the minimum capacitance  needed for stable operation and the required ESR to minimize  the voltage ripple and load step transients. Typically, 10μF or  larger X5R ceramic capacitors are sufficient for CVBUS and  CPMID. Consider the DC bias derating of the ceramic  capacitors. The X5R and X7R capacitors are relatively stable  against DC bias and high temperature. Note that the bias  effect is more severe with smaller package sizes, so choose  the largest affordable package size. Also consider a large  margin for the voltage rating for the worst-case transient input  voltages.  External OVPFET (QOVP)  The maximum recommended VVBUS input range is 11.5V. If  the supplied VAC voltage is above 11.5V, or if regulation  functions are needed during load or wall adapter transients,  an external OVPFET is recommended between the USB  connector and the SGM41600. Choose a low RDSON MOSFET  for the OVPFET to minimize power losses.  Flying Capacitors (CFLY)  For selection of the CFLY capacitors, the current rating, ESR  and the bias voltage derating are critical parameters. The  CFLY capacitors are biased to half of the input voltage. To  trade-off between efficiency and power density, set the CFLY  voltage ripple to the 2% of the VVOUT as a good starting point.  The CFLY for each phase can be calculated by equation 8:  CFLY =  IBAT 4fSWVCFLY_RPP  =  IBAT 8%fSWVOUT          (8)  where IBAT is the charging current and VCFLY_RPP is the  peak-to-peak voltage ripple of the CFLY.  Choosing a too small capacitor for CFLY results in lower  efficiency and high output voltage/current ripples. However  choosing a too large CFLY only provides minor efficiency and  output ripple improvements.  The default switching frequency is fSW = 500kHz. It can be  adjusted by FSW_SET[2:0] bits in REG0x01. Selecting a low  switching frequency improves the efficiency, but the voltage  and current ripples are increased.  Output Capacitor (CVOUT)  CVOUT selection criteria are similar to the CFLY capacitor.  Larger CVOUT value results in less output voltage ripple, but  due to the dual-phase operation, the CVOUT RMS current is  much smaller than CFLY, so smaller capacitance value can be  chosen for CVOUT as given in equation 9:  CVOUT =  IBAT × tDEAD 0.5 × VVOUT_RPP                (9)  where tDEAD is the dead time between the two phases and  VVOUT_RPP is the peak-to-peak output voltage ripple and is  typically set to the 2% of VVOUT.  CVOUT is biased to the battery voltage and its nominal value  should be derated for battery voltage DC bias. Typically two  10µF, X5R or better grade ceramic capacitors placed close to  the VOUT and PGND pins provide stable performance.  External Bootstrap Capacitor (CBST)  The bootstrap capacitors provide the gate driver supply  voltage for the internal high-side switches (QCH1 and QCH2).  Place a 100nF low ESR ceramic capacitor between BST1  and CFH1 pins and another one between BST2 and CFH2  pins.  PCB Layout Guidelines  A good PCB layout is critical for stable operation of the  SGM41600. Follow these guidelines for the best results:  1. Use short and wide traces for VBUS as it carries high  current.  2. Minimize connectors wherever possible. Connector losses  are significant especially at high currents.  3. Use solid thermal vias for better thermal relief.  4. Bypass VBUS, PMID and VOUT pins to PGND with  ceramic capacitors as close to the device pins as  possible.  5. Place CFLY capacitors as close as possible to the device  with small pad areas to reduce switching noise and EMI.  6. Connect or reference all quiet signals to the AGND pin.  7. Connect and reference all power signals to the PGND pins  (preferably the nearest ones).  8. Try not to interrupt or break the power planes by signal  traces.
