It  can deliver 800mA load current from 2.5V to 5.5V input  voltage, and the output voltage can be as low as 0.6V.  The high switching frequency minimizes the sizes of  inductor and capacitor. Integrated power MOSFETs  and internal compensation make the SGM6012 simple  to use and fit the total solution in a compact space.  The SGM6012 can operate at a low dropout for the 100%  duty cycle, which can conserve the battery life of  portable  devices.  The  synchronous  architecture  eliminates the external Schottky diode, and achieves  over 90% of the power conversion efficiency. With low  output ripple voltage at light load, the 30\u03bcA quiescent  current and less than 1\u03bcA shutdown current make  SGM6012 the ideal power supply solution for portable  applications.  SGM6012 is available in both adjustable and fixed  (1.2V, 1.8V, 3.3V) output voltage versions. It is  available in the Green TSOT-23-5 package.

{"product_name": "SGM446", "question": "SGM446的有效并联电容是多少？ ", "answer": "SGM446 的有效并联电容为 10 皮法 (pF)。此信息在‘电气特性’表中提供。", "content": "DETAILED DESCRIPTION  The SGM446 can transfer the temperature to the  current directly. The silicon transistors are used to  operate the transducer through a linear characteristic  between output current and temperature. If the collector  current density (r) of two transistors is constant, the  base-emitter voltage can be calculated by (kT/q) \u00d7 Inr,  where k illustrates Boltzmann constant and q illustrates  the quantity of electric charge for one electron. As a  result, r, k and q are constant and the only variable in  the above equation is temperature T. Therefore, the  characteristic is called proportional to absolute  temperature (PTAT).  The thin-film with low temperature coefficient plays an  important role in converting PTAT voltage to the related  PTAT current. Moreover, the scale between PTAT and  total current is constant. The internal structure of  SGM446 transducer is shown in Figure 2.

Internal Structure  The corresponding PTAT current can also be calculated  and converted with two resistors R5 and R6 in Figure 2.  Because of the basic of current mirror theory, Q11 is  used to copy the collector current of Q10 and Q12, which  is the most important transistor as it can provide bias  and leakage current for the rest of the system, so that  the total current can be PTAT with the exist of Q11. R5  and R6 can be used to calibrate the transducer at the  degree of +25\u2103,  and the structure of them is trimmed.    The Explanation of Temperature Sensing  The SGM446 can be easily used in a wide range of  applications. Both the environment of temperature and  the level of supply voltage can influence the accuracy  of the transducer.  The characteristic of SGM446 is PTAT. Because the  relationship between Celsius and Kelvin scale is T (\u2103)  = T (K) - 273.2, the absolute 0 degree in Kelvin scale is  equal to -273.2 in Celsius scale. This means that the  output current of the transducer is equal to the Kelvin  temperature multiplied by the scale factor (1\u03bcA/K). With  this  specification,  the  output  current  can  be  automatically adjusted with the temperature change,  which means that the output current is equal to 298\u03bcA  at the temperature level of +25\u2103 (298K).    Calibration Error  The error of calibration is always set by the factory. It is  defined  as  the  difference  between  the  actual  temperature and the indicated temperature. The  calibration error is also PTAT. For instance, the  maximum calibration error can change from +1.6\u2103 at  -55\u2103 to -2\u2103 at +150\u2103. Figure 3 illustrates the  change of calibration error within the specified  temperature range.

Figure 4 shows  the method about how to trim this calibration error.  VT = 1mV/K - R 100\u03a9 950\u03a9 - - + + + 5V SGM446   Figure 4. Trim of Temperature  In Figure 4, the temperature can be measured and  calculated by the adjustable resistors and the  temperature sensor. The principle of this measurement  is that if it is trimmed at only one temperature, the  calibration error can be zero within the whole  temperature range, and the PTAT current can be  transferred to voltage with 1mV/K scale factor. Also,  this is called an I-V resistor (or a reference of ADC for  current input case) which can be trimmed for  minimizing the calibration error.    Error vs. Temperature: Trimming out the  Calibration Error  The calibration error is tested for each SGM446 when  trimming out. From Figure 5, the calibration error of the  transducer is also PTAT. In addition, from the figure  below, there are curvature and the error of slope at the  extreme of temperature. The effect of trimming is  shown as below.

Trimming out the Calibration Error    Error vs. Temperature: No Trimming  When measuring the temperature or output current of  the SGM446, the total error consists of the calibration  error and the variance of PTAT current. For example, if  there is no trimming, the total error can be increased to  +1.6\u2103 at -55\u2103.    Nonlinearity  The nonlinearity of SGM446 is defined as the maximum  offset between the current curve within the specified  temperature and its fitted straight line. In addition, the  SGM446 has nonlinearity characteristic in its specified  temperature range from -55\u2103 to +150\u2103. Figure 6  shows the typical values of temperature error for Figure  6.  0.6 Absolute Error  (\u2103) Temperature  (\u2103) 0 150 -0.6 -55 0.6\u2103 MAX 0.6\u2103 MAX   Figure 6.

R1 can be adjusted to change the  output of the circuit to 0V at 0\u2103, and R2 can be  adjusted to change the output of the circuit to 10V at  +100\u2103. This method can also adjust the output of the  circuit accordingly with different temperatures. If the  circuit is designed to measure the temperature of +150\u2103  (15V), the V+ voltage of the amplifier should be greater  than 16V. Moreover, the V- voltage should be less than  or equal to -4V to guarantee the flow of PTAT current.

The Accuracy of 2 Points Temperature Trim    Voltage and Thermal Environment Effects  The Power Supply Rejection (PSR) illustrates the  maximum change of output current with the variations  of input voltage. Under the case of non-ideal power  supply, an insensitive output is necessary for the  temperature accuracy. This transducer can also be  series with a hundreds-ohm resistor (such as the  multiplexer made by CMOS).  If the power supply voltage is greater than or equal to  5V, the property of PTAT will not be changed. That is,  the error or change can be regarded as a calibration  error and be easily trimmed by the scale factor (see  Figure 5).  The SGM446 should be used in a low thermal  resistance condition with 5V power supply. Any large  variations or changes of the thermal resistors would  cause self-heating. And the transducer may not work  accurately and properly under this environment.         2-Terminal, High-Precision,  SGM446  Current Output Temperature Transducer      9  NOVEMBER 2022  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  "}

The  calibration error is also PTAT. For instance, the  maximum calibration error can change from +1.6\u2103 at  -55\u2103 to -2\u2103 at +150\u2103. Figure 3 illustrates the  change of calibration error within the specified  temperature range.

Figure 4 shows  the method about how to trim this calibration error.  VT = 1mV/K - R 100\u03a9 950\u03a9 - - + + + 5V SGM446   Figure 4. Trim of Temperature  In Figure 4, the temperature can be measured and  calculated by the adjustable resistors and the  temperature sensor. The principle of this measurement  is that if it is trimmed at only one temperature, the  calibration error can be zero within the whole  temperature range, and the PTAT current can be  transferred to voltage with 1mV/K scale factor. Also,  this is called an I-V resistor (or a reference of ADC for  current input case) which can be trimmed for  minimizing the calibration error.    Error vs. Temperature: Trimming out the  Calibration Error  The calibration error is tested for each SGM446 when  trimming out. From Figure 5, the calibration error of the  transducer is also PTAT. In addition, from the figure  below, there are curvature and the error of slope at the  extreme of temperature. The effect of trimming is  shown as below.

Trimming out the Calibration Error    Error vs. Temperature: No Trimming  When measuring the temperature or output current of  the SGM446, the total error consists of the calibration  error and the variance of PTAT current. For example, if  there is no trimming, the total error can be increased to  +1.6\u2103 at -55\u2103.    Nonlinearity  The nonlinearity of SGM446 is defined as the maximum  offset between the current curve within the specified  temperature and its fitted straight line. In addition, the  SGM446 has nonlinearity characteristic in its specified  temperature range from -55\u2103 to +150\u2103. Figure 6  shows the typical values of temperature error for Figure  6.  0.6 Absolute Error  (\u2103) Temperature  (\u2103) 0 150 -0.6 -55 0.6\u2103 MAX 0.6\u2103 MAX   Figure 6.

R1 can be adjusted to change the  output of the circuit to 0V at 0\u2103, and R2 can be  adjusted to change the output of the circuit to 10V at  +100\u2103. This method can also adjust the output of the  circuit accordingly with different temperatures. If the  circuit is designed to measure the temperature of +150\u2103  (15V), the V+ voltage of the amplifier should be greater  than 16V. Moreover, the V- voltage should be less than  or equal to -4V to guarantee the flow of PTAT current.

The Accuracy of 2 Points Temperature Trim    Voltage and Thermal Environment Effects  The Power Supply Rejection (PSR) illustrates the  maximum change of output current with the variations  of input voltage. Under the case of non-ideal power  supply, an insensitive output is necessary for the  temperature accuracy. This transducer can also be  series with a hundreds-ohm resistor (such as the  multiplexer made by CMOS).  If the power supply voltage is greater than or equal to  5V, the property of PTAT will not be changed. That is,  the error or change can be regarded as a calibration  error and be easily trimmed by the scale factor (see  Figure 5).  The SGM446 should be used in a low thermal  resistance condition with 5V power supply. Any large  variations or changes of the thermal resistors would  cause self-heating. And the transducer may not work  accurately and properly under this environment.         2-Terminal, High-Precision,  SGM446  Current Output Temperature Transducer      9  NOVEMBER 2022  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  "}

A  GENERAL DESCRIPTION  The SGM446 is a 2-terminal temperature sensor with  an output current proportional to absolute temperature.  It can be considered as a constant-current and  high-impedance regulator passing 1\u03bcA/K in the supply  voltage range from 4V to 35V. The SGM446 is  calibrated to 298.2\u03bcA output current at 298.2K (+25\u2103).  Compared with the traditional electrical temperature  sensor, the SGM446 does not need resistance  measurement circuit, linearization circuit, precision  voltage amplifier and cold junction compensation. It  also integrates the compensation of temperature, flow  rate measurement, discrete-component correlation,  biasing proportional to absolute temperature, level  detection of fluids and anemometry.  The high-impedance current output of the SGM446  makes the device insensitive to voltage drops  especially on long lines. Therefore, it is particularly  suitable for remote sensing applications. The multiplex  of the SGM446 is achieved by switching the current  through a CMOS multiplexer or switching the supply  voltage through the logic gate.  The SGM446 is available in Green UTDFN-2\u00d72-2L and  UTDFN-2\u00d72-4L packages. It is specified over a wide  temperature range of -55\u2103 to +150\u2103.

{"product_name": "SGM5200", "question": "SGM5200的输出数据格式是怎样的？ ", "answer": "SGM5200的输出数据格式包括4位通道地址和12位ADC转换结果。", "content": "DETAILED DESCRIPTION  Overview  The SGM5200 is a 12-bit, SAR ADC. It needs an external  voltage reference. An Amplifier can be used between MXO  and AINP for signal conditioning. Figure 1 and Figure 2  show the chip operating time sequences.   The SGM5200 output data is composed of 4-bit channel  address and 12-bit ADC conversion result. To read and  write GPIOs, more details refer to Table 1, Table 2 and  Table 5.  The SGM5200 switches to new multiplexer channel on the  2nd falling edge of SCLK. The input acquisition phase (equal  input capacitor starts charging) begins on the 14th falling  edge of SCLK. The input signal is sampled on the nCS  falling edge.  The TSSOP package of the SGM5200 has four  general-purpose IO (GPIO) pins, and the TQFN package  has one GPIO pin.  The chip refreshes the GPIO status (Input and output) at  the nCS falling edge. The GPI data will be in the same  frame starting with the nCS falling edge (if GPI read  enabled).  The operating time sequence is shown in Figure 2, the  falling edge of nCS clocks out DO15, the remain bits are  shifted out on the falling edge of SCLK. The ADC result is a  12-bit binary data, MSB is shifted out on the 4th falling edge  of SCLK, and LSB is shifted out on the 15th falling edge of  SCLK. Refer to Figure 2, when the ADC conversion ends  on the 16th SCLK falling edge, SDO goes to 3-state. The  chip 16-bit data (on SDI pin) is shifted in on the every rising  edge of SCLK.  The SGM5200 has threshold alarm function per channel. If  ADC results exceed these limits (high and low), the chip  can give alert on GPIO0/GPIO1 pins (detail configurations  in Table 9). If there is an alarm, the alert will be set on the  12th SCLK falling edge in the same frame of ADC  conversion in progress. It will reset on the 10th SCLK falling  edge in the next frame.    Reference  The SGM5200 needs an external reference.    Power Saving  The SGM5200 provides two kinds of ways to power down  the chip. The first way is command control. It depends on  setting DI5 = 1, more details see Table 1, Table 2 and  Table 5. If DI5 is set, the chip will be powered down on the  16th falling edge of SCLK in the next frame. If D15 is reset,  the chip will be powered up on the nCS falling edge. The  second way is asynchronous control by GPIO3. GPIO3 can  be configured as an nPD input (see Table 9). Its output is  active low. The chip goes to power-down at same time  when nPD is 0. The chip will be powered up when nPD is  1.    Device Functional Modes  Channel Sequencing Modes  The SGM5200 has three channel sequencing modes:  manual mode, auto-1 mode and auto-2 mode. Mode  selection is configured by the mode control register (see  Table 1, Table 2 and Table 5). The new channel selection is  valid on the 2nd SCLK falling edge in the next frame in all  three modes (refer to Figure 1).  Once the chip is configured to working in a selected mode,  it keeps working in this mode until the chip is powered down,  reset or reprogrammed. Allows it to exit multiple times and  re-enter this mode without disturbing program register  settings.    Manual Mode  When power-up or after reset the default channel is  channel 0 and the default mode is manual mode.    Auto-1 Mode  In auto-1 mode, the chip scans all selected channels in  ascending order. The selected channels are configured in a  program register. The auto-1 program register setting is  shown in Table 3 and Table 4. The auto-1 program register  is reset to 0hFFFF.    Auto-2 Mode  In auto-2 mode, the chip scans all selected channels from  channel 0 to the last channel. The last channel is configured  in a program register. The auto-2 program register setting is  shown in Table 6. The auto-2 program register are reset to  0hF.    Device Programming and Mode Control  The chip has two kinds of registers named mode registers  and program registers.    Power-Up Sequence  After power-up, the chip is in default manual mode and  channel 0 is set as default channel. User needs to configure  program register and mode register to set the chip working  in target mode.   12-Bit, 1MSPS, 16 Channels,  SGM5200  Single-Ended, Serial Interface ADC      17    SEPTEMBER 2022  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued)  Operating in Manual Mode  The mode control register settings for manual mode are  shown in Table 1. In manual mode, no program register is  required.  The example for the chip how to work in manual mode and  scan channels CH3, CH5 and CH7 is shown in Figure 5. In  this sequence, in the frame N manual mode and channel  CH3 is selected. In the frame N+1, keep in manual mode  and channel CH5 is selected, internal MUX is switched to  channel CH3 on the 2nd falling edge of SCLK. In the frame  N+2, keep in manual mode and channel CH7 is selected,  on the falling edge of nCS, channel CH3 input signal is  sampling and conversion result is sent out in this frame,  internal MUX is switched to CH5. And the chip repeats this  sequence and sends out ADC conversion result data of  CH5 and CH7 in the following two frames.    Table 1.

There are both mode registers and  program registers for auto-1 mode operation.  To let the chip work in auto-1 mode, it is necessary to  configure auto-1 program register firstly to select which  channels are going to be scanned.  The program register settings for auto-1 mode are shown in  Table 3 and Table 4.  Before running in auto-1 mode, the target channels CH2,  CH3 and CH5 (examples) must be configured in auto-1  program registers (details see auto-1 program registers  configuration sequence).  The example for the chip how to work in auto-1 mode and  scan channels CH2, CH3 and CH5 automatically is shown  in Figure 6. In this sequence, in the frame N sent entering  auto-1 mode command and channel CH2 is selected  automatically (the chip find the first selected channel in  ascending order automatically). In the frame N+1, the chip  switches MUX to CH2. In the frame N+2, the chip samples  the CH2 input and gives out ADC conversion result, and the  MUX is switched to CH3 automatically. In the frame N+3,  the chip samples CH3 and gives out ADC conversion  results, and the MUX is switched to CH5 automatically, and  so on. This process repeats until the last selected channel  is reached, and the process loops back from the first  selected channel.   In any case, re-entering auto-1 mode (It may be from auto-1  mode, manual mode and auto-2 mode) will cause the chip  channel scan sequence restarts from the first selected  channel.  Note that changing the auto-1 program register during the  chip is working in auto-1 mode, the chip scan restarts from  the first selected channel in ascending.  Figure 7 shows how the auto-1 program registers is  configured. It is used to pre-select the channels for auto-1  scanning. It needs two operation frames for a complete  configuration.

There are both mode registers and  program registers for auto-1 mode operation.  To let the chip work in auto-2 mode, it is necessary  configure auto-2 program register firstly to configure the last  channel which is going to be reached.   The program register settings for auto-2 mode are shown in  Table 6.  Before running in auto-2 mode, the last target channel CH2  (example) must be configured in auto-2 program registers  (details see  auto-2  program  registers  configuration  sequence).  The example about the chip how to work in auto-2 mode  and scan channels CH0, CH1 and CH2 automatically is  shown in Figure 8. In this sequence, in the frame N sent  entering auto-2 mode command and channel CH0 is  selected  automatically  (the  chip  switches  to  CH0  automatically). In the frame N+1, the chip switches MUX to  CH02. In the frame N+2, the chip samples the CH0 input  and gives out ADC conversion result, and the MUX is  switched to CH1 automatically. In the frame N+3, the chip  samples CH1 and gives out ADC conversion, and the MUX  is switched to CH2 automatically, and so on. This process  repeats until the last selected channel is reached (In this  example, the last channel is CH2), and the process loops  back from channel CH0.  In any case, re-entering auto-2 mode possibly from auto-1  mode, manual mode and auto-2 mode will cause the chip  channel scan sequence to restart from the channel CH0.

The SGM2052 provides the protection function for  output overload, output short-circuit condition and  overheating.  The SGM2052 is suitable for application which has  noise sensitive circuit such as battery-powered  equipment and smartphones.    Input Capacitor Selection (CIN)  The input decoupling capacitor is necessary to be  connected as close as possible to the VIN pin for  ensuring the device stability. 4.7\u03bcF or greater X7R or  X5R ceramic capacitor is selected to get good dynamic  performance.  When VIN is required to provide large current  instantaneously, a large effective input capacitor is  required. Multiple input capacitors can limit the input  tracking inductance. Adding more input capacitors is  available to restrict the ringing and to keep it below the  device absolute maximum ratings.    Output Capacitor Selection (COUT)  The output decoupling capacitor should be located as  close as possible to the VOUT pin. A 10\u03bcF or greater  X7R or X5R ceramic capacitor is selected to get good  dynamic performance. The minimum effective capacitance  of COUT that SGM2052 can remain stable is 4.7\u03bcF. For  ceramic capacitor, temperature, DC bias and package  size will change the effective capacitance, so enough  margin of COUT must be considered in design. Larger  capacitance and lower ESR COUT will help improve the  load transient response and increase the high  frequency PSRR.    Enable Operation  The SGM2052 uses the EN pin to enable/disable the  device and to deactivate/activate the output automatic  discharge function.  When the EN pin voltage is lower than 0.4V, the device  is in shutdown state, there is no current flowing from VIN  to VOUT pins. In this state, the automatic discharge  transistor is active to discharge the output voltage  through an 80\u03a9 (TYP) resistor.  When the EN pin voltage is higher than 1V, the device  is in active state, the input voltage is regulated to the  output voltage and the automatic discharge transistor is  turned off.  The EN pin is pulled down by internal 0.26\u03bcA (TYP)  current source when the EN pin is floated. This current  source will ensure the SGM2052 in shutdown state and  reduce the power dissipation in system.    Adjustable Regulator  The output voltage of the SGM2052 can be adjusted  from 0.5V to 3.3V. The ADJ pin will be connected with  two external resistors as shown in Figure 4, the output  voltage is determined by the following equation:  \uf8eb \uf8f6 = \u00d7\uf8ec \uf8f7 \uf8ed \uf8f8 1 FB OUT 2 R V V 1+R              (1)  where:  VOUT is output voltage and VFB is the internal voltage  reference, VFB = 0.5V.  One parallel capacitor (CFF) with R1 can be used to  improve the feedback loop stability and PSRR,  increase the transient response and reduce the output  noise. Use R2 \u2264 10k\u03a9 with CFF in the range of 1nF to  100nF (effective capacitance), or choose R2 \u2264 1.5k\u03a9  and the value of CFF is unlimited.

Adjustable Output Voltage Application           1.5A, Ultra-High PSRR, Fast Load Transient,  SGM2052  Bias Rail CMOS Voltage Regulator      11  FEBRUARY 2022  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued)  Dropout Voltage  The SGM2052 specifies two dropout voltages because  there are two power supplies VIN and VBIAS and one  VOUT regulator output. VIN dropout voltage is defined as  the difference between VIN and VOUT when VOUT falls 5%  below VOUT(NOM). When the output voltage is lower than  1.6V, VBIAS dropout voltage is not applicable because  the minimum bias supply voltage is 2.5V.  When VOUT begins to decrease and VBIAS is high  enough, the VIN dropout voltage equals to VIN - VOUT.  VBIAS dropout voltage refers to VBIAS - VOUT when the  VIN and BIAS pins are connected together and VOUT  begins to decrease.    Output Current Limit and Short-Circuit  Protection  When overload events happen, the output current is  internally limited to 2.2A (TYP). When the VOUT pin is  shorted to ground, the short-circuit protection will limit  the output current to 1.1A (TYP).    Thermal Shutdown Protection  The SGM2052 can detect the temperature of die. When  the die temperature exceeds the threshold value of  thermal shutdown, the SGM2052 will be in shutdown  state and it will remain in this state until the die  temperature decreases to +140\u2103.    Power Dissipation (PD)  Thermal protection limits power dissipation in the  SGM2052. When power dissipation on pass element  (PD = (VIN - VOUT) \u00d7 IOUT) is too much that raise the  operation junction temperature exceeds +160\u2103, the  OTP circuit starts the thermal shutdown function and  turns the pass element off. The power dissipation must  be less than 6W for the device protection. For example,  when output is short to GND, the short current is about  2A and the input voltage must be less than 3V,  otherwise the SGM2052 may be damaged.  Therefore, thermal analysis for the chosen application  is important to guarantee reliable performance over all  conditions. To guarantee reliable operation, the junction  temperature of the SGM2052 must not exceed 125\u2103.  In order to calculate the maximum power that the  device can dissipate, the following formula is used:  PD(MAX) = (125\u2103 - TA) / \u03b8JA        (2)  where TA is the ambient temperature, and \u03b8JA is the  junction-to-ambient thermal resistance.    Negatively Biased Output  When the output is negative voltage, the chip may not  start-up due to parasitic effects. Ensure that the output  is greater than -0.3V under all conditions. The load is  too high can make VOUT < -0.3V, a Schottky diode can  be added between the VOUT pin and GND pin.    Reverse Current Protection  The NMOS power transistor has an inherent body  diode, this body diode will be forward biased when  VOUT > VIN. When VOUT > VIN, the reverse current  flowing from the VOUT pin to the VIN pin will damage  the SGM2052. If VOUT > (VIN + 0.3V) is expected in the  application, one external Schottky diode will be added  between the VOUT pin and VIN pin to protect the  SGM2052.                      ", "index": 6}

A 10\u03bcF or greater  X7R or X5R ceramic capacitor is selected to get good  dynamic performance. The minimum effective capacitance  of COUT that SGM2052 can remain stable is 4.7\u03bcF. For  ceramic capacitor, temperature, DC bias and package  size will change the effective capacitance, so enough  margin of COUT must be considered in design. Larger  capacitance and lower ESR COUT will help improve the  load transient response and increase the high  frequency PSRR.    Enable Operation  The SGM2052 uses the EN pin to enable/disable the  device and to deactivate/activate the output automatic  discharge function.  When the EN pin voltage is lower than 0.4V, the device  is in shutdown state, there is no current flowing from VIN  to VOUT pins. In this state, the automatic discharge  transistor is active to discharge the output voltage  through an 80\u03a9 (TYP) resistor.  When the EN pin voltage is higher than 1V, the device  is in active state, the input voltage is regulated to the  output voltage and the automatic discharge transistor is  turned off.  The EN pin is pulled down by internal 0.26\u03bcA (TYP)  current source when the EN pin is floated. This current  source will ensure the SGM2052 in shutdown state and  reduce the power dissipation in system.    Adjustable Regulator  The output voltage of the SGM2052 can be adjusted  from 0.5V to 3.3V. The ADJ pin will be connected with  two external resistors as shown in Figure 4, the output  voltage is determined by the following equation:  \uf8eb \uf8f6 = \u00d7\uf8ec \uf8f7 \uf8ed \uf8f8 1 FB OUT 2 R V V 1+R              (1)  where:  VOUT is output voltage and VFB is the internal voltage  reference, VFB = 0.5V.  One parallel capacitor (CFF) with R1 can be used to  improve the feedback loop stability and PSRR,  increase the transient response and reduce the output  noise. Use R2 \u2264 10k\u03a9 with CFF in the range of 1nF to  100nF (effective capacitance), or choose R2 \u2264 1.5k\u03a9  and the value of CFF is unlimited.

VIN dropout voltage is defined as  the difference between VIN and VOUT when VOUT falls 5%  below VOUT(NOM). When the output voltage is lower than  1.6V, VBIAS dropout voltage is not applicable because  the minimum bias supply voltage is 2.5V.  When VOUT begins to decrease and VBIAS is high  enough, the VIN dropout voltage equals to VIN - VOUT.  VBIAS dropout voltage refers to VBIAS - VOUT when the  VIN and BIAS pins are connected together and VOUT  begins to decrease.    Output Current Limit and Short-Circuit  Protection  When overload events happen, the output current is  internally limited to 2.2A (TYP). When the VOUT pin is  shorted to ground, the short-circuit protection will limit  the output current to 1.1A (TYP).    Thermal Shutdown Protection  The SGM2052 can detect the temperature of die. When  the die temperature exceeds the threshold value of  thermal shutdown, the SGM2052 will be in shutdown  state and it will remain in this state until the die  temperature decreases to +140\u2103.    Power Dissipation (PD)  Thermal protection limits power dissipation in the  SGM2052. When power dissipation on pass element  (PD = (VIN - VOUT) \u00d7 IOUT) is too much that raise the  operation junction temperature exceeds +160\u2103, the  OTP circuit starts the thermal shutdown function and  turns the pass element off. The power dissipation must  be less than 6W for the device protection. For example,  when output is short to GND, the short current is about  2A and the input voltage must be less than 3V,  otherwise the SGM2052 may be damaged.  Therefore, thermal analysis for the chosen application  is important to guarantee reliable performance over all  conditions. To guarantee reliable operation, the junction  temperature of the SGM2052 must not exceed 125\u2103.  In order to calculate the maximum power that the  device can dissipate, the following formula is used:  PD(MAX) = (125\u2103 - TA) / \u03b8JA        (2)  where TA is the ambient temperature, and \u03b8JA is the  junction-to-ambient thermal resistance.    Negatively Biased Output  When the output is negative voltage, the chip may not  start-up due to parasitic effects. Ensure that the output  is greater than -0.3V under all conditions. The load is  too high can make VOUT < -0.3V, a Schottky diode can  be added between the VOUT pin and GND pin.    Reverse Current Protection  The NMOS power transistor has an inherent body  diode, this body diode will be forward biased when  VOUT > VIN. When VOUT > VIN, the reverse current  flowing from the VOUT pin to the VIN pin will damage  the SGM2052. If VOUT > (VIN + 0.3V) is expected in the  application, one external Schottky diode will be added  between the VOUT pin and VIN pin to protect the  SGM2052.                      ", "index": 6}

Each channel can support a 6A maximum  continuous load current and be enabled independently  by the ONx pin. The devices have independent control  pin to set the slew rate (or the soft-start time) of VOUTx  for each channel, which can control the inrush current  and reduce the voltage drop. The devices also have the  thermal shutdown function. Only SGM2596D includes  internal integrated quick output discharge (QOD) to  remove the remaining charge from the output when the  switch is disabled.  SGM2596 and SGM2596D are highly integrated. Using  SGM2596 or SGM2596D can reduce the PCB area and  the BOM count greatly, even the cost.    VBIAS Power Supply  VBIAS is the power supply to the inner circuit including  control logic, quick output discharge and charge pump.  The support voltage range is from 2.5V to 5.7V. For  most applications, a 0.1\u00b5F capacitor is sufficient. It is  recommended to use X5R or X7R dielectrics ceramic  capacitor.    Input Capacitor  Turning on the N-MOSFET to charge load capacitor will  generate inrush current, which may cause the VIN drop.  In order to prevent the drop, a capacitor must be placed  between the VINx and GND pins. Usually, a 1\u03bcF input  capacitor (CIN) placed close to the pins is sufficient.  However, higher capacitance values could further  reduce the voltage drop. So, larger CIN can be used to  reduce the voltage drop in high current applications.     Output Capacitor  A 0.1\u03bcF output capacitor (COUT) should be placed  between the VOUTx and GND pins. This capacitor can  prevent parasitic board inductance from forcing VOUTx  below GND when the switch is turned on. It is  recommended that CIN is greater than COUT.  Control Pin  There is an independent control pin ONx to turn on or  turn off the corresponding N-MOSFET for each channel.  When the ONx pin is driven high, the switch will be  turned on, and when the ONx pin is driven low, the  switch will be turned off. The ONx pin is compatible with  standard GPIO logic level threshold, such as 1.2V,  1.8V, 2.5V or 3.3V.  The recommended start-up sequence is: VBIAS power  on first, then VINx power on, and finally to enable the  ONx. Or VINx and VBIAS power on simultaneously, then  the ONx is enabled.   The ONx pin cannot be left floating and must be  connected to either high or low level as requirement.    Soft-Start Control  A capacitor between CTX and GND pins determines the  slew rate of VOUT for each channel. The slew rate can  be calculated using the below equation.  SR = 0.55 \u00d7 CT                 (1)  So, the soft-start time of VOUT is:   tSS = SR \u00d7 VOUT = 0.55 \u00d7 CT \u00d7 VOUT        (2)  where:  SR is the slew rate (in \u00b5s/V).  CT is the capacitance value on the CTx pin (in pF).  tSS is the soft-start time of VOUT.  For the desired rise time performance, the capacitor  voltage rating used on this pin must be 10V or above.  When CT < 100pF, the equation cannot be applied. The  recommended value of CT is bigger than 100pF. If CT =  0pF or left floating, use Table 4 to determine rise times.  The soft-start time is valid only when the ONx pin is  enabled after VINx and VBIAS are ready.

Each channel has a resistor which is not activated to  discharge by default. When the ONx pin is pulled low or  VBIAS is lower than 2.2V (TYP) or over-temperature  happens, the resistor will be connected between the  VOUTx and GND to discharge the output quickly. This  resistor pulls down the output and prevents it from  floating when the switch is turned off.    Thermal Shutdown  Thermal shutdown protects the device from excessive  temperature and can recovery automatically. When die  temperature exceeds +160\u2103 (TYP), both MOSFETs  will be shut down and remained off until die  temperature drops below +140\u2103 (TYP).

Each channel can support a 6A maximum  continuous load current and be enabled independently  by the ONx pin. The devices have independent control  pin to set the slew rate (or the soft-start time) of VOUTx  for each channel, which can control the inrush current  and reduce the voltage drop. The devices also have the  thermal shutdown function. Only SGM2596D includes  internal integrated quick output discharge (QOD) to  remove the remaining charge from the output when the  switch is disabled.  SGM2596 and SGM2596D are highly integrated. Using  SGM2596 or SGM2596D can reduce the PCB area and  the BOM count greatly, even the cost.    VBIAS Power Supply  VBIAS is the power supply to the inner circuit including  control logic, quick output discharge and charge pump.  The support voltage range is from 2.5V to 5.7V. For  most applications, a 0.1\u00b5F capacitor is sufficient. It is  recommended to use X5R or X7R dielectrics ceramic  capacitor.    Input Capacitor  Turning on the N-MOSFET to charge load capacitor will  generate inrush current, which may cause the VIN drop.  In order to prevent the drop, a capacitor must be placed  between the VINx and GND pins. Usually, a 1\u03bcF input  capacitor (CIN) placed close to the pins is sufficient.  However, higher capacitance values could further  reduce the voltage drop. So, larger CIN can be used to  reduce the voltage drop in high current applications.     Output Capacitor  A 0.1\u03bcF output capacitor (COUT) should be placed  between the VOUTx and GND pins. This capacitor can  prevent parasitic board inductance from forcing VOUTx  below GND when the switch is turned on. It is  recommended that CIN is greater than COUT.  Control Pin  There is an independent control pin ONx to turn on or  turn off the corresponding N-MOSFET for each channel.  When the ONx pin is driven high, the switch will be  turned on, and when the ONx pin is driven low, the  switch will be turned off. The ONx pin is compatible with  standard GPIO logic level threshold, such as 1.2V,  1.8V, 2.5V or 3.3V.  The recommended start-up sequence is: VBIAS power  on first, then VINx power on, and finally to enable the  ONx. Or VINx and VBIAS power on simultaneously, then  the ONx is enabled.   The ONx pin cannot be left floating and must be  connected to either high or low level as requirement.    Soft-Start Control  A capacitor between CTX and GND pins determines the  slew rate of VOUT for each channel. The slew rate can  be calculated using the below equation.  SR = 0.55 \u00d7 CT                 (1)  So, the soft-start time of VOUT is:   tSS = SR \u00d7 VOUT = 0.55 \u00d7 CT \u00d7 VOUT        (2)  where:  SR is the slew rate (in \u00b5s/V).  CT is the capacitance value on the CTx pin (in pF).  tSS is the soft-start time of VOUT.  For the desired rise time performance, the capacitor  voltage rating used on this pin must be 10V or above.  When CT < 100pF, the equation cannot be applied. The  recommended value of CT is bigger than 100pF. If CT =  0pF or left floating, use Table 4 to determine rise times.  The soft-start time is valid only when the ONx pin is  enabled after VINx and VBIAS are ready.

Inrush current can be calculated by  the following formula.  IINRUSH = CL \u00d7 dVOUT/dt           (3)    Soft-Start Time  From the Equation 3, we can also calculate the  soft-start time.  tSS = CL \u00d7 VOUT/IINRUSH           (4)  In this example: CL = 22\u03bcF, VOUTx = VINx = 3.3V, IINRUSH =  500mA.  So,  tSS = 22\u03bcF \u00d7 3.3V/500mA \u2248 145.2\u03bcs     (5)  To ensure an inrush current is less than 500mA, the  soft-start time cannot be less than 145.2\u03bcs. The next,  we only need to choose a CT value to meet the desired  soft-start time.     CT Selection  From equation,  tSS = 0.55 \u00d7 CT \u00d7 VOUT           (6)  We can calculate the CT \u2248 80pF.  From the section of soft-start control, we know that  when CT < 100pF, the equation cannot be applied and  the calculated value is not accurate. So we need to  choose more than 100pF capacitor which value is close  and universal. Finally, CT = 220pF is chosen.  We can also refer the following Table 4 to choose CT.  The tR (the rise time from 10% to 90% of VOUTx) at  different CT have been measured under CL = 0.1\u00b5F, CIN  = 1\u00b5F and RL = 10\u03a9.  If tSS is known, we can also know tR = 0.8 \u00d7 tSS \u2248  116.2\u03bcs.  According to the tR, look up Table 4 to get the  recommended value CT which sets the rise time not be  less than the calculated.  When CT is left floating, the rise times can be obtained  from CT = 0pF listed in Table 4.

The large  consumption is far from meeting the application  requirements. Using load switches ahead of these  modules can reduce this leakage current to \u00b5A level,  which can save the standby power consumption greatly.  The configuration is illustrated in Figure 5.

Inrush current can be calculated by  the following formula.  IINRUSH = CL \u00d7 dVOUT/dt           (3)    Soft-Start Time  From the Equation 3, we can also calculate the  soft-start time.  tSS = CL \u00d7 VOUT/IINRUSH           (4)  In this example: CL = 22\u03bcF, VOUTx = VINx = 3.3V, IINRUSH =  500mA.  So,  tSS = 22\u03bcF \u00d7 3.3V/500mA \u2248 145.2\u03bcs     (5)  To ensure an inrush current is less than 500mA, the  soft-start time cannot be less than 145.2\u03bcs. The next,  we only need to choose a CT value to meet the desired  soft-start time.     CT Selection  From equation,  tSS = 0.55 \u00d7 CT \u00d7 VOUT           (6)  We can calculate the CT \u2248 80pF.  From the section of soft-start control, we know that  when CT < 100pF, the equation cannot be applied and  the calculated value is not accurate. So we need to  choose more than 100pF capacitor which value is close  and universal. Finally, CT = 220pF is chosen.  We can also refer the following Table 4 to choose CT.  The tR (the rise time from 10% to 90% of VOUTx) at  different CT have been measured under CL = 0.1\u00b5F, CIN  = 1\u00b5F and RL = 10\u03a9.  If tSS is known, we can also know tR = 0.8 \u00d7 tSS \u2248  116.2\u03bcs.  According to the tR, look up Table 4 to get the  recommended value CT which sets the rise time not be  less than the calculated.

Layout Example  VIN1 Capacitor VIN2 Capacitor VOUT1 Capacitor VOUT2 Capacitor CT1 Capacitor CT2 Capacitor Thermal Relief Vias   Thermal Considerations  Assuming a given ambient temperature and package  thermal resistance, the maximum allowable power  dissipation is calculated by:  \u2212 = J(MAX) A D(MAX) JA T T P \u03b8   where:  \uf077  PD(MAX) is the maximum power dissipation.  \uf077  TJ(MAX) is the maximum operating junction temperature.  \uf077  TA is the operating ambient temperature.  \uf077  \u03b8JA is the package thermal resistance.   The maximum operating junction temperature must be  restricted to +125\u2103 under normal operating conditions.  Care should be taken that the thermal vias are placed  under the exposed pad of the device, thus allowing for  thermal dissipation away from the device.

A. 1    GENERAL DESCRIPTION  The SGM3756 is an asynchronous Boost WLED driver  with high efficiency, low EMI and high output voltage.  The Boost converter integrates a 40V, 1.5A internal  FET which operates at 1.2MHz switching frequency. Its  strong driving ability can drive single or multiple parallel  LED strings, which can be used as LED driver for smart  phone and tablet backlight.  The default LED current can be programmed by the  external current-sense resistor RSET. By varying the  duty cycle of the PWM signal applied to the CTRL pin,  the internal reference voltage is adjusted, which  ultimately adjusts the LED sink current. With full PWM  duty cycle, the internal reference voltage VREF is 200mV  (TYP). The SGM3756 is essentially a driver that adopts  analog dimming control, and it will not produce audible  noise on the output capacitor. The SGM3756 integrates  ringing cancellation, and it can effectively reduce EMI  noise in DCM mode. The SGM3756 provides excellent  line regulation and load regulation, as well as excellent  load transient response. The SGM3756 also features  various protection functions such as open LED  protection, OCP protection and thermal shutdown  protection.  The SGM3756 is available in a Green TDFN-2\u00d72-6L  package.

{"product_name": "SGM3756", "question": "SGM3756 LED驱动器的软启动功能是如何工作的？", "answer": "SGM3756集成的软启动功能通过在启动期间限制GM放大器的输出电压来确保Boost转换器的输出电压缓慢上升，从而有效避免了涌浪电流。启动完成后，设备切换到内部参考电压进行闭环控制。", "content": "DETAILED DESCRIPTION  The SGM3756 is an asynchronous Boost converter that  operates at 1.2MHz switching frequency and integrates  a power FET with peak current limit of 1.5A. The  maximum output voltage can reach 38V. The device is  capable of driving LEDs from 1 series to 10 series and  the input voltage range is 2.7V to 5.5V. The strong  driving capability of the device can drive single or  multiple parallel LED strings, which can be used as  LED driver for smart phone and tablet backlight.  The SGM3756 operates with peak current control, and  the internal compensation circuit greatly reduces the  complexity of the design. The loop design can be  completed with only one external sampling resistor  RSET. Peak current mode controls the on time of the  switching FET by comparing the error signal of the  internal GM amplifier with the inductance current signal.  Through the duty cycle of the PWM signal added to the  CTRL pin, the SGM3756 can set the reference voltage  VREF. When the duty cycle is 100%/10%/1%, the typical  values of VREF are 200mV/20.3mV/2.5mV respectively,  and the supported PWM signal has a wide frequency  range from 10kHz to 100kHz. It can realize linear  dimming in the range of PWM duty cycle 0.2% to 100%.  The SGM3756 also has excellent line regulation and  load regulation, as well as excellent load transient  response performance.

At the  same time, the output current can be programmed  through the resistor RSET connected to the FB pin.    Soft Start-Up  SGM3756 integrates the soft start-up function to ensure  that the output voltage of Boost converter rises slowly  by limiting the output voltage of GM amplifier during  start-up. This method effectively avoids the surge  current. After the start-up is completed, the device  switches  to  the  internal  reference  voltage  for  closed-loop control.    Open LED Protection  Open LED protection feature shuts off the IC in case of  LED or RSET disconnection, which prevents damage to  the device. The SGM3756 monitors the voltage of SW  pin in each switching cycle. When VSW exceeds VOVP  threshold for 8 consecutive cycles, the device turns the  switch FET off, and shuts down the IC. The device  remains in shutdown until the CTRL pin is toggled to  logic high. This function can effectively prevent the  device from being damaged when the output voltage  exceeds VOVP threshold.    Shutdown  When the CTRL pin remains low voltage for more than  2.5ms, the SGM3756 enters shutdown mode. In  shutdown mode, the internal switch FET stops  switching, and the device maintains in a low loss  condition. At the same time, the minimum forward  voltage of the LED array should be kept higher than the  maximum input voltage.

Under-Voltage Lockout  Under-voltage lockout prevents the device from  operating at input voltage below 2.2V (TYP).

The  maximum output voltage can reach 38V. The device is  capable of driving LEDs from 1 series to 10 series and  the input voltage range is 2.7V to 5.5V. The strong  driving capability of the device can drive single or  multiple parallel LED strings, which can be used as  LED driver for smart phone and tablet backlight.  The SGM3756 operates with peak current control, and  the internal compensation circuit greatly reduces the  complexity of the design. The loop design can be  completed with only one external sampling resistor  RSET. Peak current mode controls the on time of the  switching FET by comparing the error signal of the  internal GM amplifier with the inductance current signal.  Through the duty cycle of the PWM signal added to the  CTRL pin, the SGM3756 can set the reference voltage  VREF. When the duty cycle is 100%/10%/1%, the typical  values of VREF are 200mV/20.3mV/2.5mV respectively,  and the supported PWM signal has a wide frequency  range from 10kHz to 100kHz. It can realize linear  dimming in the range of PWM duty cycle 0.2% to 100%.  The SGM3756 also has excellent line regulation and  load regulation, as well as excellent load transient  response performance.
