{"product_name": "SGM2207", "question": "What is the output voltage range of the SGM2207?", "answer": "The output voltage range of the SGM2207 can be adjusted from 1.8V to 15V.", "content": "APPLICATION INFORMATION  The SGM2207 is a high voltage, low noise and low  dropout LDO and provides 800mA output current.  These features make the device a reliable solution to  solve many challenging problems in the generation of  clean  and  accurate  power  supply.  The  high  performance also makes the SGM2207 useful in a  variety of applications. The SGM2207 provides  protection functions for output overload, output  short-circuit condition and overheating.  The SGM2207 provides an EN pin as an external chip  enable control to enable/disable the device.    Input Capacitor Selection (CIN)  The input decoupling capacitor should be placed as  close as possible to the VIN pin for ensuring the device  stability. 1\u03bcF or larger X7R or X5R ceramic capacitor is  selected to get good dynamic performance.  When VIN is required to provide large current  instantaneously, a large effective input capacitor is  required. Multiple input capacitors can limit the input  tracking inductance. Adding more input capacitors is  available to restrict the ringing and to keep it below the  device absolute maximum ratings.    Output Capacitor Selection (COUT)  The output capacitor should be placed as close as  possible to the VOUT pin. 2.2\u03bcF or larger X7R or X5R  ceramic capacitor is selected to get good dynamic  performance. The minimum effective capacitance of  COUT that SGM2207 can remain stable is 1\u03bcF. For  ceramic capacitor, temperature, DC bias and package  size will change the effective capacitance, so enough  margin of COUT must be considered in design.  Additionally, COUT with larger capacitance and lower  ESR will help increase the high frequency PSRR and  improve the load transient response.    Adjustable Regulator  The output voltage of the SGM2207 can be adjusted  from 1.8V to 15V. The ADJ pin will be connected to two  external resistors as shown in Figure 3, the output voltage  is determined by the following equation:  \uf8eb \uf8f6 = \u00d7\uf8ec \uf8f7 \uf8ed \uf8f8 1 OUT REF 2 R V V 1+R              (1)  where:  VOUT is output voltage and VREF is the internal voltage  reference, VREF = 1.235V.  SGM2207 VIN VOUT VIN GND EN ADJ VOUT R1 R2 CFF 4.7pF CIN 1\u03bcF COUT 2.2\u03bcF   Figure 3. Adjustable Output Voltage Application    Choose R2 = 150k\u03a9 to maintain an about 8\u03bcA minimum  load. R1 and R2 can be calculated for any output  voltage range using equation 1 and R1 is recommended  to be less than 470k\u03a9.    Enable Operation  The EN pin of the SGM2207 is used to enable/disable  the device and to deactivate/activate the output  automatic discharge function.  When the EN pin voltage is lower than 0.4V, the device  is in shutdown state. There is no current flowing from  VIN to VOUT pins. In this state, the automatic discharge  transistor is active to discharge the output voltage  through a resistor.  When the EN pin voltage is higher than 1.2V, the device  is in active state. The output voltage is regulated to  expected value and the automatic discharge transistor  is turned off.    No-Load Stability  The SGM2207 can maintain stability without output  load (except internal voltage divider).    Input Power Supply  The input power supply range is from 2.5V to 20V. VIN  must be larger than (VOUT + VDROP) in application. The  input ceramic capacitor must be placed as close as  possible to the VIN pin, this CIN can help improve the  output noise performance of LDO.         800mA, High Voltage, Low Noise  SGM2207  and Low Dropout Voltage Regulator      10  JUNE 2022  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued)  Output Current Limit and Short-Circuit  Protection  When overload events happen, the output current is  internally limited to 1100mA (TYP). When the VOUT pin  is shorted to ground, the short-circuit protection will limit  the output current to 230mA (TYP).    Power Dissipation (PD)  Thermal protection limits power dissipation in the  SGM2207. When power dissipation on pass element  (PD = (VIN - VOUT) \u00d7 IOUT) is too much and the operating  junction temperature exceeds +155\u2103, the OTP circuit  starts the thermal shutdown function and turns the pass  element off.  Therefore, thermal analysis for the chosen application is  important to guarantee reliable performance over all  conditions. To guarantee reliable operation, the junction  temperature of the SGM2207 must not exceed +125\u2103.  The maximum allowable power dissipation depends on  the thermal resistance of the IC package, the PCB  layout, the rate of surrounding airflow, and the  difference between the junction temperature and  ambient temperature. The maximum power dissipation  can be approximated using the following equation:  PD(MAX) = (TJ(MAX) - TA)/\u03b8JA             (2)  where TJ(MAX) is the maximum junction temperature, TA  is the ambient temperature, and \u03b8JA is the junction  -to-ambient thermal resistance.    Layout Guidelines  To get good PSRR, low output noise and high transient  response performance, the input and output bypass  capacitors must be placed as close as possible to the  VIN pin and VOUT pin separately. VIN and VOUT had  better use separate ground planes and these ground  planes are single point connected to the GND pin.                              "}

In single power supply application, for example, when  +VS = 5V, -VS = GND, 1k\u03a9 load resistor is tied from  OUT pin to ground, the typical output swing range is  from 0.03V to 4.97V.    Driving Capacitive Loads  The SGM8091/2/3/4 are not designed for driving heavy  capacitive load. If greater capacitive load must be  driven in application, the circuit in Figure 1 can be used.  In this circuit, the IR drop voltage generated by RISO is  compensated by feedback loop.        Figure 1. Circuit to Drive Heavy Capacitive Load    Power Supply Decoupling and Layout  A clean and low noise power supply is very important in  amplifier circuit design. Besides of input signal noise,  the power supply is one of important source of noise to  the amplifiers through +VS and -VS pins. Power supply  bypassing is an effective method to clear up the noise  at power supply, and the low impedance path to ground  of decoupling capacitor will bypass the noise to GND.  In application, 10\u03bcF ceramic capacitor paralleled with  0.1\u03bcF or 0.01\u03bcF ceramic capacitor is used in Figure 2.  The ceramic capacitors should be placed as close as  possible to +VS and -VS power supply pins.

Amplifier Power Supply Bypassing    Grounding  In low speed application, one node grounding technique  is the simplest and most effective method to eliminate  the noise generated by grounding. In high speed  application, the general method to eliminate noise is to  use a complete ground plane technique, and the whole  ground plane will help distribute heat and reduce EMI  noise pickup.    Reduce Input-to-Output Coupling  To reduce the input-to-output coupling, the input traces  must be placed as far away from the power supply or  output traces as possible. The sensitive trace must not  be placed in parallel with the noisy trace in same layer.  They must be placed perpendicularly in different layers  to reduce the crosstalk. These PCB layout techniques  will help to reduce unwanted positive feedback and  noise.

EN/nFAULT changes back to an input port, only after the device is released from a protection action.", "content": "DETAILED DESCRIPTION  Overview  The SGM2523C/D are 6-pin, 2.6V to 22V eFuses with  thermal shutdown. To reduce voltage drop for low  voltage and high current rails, the device implements a  low on-resistance N-MOSFET which reduces the  dropout voltage across the device.   The configurable rise time of the device greatly reduces  inrush current caused by large bulk load capacitances  or hot-plug boards, thereby the power supply droop will  be reduced or eliminated. The current limit threshold  can be programmed between 0.1A and 1.2A through  an external resistor.   When the output load exceeds the current limit  threshold or a short-circuit event is present, the device  limits the output current to a safe level by increasing the  on-resistance of the power switch. Continuous heavy  overloads and short-circuits that increase power  dissipation of the switch can cause the junction  temperature to rise, in which case thermal protection  circuit will shut off the switch to prevent damage.     Enable and Adjusting Under-Voltage  Lockout (UVLO)  The EN/nFAULT pin can control the state of the switch.  Pulling the EN/nFAULT pin high enables the device.  Logic high of VENR on the EN/nFAULT pin will enable  the device and VENF will turn it off.   IN EN/nFAULT EN 1.39V 1.33V - + GND VIN R1 R2 SGM2523C/D < 27V Zener  Diode   Figure 5. UVLO Thresholds Set by R1 and R2     As shown in Figure 5, the under-voltage locking  threshold is programmed by an external resistor divider  (R1 and R2) from the power input terminal to the  EN/nFAULT terminal to the GND.  Once the input rails under-voltage, the N-MOSFET will  be turned off quickly. If this function is not needed,  connect the EN/nFAULT pin to the VIN rail to avoid it  happens. Do not leave the EN/nFAULT pin floating.   The device implements the input UVLO and sets two  UVLOs in combination with EN/nFAULT. If VEN/nFAULT <  VENF, the device is disabled and EN/nFAULT can set  the VIN rise threshold, so the device can set the section  active voltage to avoid the input rail fluctuation.  When the switching voltage of the devices is more than  15V, a Zener diode of no more than 27V (> 0.5W)  should be added to prevent the input voltage spike from  damaging the device (as shown in Figure 5).    EN/nFAULT as Output Port  When any of over-current protection or over-temperature  protection  occurs, the  device sinks current from  EN/nFAULT, pulling the pin down to alert the host.

Output Ramp Time is Set by CSS    Equation 2 shows how to calculate the total output  ramp time (tSS) when the output rises from 0V to VIN:  tSS = 16.1 \u00d7 104 \u00d7 VIN \u00d7 CSS         (2)  where CSS is in F.  Inrush current can be calculated by the following  formula.  = \u00d7 IN INRUSH OUT SS V I C t                (3)    Rise time can be calculated by multiplying the input  voltage by the slew rate. If floating this pin, the slew  rate of the output obtains a default value ~50V/ms  (minimum tSS).           Power SOA         Figure 8. Power SOA    Over-Current and Short-Circuit Protections  The device limits current to the output in case of output  shorts and overloads. If an event occurs, device goes  into current limit action, and the value of the current  limit (ILIMIT) is set by RILIM resistor:  ILIMIT = 10.5 \u00d7 10-3 \u00d7 RILIM          (4)  \u2212 = \u00d7 LIMIT ILIM 3 I R 10.5 10              (5)  where:  ILIMIT is overload current limit in A.  RILIM is the current limit programming resistor in k\u03a9.  In addition to the general over-current protection, the  SGM2523C/D also integrate fast-trip over-current  protection with quicker response time.    Overload Protection  Once an overload occurs, the internal current limit  amplifier limits the output current to the predetermined  value by increasing the on-resistance of the power  switch.  During current limit regulation, the output voltage drops,  resulting in increased power consumption. The  SGM2523C/D allow ILIM pin floating operation. If ILIM  pin is floating, the current limit will be set as fixed 0.2A  internally.   When the over-current limit condition lasts more than  2ms, the SGM2523C enters the hiccup mode with 2ms  on time and 700ms off time, whereas the SGM2523D  enters shutdown mode.    Short-Circuit Protection  A transient short-circuit occurs, due to the limited  bandwidth of the current limit amplifier, which cannot  respond quickly to this event. The SGM2523C/D  contain a fast-trip comparator with a threshold  (IFAST-TRIP). If IOUT > IFAST-TRIP, the comparator turns off  the N-MOSFET and terminates the short-circuit peak  current across the N-MOSFET rapidly. The fast-trip  threshold is 2 times the overload current limit. The  fast-trip comparator can terminate the transient  short-circuit peak current, and then the current limit  function limits the output current to ILIMIT.  IFAST-TRIP = 2 \u00d7 ILIMIT                   (6)  where:  IFAST-TRIP is the fast-trip current limit threshold, which is  measured in A.          0 5 10 15 20 25 30 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Input Voltage (V)  CSS (nF)  RILIM = 60k\u03a9  RILIM = 100k\u03a9  TJ = +25\u2103   SGM2523C  SGM2523D  Programmable Current Limit Switches      11  NOVEMBER 2022    SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued)  After the fast-trip is triggered, the fast-trip circuit will first  make the FET turn off for several microseconds, and  then the device enters the current limit start-up period,  where the output current is limited to ILIMIT. After this  period, the behavior of the device is the same as that of  over-current.  IFAST-TRIP Current (A) ILIMIT IFAST-TRIP = 2 \u00d7 ILIMIT     Figure 9. Over-Current Protection Levels    Start-Up and IOUT  During the power-up, the IOUT is equal to the smaller  one of Equation 3 and Equation 4.    IN, OUT and GND  To limit the voltage drop on the input supply caused by  transient inrush current when the switch turns on into a  discharged load capacitor, a capacitor needs to be  placed between IN and GND pins. Use a bypass  capacitor as close as possible between IN and GND  pins. Due to the integrated body diode in the  N-MOSFET, it is highly recommended that CIN should  be greater than COUT. When the system power supply is  removed, if COUT is greater than CIN, it will cause VOUT to  exceed VIN.  This will result in current flow through the body diode  from VOUT to VIN. A CIN to COUT ratio of 10 to 1 is  recommended for minimizing VIN dip caused by inrush  currents during start-up. VOUT in the on state can be  calculated as Equation 7:  VOUT = VIN - (RDS(ON) \u00d7 IOUT)        (7)  where RDS(ON) is the resistance of the FET during  on-state.  GND terminal is the ground pin, which is the most  negative voltage in the chip. GND is the negative  terminal of all other terminals unless otherwise  specified.    Thermal Shutdown  Thermal shutdown protects the device from excessive  temperature. Once the device is shut down due to TSD  fault, it will either stay latch-off (SGM2523D) or restart  automatically after TJ drops below [TTSD - 20 \u2103]  (SGM2523C). When over-tempera"}

In single power supply application, for example, when  +VS = 36V, -VS = GND, 10k\u03a9 load resistor is tied from  OUT pin to ground, the typical output swing range is  from 0.095V to 35.905V.    Driving Capacitive Loads  The SGMOP17C-2 is unity-gain stable with heavy  capacitive load. If greater capacitive load must be  driven in application, the circuit in Figure 1 can be used.  In this circuit, the IR drop voltage generated by RISO is  compensated by feedback loop.        Figure 1. Circuit to Drive Heavy Capacitive Load    Power Supply Decoupling and Layout  A clean and low noise power supply is very important in  amplifier circuit design, besides of input signal noise,  the power supply is one of important source of noise to  the amplifier through +VS and -VS pins. Power supply  bypassing is an effective method to clear up the noise  at power supply, and the low impedance path to ground  of decoupling capacitor will bypass the noise to GND.  In application, 10\u03bcF ceramic capacitor paralleled with  0.1\u03bcF or 0.01\u03bcF ceramic capacitor is used in Figure 2.  The ceramic capacitors should be placed as close as  possible to +VS and -VS power supply pins.         Figure 2. Amplifier Power Supply Bypassing    Grounding  In low speed application, one node grounding technique  is the simplest and most effective method to eliminate  the noise generated by grounding. In high speed  application, the general method to eliminate noise is to  use a complete ground plane technique, and the whole  ground plane will help distribute heat and reduce EMI  noise pickup.    Reduce Input-to-Output Coupling  To reduce the input-to-output coupling, the input traces  must be placed as far away from the power supply or  output traces as possible. The sensitive trace must not  be placed in parallel with the noisy trace in same layer.  They must be placed perpendicularly in different layers  to reduce the crosstalk. These PCB layout techniques  will help to reduce unwanted positive feedback and  noise.

{"product_name": "SGM2052", "question": "What are the functions of the SGM2052 and what type of applications is it suitable for?", "answer": "The SGM2052 is a high-performance, low-noise LDO (Low Dropout Regulator) with a fast transient response. It consumes only 96\u03bcA (TYP) quiescent current and provides 1.5A output current. The SGM2052 provides protection for output overload, output short-circuit conditions, and overheating. It is suitable for applications with a noise-sensitive circuit such as battery-powered equipment and smartphones. Some of its functions include input capacitor selection, output capacitor selection, enabling/disabling of the device, adjustable regulation of output voltage, dropout voltage specification, output current limit and short circuit protection, thermal shutdown protection, power dissipation, negatively biased output, and reverse current protection.", "content": "APPLICATION INFORMATION  The SGM2052 is a low noise, fast transient response  high performance LDO, it consumes only 96\u03bcA (TYP)  quiescent current and provides 1.5A output current.  The SGM2052 provides the protection function for  output overload, output short-circuit condition and  overheating.  The SGM2052 is suitable for application which has  noise sensitive circuit such as battery-powered  equipment and smartphones.    Input Capacitor Selection (CIN)  The input decoupling capacitor is necessary to be  connected as close as possible to the VIN pin for  ensuring the device stability. 4.7\u03bcF or greater X7R or  X5R ceramic capacitor is selected to get good dynamic  performance.  When VIN is required to provide large current  instantaneously, a large effective input capacitor is  required. Multiple input capacitors can limit the input  tracking inductance. Adding more input capacitors is  available to restrict the ringing and to keep it below the  device absolute maximum ratings.    Output Capacitor Selection (COUT)  The output decoupling capacitor should be located as  close as possible to the VOUT pin. A 10\u03bcF or greater  X7R or X5R ceramic capacitor is selected to get good  dynamic performance. The minimum effective capacitance  of COUT that SGM2052 can remain stable is 4.7\u03bcF. For  ceramic capacitor, temperature, DC bias and package  size will change the effective capacitance, so enough  margin of COUT must be considered in design. Larger  capacitance and lower ESR COUT will help improve the  load transient response and increase the high  frequency PSRR.    Enable Operation  The SGM2052 uses the EN pin to enable/disable the  device and to deactivate/activate the output automatic  discharge function.  When the EN pin voltage is lower than 0.4V, the device  is in shutdown state, there is no current flowing from VIN  to VOUT pins. In this state, the automatic discharge  transistor is active to discharge the output voltage  through an 80\u03a9 (TYP) resistor.  When the EN pin voltage is higher than 1V, the device  is in active state, the input voltage is regulated to the  output voltage and the automatic discharge transistor is  turned off.  The EN pin is pulled down by internal 0.26\u03bcA (TYP)  current source when the EN pin is floated. This current  source will ensure the SGM2052 in shutdown state and  reduce the power dissipation in system.    Adjustable Regulator  The output voltage of the SGM2052 can be adjusted  from 0.5V to 3.3V. The ADJ pin will be connected with  two external resistors as shown in Figure 4, the output  voltage is determined by the following equation:  \uf8eb \uf8f6 = \u00d7\uf8ec \uf8f7 \uf8ed \uf8f8 1 FB OUT 2 R V V 1+R              (1)  where:  VOUT is output voltage and VFB is the internal voltage  reference, VFB = 0.5V.  One parallel capacitor (CFF) with R1 can be used to  improve the feedback loop stability and PSRR,  increase the transient response and reduce the output  noise. Use R2 \u2264 10k\u03a9 with CFF in the range of 1nF to  100nF (effective capacitance), or choose R2 \u2264 1.5k\u03a9  and the value of CFF is unlimited.

Adjustable Output Voltage Application           1.5A, Ultra-High PSRR, Fast Load Transient,  SGM2052  Bias Rail CMOS Voltage Regulator      11  FEBRUARY 2022  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued)  Dropout Voltage  The SGM2052 specifies two dropout voltages because  there are two power supplies VIN and VBIAS and one  VOUT regulator output. VIN dropout voltage is defined as  the difference between VIN and VOUT when VOUT falls 5%  below VOUT(NOM). When the output voltage is lower than  1.6V, VBIAS dropout voltage is not applicable because  the minimum bias supply voltage is 2.5V.  When VOUT begins to decrease and VBIAS is high  enough, the VIN dropout voltage equals to VIN - VOUT.  VBIAS dropout voltage refers to VBIAS - VOUT when the  VIN and BIAS pins are connected together and VOUT  begins to decrease.    Output Current Limit and Short-Circuit  Protection  When overload events happen, the output current is  internally limited to 2.2A (TYP). When the VOUT pin is  shorted to ground, the short-circuit protection will limit  the output current to 1.1A (TYP).    Thermal Shutdown Protection  The SGM2052 can detect the temperature of die. When  the die temperature exceeds the threshold value of  thermal shutdown, the SGM2052 will be in shutdown  state and it will remain in this state until the die  temperature decreases to +140\u2103.    Power Dissipation (PD)  Thermal protection limits power dissipation in the  SGM2052. When power dissipation on pass element  (PD = (VIN - VOUT) \u00d7 IOUT) is too much that raise the  operation junction temperature exceeds +160\u2103, the  OTP circuit starts the thermal shutdown function and  turns the pass element off. The power dissipation must  be less than 6W for the device protection. For example,  when output is short to GND, the short current is about  2A and the input voltage must be less than 3V,  otherwise the SGM2052 may be damaged.  Therefore, thermal analysis for the chosen application  is important to guarantee reliable performance over all  conditions. To guarantee reliable operation, the junction  temperature of the SGM2052 must not exceed 125\u2103.  In order to calculate the maximum power that the  device can dissipate, the following formula is used:  PD(MAX) = (125\u2103 - TA) / \u03b8JA        (2)  where TA is the ambient temperature, and \u03b8JA is the  junction-to-ambient thermal resistance.    Negatively Biased Output  When the output is negative voltage, the chip may not  start-up due to parasitic effects. Ensure that the output  is greater than -0.3V under all conditions. The load is  too high can make VOUT < -0.3V, a Schottky diode can  be added between the VOUT pin and GND pin.    Reverse Current Protection  The NMOS power transistor has an inherent body  diode, this body diode will be forward biased when  VOUT > VIN. When VOUT > VIN, the reverse current  flowing from the VOUT pin to the VIN pin will damage  the SGM2052. If VOUT > (VIN + 0.3V) is expected in the  application, one external Schottky diode will be added  between the VOUT pin and VIN pin to protect the  SGM2052.                      "}

A    GENERAL DESCRIPTION  The SGM48523C and SGM48524C are dual high-  speed low-side gate drivers for power switches. They  have rail-to-rail driving capability and can sink or source  up to 5A peak current with capacitive loads. The  propagation delays are very short and well matched  between the two channels that make the device well  suited for applications that need accurate dual gate  driving such as synchronous rectifiers. The matched  propagation delays also allow for paralleling the two  channels when higher driving current is required for  example for paralleled switches. The input voltage  thresholds are fixed, independent of supply voltage  (VDD), and compatible with low voltage TTL and CMOS  logic. Noise immunity is excellent due to the wide  hysteresis window between the input low and high  thresholds. The devices have internal pull-up/pull-down  resistors on the input pins to ensure low state on the  driver output when the input is floating.  The dual inverting SGM48523C and the dual  non-inverting SGM48524C are both available in Green  SOIC-8, TDFN-3\u00d73-8L and MSOP-8 (Exposed Pad)  packages.

The switch operates from a wide range of 2.5V  to 5.5V supply voltage, and is controlled by the EN pin.  It can be used in USB power distribution applications.  A 100m\u03a9 low RON N-MOSFET is integrated. The small  size and quiescent current make the device very suitable  for space limited, battery-powered applications.   A number of protection features are provided in the  device including soft-start, current limit and thermal  shutdown. Thermal shutdown shuts off the output  MOSFET and asserts the nFAULT output if the die  temperature exceeds +150\u2103, and the output MOSFET  remains off until the die temperature drops to +130\u2103.  The nFAULT pin asserts low during fault conditions  after a 13ms blanking time to prevent false reporting.  SGM2583 is available in a Green SOT-23-5 package.

This device is  capable for an input voltage supply range of 2.5V to  5.5V. The 4.6MHz PWM mode frequency operation  allows the use of a 470nH output inductor and a  4.7\u03bcF output capacitor.  The SGM6033 operates in power-save mode under  moderate and light load conditions through pulse  frequency modulation (PFM). The 26\u03bcA typical  quiescent current and the power-save mode can  further improve the system efficiency which can  reach a maximum of 90%. The SGM6033 has  excellent load transient response capability. The  SGM6033  also  includes  features  of  internal  soft-start, input under-voltage lockout, thermal  shutdown and overload protection.  The SGM6033 is available in Green TDFN-2\u00d72-6L and  WLCSP-1.21\u00d70.81-6B packages. It operates over an  ambient temperature range of -40\u2103 to +125\u2103.

{"product_name": "SGM6033", "question": "What is the peak conversion efficiency of the SGM6033 synchronous Buck converter?", "answer": "The peak conversion efficiency of the SGM6033 synchronous Buck converter is up to 90%.", "content": "DETAILED DESCRIPTION  The SGM6033 is a synchronous Buck converter  capable of delivering 1A load to the output from an  input supply range from 2.5V to 5.5V. The SGM6033  integrates a synchronous rectifier to improve the  conversion efficiency up to 90% peak, while PFM mode  light load efficiency reaches over 80% at 1mA load.   The device operates with 4.6MHz switching frequency  at PWM mode which significantly reduces the external  components size. The device only needs a 470nH  inductor and 2 \u00d7 4.7\u03bcF as the output capacitors.  Control Scheme  The SGM6033 adopts the COT architecture to regulate  the output voltage while maintaining excellent load  transient response. The device\u2019s internal frequency  loop keeps the switching frequency constant at 4.6MHz  throughout the input voltage range and load current.  The device allows the use of low ESR ceramic  capacitor to maintain output voltage regulation.   At light load, the SGM6033 automatically operates in  PFM mode to achieve high light load efficiency. The  device can seamlessly transit to PFM, DCM or CCM  based on the load current.     Soft-Start  Toggling the EN pin above the 1.5V rising threshold,  the device starts switching with an internal soft-start  time. During start-up, the internal reference voltage is  slowly ramped up to the 0.8V reference voltage to  prevent any output voltage overshoot and reduce the  inrush current drawn from the input.   The current limit protection is active during soft-start,  the device might not start up properly if heavy load is  applied during start-up.    Current Limit, Fault Shutdown and Restart  Output short-to-ground or output over-current will  cause the peak inductor current flowing through the  high-side switch to reach the current limit. If the current  limit is triggered, the device stops switching, turning off  the high-side FET to prevent the inductor current from  continuing to rise. During the over-current event, the  regulator shuts down for about 1.3ms, and the soft-start  circuit attempts to restart for 200\u03bcs. If the over-current  event remains, this pattern repeats, and the device  automatically  resumes  operation  if  over-current  condition is removed.  Under-Voltage Lockout (UVLO)  The SGM6033 implements input voltage UVLO to stop  device operation when the input voltage drops below  the UVLO threshold. The device cannot restart again  until the input voltage raises higher than the additional  170mV (TYP) hysteresis.   Thermal Shutdown (TSD)  A thermal shutdown function is implemented to prevent  damage caused by excessive heat and power dissipation.  Once a temperature of typically +160\u00b0C is exceeded,  the device is shut down. The device is released from  shutdown automatically when the junction temperature  decreases by 15\u2103.

{"product_name": "SGM6033", "question": "What is the recommended value for the resistor R2 in setting the output voltage?", "answer": "The recommended value for the resistor R2 in setting the output voltage is between 200k\u03a9 to 500k\u03a9.", "content": "APPLICATION INFORMATION  Setting the Output Voltage  The output voltage is programmed using a resistive  voltage divider from the output voltage to FB pin. The  voltage divider divides the output voltage down to the  feedback voltage by the ratio:  2 FB OUT 1 2 R V V R R = +   where VFB is the feedback voltage and VOUT is the  output voltage. Thus the output voltage is:  + = \u00d7 1 2 OUT 2 R R V 0.8 R   The recommended value for R2 is between 200k\u03a9 to  500k\u03a9.    Selecting the Inductor  The selected inductor should have enough saturation  current rating to meet the maximum load current. In  addition, the selected inductor value affects the peak  current, PWM to PFM transition point and efficiency.  Use Equation below to calculate the inductor ripple  current:  \u2212 \u2206\u2248 \u22c5 \u22c5 OUT IN OUT IN SW V V V I   ( ) V L f             (1)  The maximum load current, IMAX(LOAD) can be calculated  using Equation below:  \u2206 = \u2212 MAX(LOA\u2206) LIM(PK) I I  I ( ) 2            (2)  When the inductor\u2019s valley current crosses zero, the  device transits from PFM to PWM operation. Use  Equation below to calculate the DC current when the  inductor current reaches zero:   \u2206 = \u2206CM I I  2                  (3)  470nH  is  recommended  for  SGM6033.  For  application\u2019s duty cycle higher than 60%, 1\u03bcH inductor  is recommended. In addition, the recommended  maximum operation duty cycle for SGM6033 is 75%.  The selected inductor should have at least 80% of the  inductance at ILIM(PK).  Inductor\u2019s DCR and inductance affect the conversion  efficiency. Inductor with lower inductance generally has  lower DCR which improves the efficiency, however, the  RMS current is increased due to increased peak to  peak ripple current \u0394I. Higher \u0394I increases the inductor  core loss which reduces the efficiency. Use Equation  below to calculate the inductor RMS current:  \u2206 = + 2 2 RMS OUT(\u2206C) I I  I 12           (4)  Higher inductance results in lower RMS current,  however, transient response is degraded. For the same  family of inductors, higher inductance parts result in  higher DCR and lower saturation current.   Table 1 summarizes the performance effects of  inductance higher or lower than the recommended  0.47\u03bcH inductor.  Table 1.

For the  applications where the SGM6033 is located far away  from the input source, a 47\u00b5F or higher capacitance  capacitor is recommended to damp the wiring  harness\u2019s inductance.     Output Capacitor  A  4.7\u03bcF  0402  ceramic  output  capacitor  is  recommended for SGM6033.

A  GENERAL DESCRIPTION  The SGM447 is a high-accuracy analog output CMOS  integrated-circuit temperature sensor with tiny WLCSP  package. It can operate with a supply voltage of 1.5V in  the lowest gain configuration while measuring the  temperature of -55\u2103 to +150\u2103.  The SGM447 is capable of strong output source and  sink current while driving heavy loads in that it has  class-AB output. Therefore, it is available for sourcing the  input of a sample-and-hold analog-to-digital converter  requiring transient load. Without using external  components such as resistors and buffers on the output,  the SGM447 can deliver the output voltage inversely  proportional to measured temperature from -55\u2103 to  +150 \u2103. Low supply current makes it suitable for  application in  general temperature sensors  and  battery-powered systems.  The gain of the temperature-to-voltage output transfer  function is set by the gain selection input (GS) pin with  two selectable slopes, (-5.4mV/\u2103 at GS = 0 or -8.1mV/\u2103  at GS = 1). If the GS pin is connect to logic high, the  transfer function will achieve the maximum temperature  sensitivity gain. The GS pin can be connected to VDD  or GND without any components such as pull-up or  pull-down resistors to minimize the board area. During  operation or system diagnostics, if the input is driven by  a logical signal, then the system will optimize the gain.  The SGM447 is available in a Green WLCSP-0.8\u00d70.8-  4B-A package. It is specified over a wide temperature  range of -55\u2103 to +150\u2103.

Equation 1 is the parabolic transfer function  reflecting the output voltage in Table 1.  G0: VTEMP (mV) = 868.6mV - 5.434mV/\u2103 \u00d7  (T - 30\u2103) - 0.0003mV/\u2103 \u00d7 (T - 30\u2103) 2            G1: VTEMP (mV) = 1317.3mV - 8.081mV/\u2103 \u00d7   (T - 30\u2103) - 0.0006mV/\u2103 \u00d7 (T - 30\u2103) 2        (1)  For simplicity, the two-point equation can be easily  calculated the output voltage for the corresponding  temperature.

The following steps are the examples for calculating the  corresponding voltage, if the users decide to express  the corresponding value of voltage for the temperature  which is in the range of +20\u2103 to +50\u2103 at GS = 0, the  calculation is shown as below:  ( ) \uf8eb \uf8f6\u00d7 \uf8ec \uf8f7 \uf8ed \uf8f8 760mV - 923mV V - 923mV =     T - 20  - 20 \u2103 50\u2103 \u2103      (3)  ( ) \u00d7 V - 923mV = -5.43mV /  T - 20 \u2103 \u2103       (4)  \u00d7 V = -5.43mV / T +1032mV \u2103           (5)  Users can approximate the needed temperature ranges  by using the above method.    Mounting and Thermal Conductivity  The SGM447 can be easily applied to the PCB board  like other temperature sensors. Cementing and gluing  are also allowed.  For conducting the thermal, the backside of the die is  connecting to GND. However, the temperature of  trances and lands will also affect the reading of  temperature for the temperature sensor.  The SGM447 can be also mounted into a sealed-end  metal tube, dipped into a bath or screwed into a  threaded hole in a tank. To avoid leakage and corrosion,  it is recommended that the corresponding circuit should  be kept dry enough. For cold temperature where  condensation and moisture may occur, it will affect the  operation of the SGM447 because of short circuit. To  protect the temperature sensor from moisture, a  printed-circuit coating can be used.  Thermal resistance junction to ambient (\u03b8JA) can be  approximated as the temperature rise for the power  dissipation of SGM447. The following equation is used  for calculating the die temperature of SGM447:  TJ = TA + \u03b8JA \u00d7 [(VDD \u00d7 IQ) + (VDD - VOUT) \u00d7 IL]    (6)  where:  IQ is the quiescent current,  IL is the load current,  VOUT is the output voltage,  \u03b8JA is 122\u2103/W.  For example, if the users substitute TA = +25\u2103, VDD =  5.5V, IQ = 4.1\u03bcA, GS = 1, VOUT = 2.5mV, and IL = 2\u03bcA in  the above equation, TJ will be +25.0041\u2103, which  means that the temperature error due to the power  dissipation is 0.0041\u2103. One way to reduce the junction  temperature of SGM447 is to reduce the load current.    Output and Noise Considerations  Because of the structure of push-pull output stage, the  ability of sink and source current is enhanced due to  the low output resistance, which means that it can drive  the dynamic loads such as Analog-to-Digital Converter  (ADC). In some applications, the SGM447 can provide  a current source directly to the input capacitance of an  ADC. It can also be widely used in situations where  strong sink and source current are required.  Because of the ripple of the power supply, the  supply-noise gain may have an impact on the results,  and the output capacitance can be used to filter the  noise.  A 0.47\u03bcF ceramic bypass capacitor should be placed  closely on the power supply pin to avoid interference of  noise.       1.5V Dual-Gain Analog Temperature Sensor  SGM447  with Class-AB Output      10  NOVEMBER 2022  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  APPLICATION INFORMATION (Continued)  Capacitive Loads  For noisy conditions, such as driving a SAR ADC, an  output capacitor is necessary to filter out output noise  due to the switching input of the load.

A  GENERAL DESCRIPTION  The SGM6060 is a high voltage and high frequency  Buck converter with 2A maximum output current and  integrated high-side power MOSFET. It implements  peak current mode control to simplify external  compensation design.  With a wide input voltage range of 3.8V to 55V, it is  suitable for a broad range of applications such as  industry equipment.  The SGM6060 operates at fixed frequency and enters  PFM (Pulse Frequency Modulation) mode automatically  at light loads to maintain high efficiency. During startup  and thermal shutdown, the frequency foldback  technique is used to avoid inductor current runaway for  reliable and fault tolerant operation. The current limit  foldback technique is used for reducing power  consumption during output shorted and suppressing  output voltage overshot during recovery.  Switching frequency can be set as high as 2MHz. It  minimizes the EMI noise issues that could interfere with  nearby systems such as AM radio or ADSL modems.  The SGM6060 is available in Green TDFN-3\u00d73-10L  and SOIC-8 (Exposed Pad) packages.

{"product_name": "SGM6060", "question": "What happens when the device's die temperature exceeds +155\u2103?", "answer": "When the device's die temperature exceeds +155\u2103, the thermal shutdown feature is activated to disable the device in order to protect it from damage due to overheating.", "content": "DETAILED DESCRIPTION  Startup and Shutdown  If both VIN and VEN exceed their thresholds, the device  is enabled and starts operation. First, the bandgap  circuit starts working to generate stable reference  voltage and bias current. Then two internal regulators  are established to provide supply voltage for internal  analog and digital circuit respectively. About 30\u00b5s later,  bootstrap capacitor voltage is charged above UVLO  threshold. Then the output starts to rise slowly during  soft-start.  The device is disabled when any of invalid EN voltage,  VIN UVLO and thermal shutdown events occurs. Once  the device is disabled, the high-side switch is turned off  immediately to avoid any other fault triggering.    Soft-Start and Ramp  Every time the device is enabled (after power-up,  pulling EN high), the output voltage is gradually  increased to its regulation value with a ramp (after a  brief 50\u00b5s hold). Soft-start is needed to prevent  triggering of current limit or short-circuit protections or  to avoid output overshooting during startup. Without a  soft-start, the inrush currents of the output capacitors or  the load can cause over-current and the protection  procedure results in non-monotonic startup or even  instability. Overshooting may also occur during startup  after short-circuit recovery. The internal soft-start  voltage (VSS) and reference (VREF) are both sent to the  error amplifier and the lower value of them is the actual  reference that is compared with the feedback voltage  (VFB).    PWM Operation Mode  In the moderate to heavy load conditions, the  SGM6060 runs at fixed frequency with peak current  control mode. The high-side MOSFET is turned on at  the leading edge of internal clock until the sensing  current ramp signal reaches the COMP voltage. If the  switch current does not reach the reference value  (conversion from VC) in a cycle, the switch will also be  turned off for tOFF_MIN (100ns, TYP) before the next  clock.    PFM Mode  In the light load condition, the frequency is reduced  depending on the load to minimize the switching and  gate driving losses and keep the efficiency high.  PWM Comparator and Current Limit  For peak current mode, a signal represent of high-side  current is used as the input of PWM comparator, which  is accurately sampled by internal sensing circuit. After  100ns typical blanking time, the signal is compared with  COMP to determine switching state of high-side  MOSFET. The cycle-by-cycle current limit threshold is  approximately 3.79A.  Note that the measured peak current limits in the  closed-loop and open-loop test conditions are slightly  different, mainly caused by the propagation delay.    Short-Circuit Protection and Recovery  If the output is shorted to the ground, the switching  frequency is reduced. The foldback current limit is  reduced by half to lower the power consumption.  During output shorted condition, VSS is pulled down to  about 0.1V above VFB to reduce the overshot of short  recovery. The current limit resumes its normal value  when VFB exceeds 0.4V.    Bootstrap Floating MOSFET Driver  The power of the high-side MOSFET driver is provided  by an external capacitor between BOOT and SW pins.  An internal bootstrap regulator keeps the bootstrap  capacitor charged and regulated to approximately 4.5V.  The bootstrap voltage is detected by internal BOOT  UVLO circuit with 2.4V rising threshold and 250mV  hysteresis. If the bootstrap voltage falls below its UVLO  threshold, the power MOSFET is turned off immediately.  An internal transistor is used to pull down the SW node  to make sure BOOT capacitor is charged sufficiently.  This design can obviously reduce the output voltage  ripple at small input/output voltage difference and no  load. When the bootstrap voltage is charged above  threshold, the pull-down transistor is turned off and  high-side MOSFET is able to be turned on again.  Except for BOOT UVLO condition, the external circuit  connected to the SW serves as the return path to GND  for the charge current. Enough voltage headroom  should be left to facilitate the charging. When the  external freewheeling diode is on, bootstrap charging  starts until the regulated voltage.         SGM6060  55V, 2A High Frequency Buck Converter      10  DECEMBER 2022  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued)  The converter operates in PFM Mode at no load or light  load, to minimize switching losses and keep the output  regulated. In this mode, the available time for  refreshing the BOOT voltage is reduced, bootstrap  voltage will drop below the regulated voltage (4.5V).  The maximum charged voltage is equal to VIN - VOUT. If  the difference of VIN - VOUT is too small, BOOT UVLO  can be triggered. The internal charging circuit charges  the bootstrap capacitor by the set frequency, until  BOOT UVLO is released.  The designer should make sure that the SW node  bleeding current is higher than the quiescent current of  the floating driver (approximately 20\u00b5A). Usually the  feedback resistors (R1 and R2) are selected such that  the R1 + R2 value is small enough to provide that  current:  + > + OUT OUT _MIN 1 2 V I 20\u03bcA (R R )           (1)    External Bootstrap Diode  To improve the efficiency, using an external boot diode  supplied from a 5V rail (in Figure 3) is recommended in  the following cases:  \uf09f A 5V rail is available.  \uf09f VIN is less than 5V.  \uf09f VOUT is between 3.3V and 5V.  \uf09f High duty cycle applications (VOUT/VIN > 65%).  A low-cost diode like IN4148 or BAT54 can be used.  BOOT SW SGM6060 0.1\u03bcF 5V   Figure 3. External Bootstrap Diode    Adjustable Switching Frequency  The switching frequency is adjusted by connecting an  external resistor (R4) between the FREQ and GND.  Use Equation 2 to calculate R4 resistance:  SW 4 94581 7.24 f (kHz) R (k\u03a9) - =            (2)  For Example, to get 500kHz switching frequency, the  required R4 resistor is 180k\u2126.  An internal frequency foldback technique is designed  by monitoring the FB voltage. It can effectively avoid  the inductor current runaway during startup or  restarting in certain situation.    Error Amplifier (EA)  The output voltage is sensed by a resistor divider  through the FB pin and is compared with the internal  reference. The EA generates an output current that is  proportional to the voltage difference (error). This  current is fed into the external compensation network to  generate the VC voltage on the COMP pin, which sets  the reference value for the peak current that controls  the on time of the power MOSFET.  The operating voltage range of COMP (VC) is between  0.75V and 2.0V in normal conditions. COMP is pulled  down to the ground when the device shuts down. The  COMP voltage must not be pulled higher than 2.8V.    Thermal Shutdown  To protect the device from damage due to overheating,  a thermal shutdown feature is implemented to disable  the device when the die temperature exceeds +155\u2103 (TYP). The chip is automatically enabled when the  temperature falls below +135\u2103 (20\u2103 hysteresis, TYP).

SGM6060 Application Example with 3.3V/2A Output    Design Requirements  In this example, a high frequency regulator with  ceramic output capacitors will be designed using  SGM6060 and the details will be reviewed. The design  requirements are typically determined at the system  level. The known requirements are summarized in  Table 1.  Table 1.

Higher switching frequencies allow  smaller solution size and smaller filter inductors and  capacitors, and the bandwidth of the converter can be  increased for faster response. It is also easier to filter  noises because they also shift to higher frequencies.  The drawbacks are increased switching and gate  driving losses that result in lower efficiency and tighter  thermal limits. Also the duty cycle range and step-down  ratio will be limited due to the minimum on time and/or  off time limits of the converter. In this design, fSW =  500kHz is chosen as a tradeoff. From Equation 2, the  nearest standard resistor for this frequency is R4 =  180k\u2126.  Inductor Design  Equation 3 is conventionally used to calculate the  output inductance of a Buck converter. Generally, a  smaller inductor is preferred to allow larger bandwidth  and smaller size. The ratio of inductor current ripple (\u2206IL)  to the maximum output current (IOUT) is represented as  KIND factor (\u2206IL/IOUT). The inductor ripple current is  bypassed and filtered by the output capacitor and the  inductor DC current is passed to the output. Inductor  ripple is selected based on a few considerations. The  peak inductor current (IOUT + \u2206IL/2) must have a safe  margin from the saturation current of the inductor in the  worst-case conditions especially if a hard-saturation  core type inductor (such as ferrite) is chosen. During  power-up with large output capacitor, over-current,  output shorted or load transient conditions, the actual  peak current of inductor can be greater than ILPEAK  calculated in Equation 6. For peak current mode  converter, selecting an inductor with saturation current  above the switch current limit is sufficient. Typically, a  20% to 40% ripple is selected (KIND = 0.2 ~ 0.4).  Choosing a higher KIND value reduces the selected  inductance.  \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 INMAX OUT OUT 1 OUT IND INMAX SW    = V - V V L I K V f       (3)           SGM6060  55V, 2A High Frequency Buck Converter      12  DECEMBER 2022  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued)  In this example, KIND = 0.3 is chosen and the  inductance is calculated to be 10.34\u03bcH.

A  10\u03bcH inductor from Sunlord SWPA8040S100MT with  4.1A saturation and 3.3A RMS current ratings is selected.  External Diode (D)  The SGM6060 adopts non-synchronous architecture.  Therefore an external diode is required to place  between SW and GND pins. A Schottky diode is  recommended due to the characteristics of fast  recovery and small forward conduction voltage drop,  which can help improve the efficiency and reduce the  rising edge ring of SW node.  For main parameters of diode, the maximum reverse  voltage rating of the selected diode must be greater  than the maximum applicable input voltage. The peak  current rating must be greater than the current limit,  and the average forward current should be greater than  typical load current with enough margin.  In this example, a B380-13-F from Diodes Inc. with 80V  reverse voltage and 3A forward current is selected.  Output Capacitor Design  Three primary criteria must be considered for design of  the output capacitor (COUT): (1) the converter pole  location, (2) the output voltage ripple, (3) the transient  response to a large change in load current. The  selected value must satisfy all of them. The desired  transient response is usually expressed as maximum  overshoot, maximum undershoot, or maximum recovery  time of VOUT in response to a large load step. Transient  response is usually the more stringent criteria in low  output voltage applications. The output capacitor must  provide the increased load current or absorb the  excess inductor current (when the load current steps  down) until the control loop can re-adjust the current of  the inductor to the new load level. Typically, it requires  two or more cycles for the loop to detect the output  change and respond (change the duty cycle). It may  also be expressed as the maximum output voltage drop  or rise when the full load is connected or disconnected  (100% load step). Equation 7 can be used to calculate  the minimum output capacitance that is needed to  supply or absorb a current step (\u0394IOUT) for at least 2  cycles until the control loop responds to the load  change with a maximum allowed output transient of  \u0394VOUT (overshoot or undershoot).  OUT OUT SW OUT 2 I C f  >  V \u00d7 \u2206 \u00d7 \u2206                (7)  For example, if the acceptable transient to a 1A load  step is 7%, by inserting \u0394VOUT = 0.07 \u00d7 3.3V = 0.231V  and \u0394IOUT = 1A, the minimum required capacitance will  be 17.3\u03bcF. Generally, the ESR of ceramic capacitors is  small enough. The impact of output capacitor ESR on  the transient is not taken into account in Equation 7.  Equation 8 can be used for the output ripple criteria and  finding the minimum output capacitance needed.  VORIPPLE is the maximum acceptable ripple. In this  example, the allowed ripple is 33mV that results in  minimum capacitance of 4.7\u03bcF.  OUT SW ORIPPLE I   8 >  1 C f V \u2206 \u00d7 \u00d7 L             (8)  Note that the impact of output capacitor ESR on the  ripple is not considered in Equation 8. Use Equation 9  to calculate the maximum acceptable ESR of the output  capacitor to meet the output voltage ripple requirement.  In this example, the ESR must be less than  33mV/0.62A = 53.2m\u03a9.  ORIPPLE ESR V R I < \u2206L               (9)  Higher nominal capacitance value must be chosen due  to aging, temperature, and DC bias derating of the  output capacitors. In this example, a 22\u03bcF/25V ceramic  capacitor with X7R dielectric and 3m\u03a9 ESR is selected.  There is a limit to the amount of ripple current that a  capacitor can handle without damage or overheating.  The inductor ripple is bypassed through the output  capacitor. Equation 10 calculates the RMS current that  the output capacitor must support. In this example, it is  179mA.

And it also has a low-level  active manual reset (MR \u0d24 \u0d24\u0d24 \u0d24\u0d24) function.  The SGM708 provides a 1.25V threshold detector.  When the power supply fails, the battery power is low,  or the additional power supply needs to be monitored,  this detector can help.  The SGM708 is available in Green SOIC-8 package. It  operates over an ambient temperature range of -40\u2103  to +85\u2103.

A. 2  GENERAL DESCRIPTION  The SGM8747 is a single, high speed, low power  comparator, which features a fast 155ns propagation  delay. The device is optimized for low voltage operation  on 3V or 5V supply, and consumes only 22\u03bcA supply  current.  The SGM8747 supports rail-to-rail input and output  operation. The input common mode voltage range is  from -0.1V to (+VS) + 0.1V, and the output voltage  swing is within 0.2V of the rails without external pull-up  or pull-down resistor. The device can be compatible  with CMOS and TTL logics. Any input or output pin has  a continuous short-circuit protection to both power  supply rails. The SGM8747 has an internal hysteresis  for reducing comparator sensitivity to noise, even when  the input signals move slowly.  The SGM8747 is available in Green SOT-23-5 and  SC70-5 packages. It is rated over the -40\u2103 to +85\u2103  temperature range.

{"product_name": "SGM8747", "question": "What is the purpose of the internal hysteresis in the SGM8747 comparator?", "answer": "The purpose of the internal hysteresis in the SGM8747 comparator is to ease the effect of noise and parasitic parameters. It is particularly useful when the inputs of the comparator are almost equal, which can lead to frequent switching. The internal hysteresis helps to avoid this switching, providing stability and reducing susceptibility to noise interference and parasitic effects. Additionally, it allows for operation without the need for any external components.", "content": "DETAILED DESCRIPTION  The SGM8747 is a single, high speed, low power  comparator with internal hysteresis. The device is  optimized for low voltage operation from 2.7V to 5.5V  single supply. It supports rail-to-rail input and output  operation. With 4mA output current, the output voltage  swing is within 190mV of the rails without external  pull-up or pull-down circuitry. The SGM8747 is suitable  for portable equipment. It can be compatible with  CMOS and TTL logics.  There are a lot of comparators switched frequently for  the linear region as the effect of noise and parasitic  parameters, and the condition of this negative situation  is when the one input of the comparator tends to reach  the other input voltage. In order to ease the effect of  noise and parasitic parameter, there is a 2.5mV internal  hysteresis inside the comparator.  There are two trip points which are made by the  comparator: the trip points when rising edge occurs and  the trip points when falling edge occurs. And the gap  between two trip points is the hysteresis of the  comparator. The offset voltage VOS is defined as the  average value of the two trip points. For the condition  which two inputs of the comparator are nearly equal,  the internal hysteresis will launch to avoid the  frequently switching at this case. For the normal  comparator other than SGM8747, the users usually use  external resistors connected at +IN pin to provide  hysteresis, while the internal hysteresis of SGM8747  can provide internal hysteresis without any external  component. However, if users need more hysteresis to  reject the influence of noise or parasitic parameters,  please add the external resistors at +IN pin to increase  the hysteresis.        Figure 1. The Waveform for Input and Output,   Non-Inverting Input Varied  On the condition shown in Figure 1, the -IN is fixed  while +IN is varied, and the corresponding output is  shown under the figure of input signal. However, if +IN  is fixed while -IN is varied, the output will be inverted.    Output Structure  In Figure 2, the SGM8747 has a push-pull output stage.  When output is changed from logic high/low to low/high,  the changed sink/source current pulls/pushes output  pin to logic low/high. Beginning this transition, larger  sink/source current is used to create a high slew rate  transit from high/low to low/high. Once the output  voltage reaches VOL/VOH, it will reduce the sink/source  current to a just right value to maintain the VOL/VOH  static condition. This current-driven push-pull output  stage will significantly reduce the power consumption in  application system.  If low slew rate transition is needed in system design,  adjusting the load capacitance will change the slew rate.  The heavier capacitive load will slow down the output  voltage transition. This feature will be used to reduce  the interference generated by fast edge of transition  between 1 and 0 in noise-sensitive system.        Figure 2.

When VIN is required to provide large current  instantaneously, a large effective input capacitor is  required. Multiple input capacitors can limit the input  tracking inductance. Adding more input capacitors is  available to restrict the ringing and to keep it below the  device absolute maximum ratings.    Output Capacitor Selection (COUT1, COUT2)  The output decoupling capacitors should be placed as  close as possible to the OUTx pins. 0.47\u03bcF or larger  X7R or X5R ceramic capacitors are selected to get  good dynamic performance. For ceramic capacitors,  temperature, DC bias and package size will change the  effective capacitance, so enough margins of COUT1 and  COUT2 must be considered in design. Additionally, COUT1  and COUT2 with larger capacitance and lower ESR will  help increase the high frequency PSRR and improve  the load transient response.    Enable Operation  The ENx pins of the SGM2206 are used to  enable/disable the device.  When the ENx pins voltages are low, the device is in  shutdown state. There is no current flowing from IN to  OUTx pins. When the ENx pins voltages are high, the  device is in active state. The output voltage is regulated  to expected value.    Output Current Limit and Short-Circuit  Protection  When overload events happen, the output current is  internally limited to 200mA (TYP). When the OUT pin is  shorted to ground, the short-circuit protection will limit  the output current to 55mA (TYP).    Layout Guidelines  To get good PSRR, low output noise and high transient  response performance, the input and output bypass  capacitors must be placed as close as possible to the  IN pin and OUTx pins separately. VIN and VOUT had  better use separate ground planes and these ground  planes are single point connected to the GND pin.                                  "}
{"product_name": "SGM860", "question": "What is the threshold accuracy of the SGM860 Quad Supply Voltage Supervisors?", "answer": "The threshold accuracy of the SGM860 Quad Supply Voltage Supervisors is 0.35% (TYP).", "content": "  SGM860  Quad Supply Voltage Supervisors  with Adjustable Delay and Watchdog Timer      SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  NOVEMBER 2023 \u2013 REV. A    GENERAL DESCRIPTION  The SGM860 is a family of supply voltage supervisors  (SVSs). It has four channels and each one can monitor  a power rail with a high threshold accuracy of 0.35%  (TYP). It also features very low quiescent current of  6\u03bcA (TYP).  Among the supply voltage supervisor (SVS-x, x = 1, 2,  3, 4) circuits, four power rails are higher than 0.4V and  one power rail is less than 0.4V (even with negative  voltage). Once the SENSEy (y = 1, 2, 3, 4L, 4H) input  voltage goes down below the configurable threshold, a  nRESETx signal can be asserted by each SVS-x. The  threshold of each SVS-x can be configured by the  external resistors.  A delay can be configured for each SVS-x before  nRESETx is released. The delay time for each SVS can  be set independently between 1.45ms and 10s via the  CTx pin connection. Only SVS-1 has a manual reset  signal (nMR) that the nRESETx is activated by a logic  low of nMR. SVS-4 has two comparators to monitor the  threshold window and the extra comparator can be  used as a fifth SVS to monitor the negative voltage  based on the voltage reference VREF.   The SGM860 is available in a Green TQFN-4\u00d74-20BL  package. It operates over a junction temperature range  of -40\u2103 to +125\u2103.

It is recommended to connect this pin to GND.  12  GND  G  Ground.  13  VREF  O  Reference Voltage Output Pin. SENSE4H can monitor a negative voltage if a resistor is  connected between VREF and the negative power rail. This pin is designed to output  current to the resistor(s). The resistor(s) does(do) not allow a voltage higher than 1.2V.  This pin cannot be connected to a capacitor only.  14  VDD  I  Supply Voltage Pin. It is recommended to connect a 0.1\u03bcF ceramic capacitor near this  pin.  15  nRESET1  O  nRESET1 to nRESET4 are the active-low reset outputs of for SVS-1 to SVS-4  respectively.  For SGM860A, nRESETx is an open-drain output pin. A pull-up resistor connected to VDD  or other source is required. nRESETx goes low when asserted and goes high when  released after the delay time set by CTx ends.  For SGM860B, nRESETx is a push-pull output pin. This pin goes low when nRESETx is  asserted and goes high when nRESETx is released after the delay time set by CTx ends.  16  nRESET2  O  17  nRESET3  O  18  nRESET4  O  19  nWDO  O  Watchdog Timer Output Pin.  For SGM860A, nWDO is an open-drain output pin. When the watchdog timer runs out,  this pin goes low. If not, it remains high.  For SGM860B, nWDO is a push-pull output pin. When the watchdog timer runs out, this  pin goes low. If not, it remains high.  20  WDI  I  Watchdog Timer Trigger Input Pin. A rising or falling edge within 630ms (TYP) period at  this pin avoids the timeout failure of nWDO. The timer starts again once nRESET1 is  released.  Exposed  Pad  EP  G  Exposed Pad. Connect it to GND or other thermal pattern on the PCB.    NOTE: O = output; I = input; G = ground.

It has four SVS function sets within one  device, including a watchdog timer, a window  comparator and negative voltage detection. The  SGM860 will assert the nRESETx (x = 1, 2, 3, 4)  signals as shown in Table 1 to Table 4. When the reset  signal is released, the nRESETx remains asserted  during the delay time programmed by the users. It also  features very low quiescent current of 6\u03bcA (TYP).    Voltage Monitoring  With an external resistor divider, any voltage threshold  over 0.4V can be monitored through each SENSEy (y =  1, 2, 3, 4L) pin. The SENSE4H pin can detect any  over-voltage above 0.4V, or detect negative voltage  through an external resistor divider. For more details,  see the Sensing a Negative Voltage section. The  SGM860 supports a wide range of voltage threshold  detection and adjustable reset delay time, making  these devices suitable for plenty of applications.  The SGM860 is not susceptible to short negative  transients on SENSEy. The curve of SENSEy minimum  pulse width vs. threshold overdrive voltage shows that  the sensitivity to transients depends on threshold  overdrive.    Manual Reset  The SGM860 provides a choice to use the manual  reset (nMR) pin to initial the device reset. The nMR  input is a logic signal provided externally from other  processors, logic circuits, and/or discrete sensors.  Because nMR is tied to SVS-1, nRESET1 is usually  taken as the primary source to reset for the processor.  When nMR goes low, nRESET1 is asserted. When  nMR goes high and SENSE1 is above the reset  threshold, nRESET1 is released when the delay time is  configured by the users. Knowing that the nMR pin is  pulled up internally through a 100k\u03a9 resisitor, connect  nMR to VDD or just leave it floating once it is  unnecessary to control it externally.  If more than one signal are used to control the nMR  function, please use multiple N-MOS transistors and a  pull-up resistor to combine the logic signals together by  wire-OR.    Watchdog Timer  The SGM860 has a specialized watchdog error output  named nWDO. The nWDO is very helpful to detect and  fix the hang-up problems of a processor. The watchdog  function is connected to SVS-1 as well. Details of timing  diagram for WDT is shown in Figure 7. When nRESET1  is released, the WDT starts to count down. A logic level  transition of WDI can reset the WDT and the timer  starts to count down. However, if no transition of logic  level is detected within tWDT, then the WDT is timeout  and will assert the nWDO. After the nWDO is asserted,  the device is latched unless a reset of nRESET1 is  activated. For example, a negative nMR pulse,  SENSE1 voltage is below VITN or VDD is off.  In order to reset the processor when the WDT timeout  event occurs, the user can combine the nWDO with  nRESET1 by wire-OR. In legacy applications, where  the WDT timeout asserts nRESET1, connect the  nWDO to nMR. Figure 15 shows the connections, and  Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the timing diagram.    Reset Output  In a typical application for SGM860, the user can  connect the nRESETx pin to a processor like DSP,  ASIC, FPGA and CPU as the reset input pin, or connect  it to a voltage regulator like DC/DC converter and LDO  as the enable input signal.  The reset outputs of SGM860A are open-drain  structure and pull-up resistors are needed to hold the  lines high if nRESETx is not asserted. The nRESETx  can be connected to other devices at correct voltage  level by connecting the pull-up resistor to the proper  voltage rails. Choose the pull-up resistor larger than  10k\u03a9 for the safe operation of output transistors. Any  combination of nRESETx can be combined into one  logic signal with the wire-OR logic.  The SGM860B provides push-pull reset outputs and  the logic high level is determined by VDD. Hence, the  pull-up resistor is not needed and the board area can  be saved. However, users must ensure that all interface  logic level are checked and all nRESETx connections  must match the VDD logic level.         Quad Supply Voltage Supervisors  SGM860  with Adjustable Delay and Watchdog Timer      16  NOVEMBER 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued)  The nRESET outputs are defined when the VDD is  higher than 0.9V. For the proper reset of the processor,  VDD should be provided as early as possible in the  application circuits. The initial power-on state is shown  in Figure 2. Table 1 to Table 4 describe how the outputs  are asserted or released. Timing diagrams of SVS-x  are shown in Figure 3 to Figure 6. Once the conditions  are qualified, the SVS-x transfers from asserted to  released after a delay time set by the user. But the  SVS-x transfers from released to asserted immediately  with minimum propagation delay. The relationship  between threshold voltages (VITN, VHYSN) and SENSEy  voltage is depicted in Figure 5. SVS-1 to SVS-4 have  the same behavior like Figure 5.    Device Functional Modes  Table 1 to Table 5 provide the state of different parts  under specialized cases.  Table 1.

Once the voltage at SENSEy (y = 1, 2,  3, 4L) drops below VITN, the corresponding reset pin  goes low. If the voltage at SENSE4H is higher than VITP,  the nRESET4 is activated. In order to smooth the  transitions  between  reset  output  assertion  or  deassertion, an internal hysteresis is added to the  comparators. To suppress the noise caused by  transients, layout parasitics and interference between  power rails, place a bypass capacitor in the range of  1nF to 10nF at SENSEy. Figure 15 shows a typical  connection of the resisitor divider network.

Delay Timing Selection  CTx Connection  Delay Time  Pull up to VDD  315ms (TYP)  Open  21ms (TYP)  Capacitor to GND  Programmable    In order to set the delay time as 315ms, a pull-up  resistor in the range of 40k\u2126 to 200k\u2126 should be  placed between the CTx pin and VDD. When the device  powers up, a pull-down transistor connected between  CTx and GND turns on to decide and check the CTx  status. Therefore, a large current flow is aroused for the  direct connection between CTx and GND. As for setting  a fixed delay time of 21ms, keep the CTx pin floating.  To set a delay time defined by the user, put a capacitor  between CTx and GND and the delay time can be  calculated as follows:  ( ) ( ) ( ) CT DELAY C nF t ms 0.5 ms 0.23 \uf8ee \uf8f9 = \u2212 \u00d7 \uf8f0 \uf8fb       (8)  With Equation 8, a delay time from 1.45ms to 10s can  be obtained. For the SGM860, to identify the  capacitance between CTx and GND from a floating pin,  choose the external capacitor greater than 220pF. The  reset delay time is decided when the external capacitor  voltage is charged to 1.24V by the on-chip and highly  accurate current source of 285nA. Once the nRESET  signal is asserted, the external capacitor is discharged.  On the contrary, the internal current source is activated  and starts to charge the external capacitor when the  condition for releasing nRESETx occurs. If the CTx  voltage rises up to 1.24V, the corresponding nRESET is  released. As for the capacitor, choose a low leakage  one such as ceramic capacitor. Note that the reset  delay time may be different from the one set by users  because of the stray capacitance at this pin. The CTx  pins are susceptible to interference, and their routing  should be as short as possible, requiring shielding  treatment.    Typical Application  Design Requirements  The circuit provided in Figure 15 is designed to  supervise the voltage condition in an FPGA. Detailed  requirements are given in Table 7.  Table 7.

It  is a good analog practice to place a 0.1\u03bcF capacitor  between VDD and GND. The input power supply must  be higher than 1.8V normally to avoid reset activated by  the internal UVLO circuit.    Layout  Some guidelines are given below to prepare the layout  of the printed-circuit board (PCB) for SGM860.  1) CTx pins routing should be as short as possible to  improve accuracy and require shielding treatment.  2) Take short traces from SENSEy to the resistor  divider and long traces from RSxH to VMON_x.  3) Connect the VDD capacitor as close as possible to  the device.  4) Use short traces to connect VDD. The parasitic  inductance from the supply to the capacitor and the  capacitor at VDD form an LC tank and may lead to ring  voltages that higher than the maximum allowed VDD  voltage.

{"product_name": "SGM3795", "question": "What is the function of the EN/PWM pin in the SGM3795 device?", "answer": "The EN/PWM pin in the SGM3795 device serves two major functions. Firstly, it acts as an enabling pin for the device wherein the device is activated when the EN/PWM pin is set high from a shutdown state. If the EN/PWM stays low and the holding time surpasses tPWRDWN, the device enters shutdown mode. Secondly, the EN/PWM pin functions to control the current sink ON and OFF, aiding in achieving PWM dimming control. When EN/PWM equals high, the LED channel current quickly rises to ISET. When EN/PWM equals low, the LED channel current quickly drops to zero.", "content": "DETAILED DESCRIPTION  EN/PWM Operation  The EN/PWM pin is a multi-function pin. The first  function of the EN/PWM pin is to enable the device. Set  EN/PWM high to enable the device from the shutdown  state. The device will enter shutdown mode if the  EN/PWM remains low and the holding time exceeds  tPWRDWN. The second function is to realize the current  sink ON and OFF control, to achieve the PWM dimming  control. When EN/PWM = high, the LED channel  current will quickly rise to ISET. When EN/PWM = low,  the LED channel current will quickly drop to 0.  The SGM3795 allows the LED channel to be turned ON  or OFF in a very short time.  It is recommended to use PWM signals from 100Hz to  5kHz for linear dimming, and the duty cycle can support  a minimum of 1%. In addition, the PWM frequency can  be up to 50kHz, but the duty cycle must be greater than  10%.  When operating at a low PWM frequency or low PWM  duty cycle, the SGM3795 may enter shutdown mode  due to PWM low time longer than tPWRDWN. However,  PWM dimming accuracy is not affected, because the  turn-on time tPS is less than 1\u00b5s and much shorter than  the PWM high or low time.  The EN/PWM high time must be longer than 3\u00b5s and  the EN/PWM low time must be longer than 1.5\u00b5s. In  this case, the PWM pulse can be reliably detected.    Basic Operation  By connecting an appropriate resistance in series at the  ISET pin, the SGM3795 can achieve four-channel  high-precision dimming control with a high matching  rate. The four LED channel currents obtain the same  reference current with the help of the current mirror,  and the formula is as follows:  LED ISET 1.2V I 110 R \u2245 \u00d7                (1)   The selections of typical resistance values and LED  channel current values are shown in Table 1.

RISET Resistor Settings  LED Current (mA)  ISET (k\u03a9)  20  6.57  60  2.20  100  1.33  120  1.10  175  0.750    Each current channel is equipped with an independent  current control loop that ensures accurate current  regulation over a range of current sink voltages.  However, too high of a current sink voltage will lead to  more power loss and overheating of the device.  Therefore, the current sink voltage is recommended to  control below 1.5V.  The SGM3795 supports up to 175mA per channel, and  headroom voltages higher than 275mV per LED  channel are required to ensure accurate channel  currents. Once VIN voltage drops below 2.4V, the  device will disable all LED channels due to UVLO.  Leave the unused pin open.  Tying the LED channels together allows the device to  be used for high than 175mA current application. The  SGM3795 supports up to 700mA application when all 4  LED channels are connected together.  In order to ensure the safe operation of the SGM3795,  the voltage of the LED channel needs to be controlled  below 22V.    LED Short Protection  The SGM3795 can detect an LED string short event.  When any LED pin\u2019s current sink voltage is higher than  9.5V, a short event is detected, and the LED channel\u2019s  current will drop to 40% of ISET to reduce the power  dissipation. The LED channel current will return to ISET  when the current sink voltage is dropped below 7.0V.    Thermal Shutdown  Thermal shutdown (TSD) is triggered when the device  die temperature reaches +150\u2103, and all LED channels  are disabled. The LED channels automatically starts up  again when the die temperature drops to +130\u2103.       700mA Quad Channel  SGM3795  Constant Current LED Driver      10  NOVEMBER 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  "}

By adding resistor R2, Zener diode Z, and an N-channel  transistor M, SGM3795 can be powered with supply  voltage above 5.5V. On Semiconductor MM3Z6V2  Zener diode and 2N7002L N-channel transistor are  recommended.    Figure 4. 12V Power Supply Application with 12LEDs    Daylight Detection  SGM3795 can be used as a daylight detection circuit  with a light sensor, as shown in Figure 5. With light  sensor sensing the ambient brightness, the SGM3795  can be enabled during the day and disabled at night. A  resistor R1 is used to properly regulate the voltage of  the EN/PWM pin. Microsemi LX1972 is recommended  as the light sensor.    Figure 5. Daylight Detection    Nightlight Detection  SGM3795 can also be used as a nightlight detection  circuit with a light sensor, as shown in Figure 6. With  light sensors sensing the ambient brightness, the  SGM3795 can be disabled during the day and enabled  at night. In order to properly configure SGM3795 for  night detection, five external components need to be  configured in Figure 6. Similarly, Microsemi LX1972 is  recommended  as  the  light  sensor  and  ON  Semiconductor 2N7002L is recommended as the  N-Channel transistor.    Figure 6. Nightlight Detection    LED Current Derating  The circuit shown in Figure 7 protects the LED from  over-heating by derating the LED current to avoid  over-driving  the  LED  in  a  high-temperature  environment. In practical applications, a thermistor RPTC  can be used to sense the temperature of the LED, and  the RPTC should be placed as close as possible to the  LED. When the LED temperature increases, the gate  voltage of MOSFET M1 decreases, which leads to an  increase in the M1 on-resistance, resulting in a  decrease in the LED current. Vishay PTCSS12T071DTE  is  recommended  as  the  thermistor  and  ON  Semiconductor 2N7002L N-channel transistor are  recommended.  The PCB and heat dissipation for the LED should be  considered so that the LED current is constant within  the normal temperature range. However, once the  ambient temperature exceeds the maximum threshold,  this circuit will reduce the LED current to avoid LED  burnout.    Figure 7.

High VLEDN voltage and ILEDN current  will cause the SGM3795 to frequently enter the thermal  shutdown, especially in high temperature environments.  By inserting a suitable resistor with the LED string, the  VLEDN  can  be  reduced  to  reduce  the  power  consumption.  Two main heat dissipation paths determine the thermal  resistance. The first path is determined by the package,  which is the thermal resistance (\u03b8JC) of the connection  to the shell. The other path, depending on the layout, is  the thermal resistance (\u03b8CA) of the shell to the  environment. In summary, the thermal resistance to the  environment (\u03b8JA) is equal to:  JA JC CA \u03b8 \u03b8 \u03b8 = +                  (3)  When the package and layout are determined, the  operating junction temperature can be calculated by the  following equation:  JC CA JA J AMB D AMB D T T P (\u03b8 \u03b8 ) T P \u03b8 = + + = +        (4)  When mounted on a two-sided printed circuit board  with two square inches of copper, the \u03b8JA in the  TDFN-2\u00d73-8L package is 51.7\u00b0C/W.  For example, the maximum power consumption for the  TDFN-2\u00d73-8L at +30\u2103 is as follows:  JMAX AMB D JA T - T 150 - 30 P 2.32W \u03b8 51.7 = = =       (5)    Recommended Layout  A small ceramic capacitor should be placed as close as  possible to the VIN pin to filter and regulate the power  supply. The RISET resistor is connected to the GND pin  of the SGM3795 by Kelvin connection. GND plane  must be as close as possible to the GND of LED power  to provide shortest possible return path and smallest  possible current loops.  Figure 8 shows the layout recommendation for the  SGM3795 in the TDFN package, which uses a  through-hole to connect the exposed pad to the large  ground plane underneath, allowing the board layout to  provide good heat consumption.

Exposure to  absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods  may affect reliability. Functional operation of the device at any  conditions beyond those indicated in the Recommended  Operating Conditions section is not implied.    ESD SENSITIVITY CAUTION  This integrated circuit can be damaged by ESD if you don\u2019t  pay attention to ESD protection. SGMICRO recommends that  all integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions.  Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures  can cause damage. ESD damage can range from subtle  performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision  integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage  because very small parametric changes could cause the  device not to meet its published specifications.

{"product_name": "SGM58031Q", "question": "What are the two working modes of the SGM58031Q?", "answer": "The two working modes of the SGM58031Q are single-shot mode and continuous conversion mode.", "content": "DETAILED DESCRIPTION  Overview  The SGM58031Q is a low-power, 16-bit, delta-sigma (\u0394\u03a3)  analog-to-digital converter (ADC).  The SGM58031Q supports both differential inputs and  single-ended inputs.  The SGM58031Q has two working modes: single-shot mode  and continuous conversion mode.  In single-shot mode, the ADC performs one conversion and  gives full settled data, while no data needs to be discarded.  Once ADC completes the conversion, it then goes to  low-power shutdown mode.   In continuous modes, the ADC begins a new conversion  automatically after a previous conversion is completed. Every  conversion result is given out. The data rate is equal to the  configured data rate.    Quickstart Guide  The basic connection of ADC is shown in Figure 3. The  communication interface is I2C compatible. The SGM58031Q  works in slave mode. The I2C address is configured as  0b1001000 (ADDR is connected to GND).  Figure 4 and Figure 5 show the demo read and write  operation sequences.  For example, writing to the configuration register 0x01 sets  the SGM58031Q to continuous conversion mode following  the order below:  1. First byte, 0b1001000 (first 7-bit is I2C address), the 8th bit  is read/write bit which is low writing now  2. Second byte, 0b00000001 (points to Config register 0x01)  3. Third byte, 0b10000100 (MSB of the Config register to be  written, Bit[8] = 0 means the continuous mode)  4. Fourth byte, 0b10000011 (LSB of the Config register to be  written, Bit[7:5] = 100 means data rate 100Hz)  For example, to read the conversion result from SGM58031Q,  the following order can be followed:  1. First byte, 0b1001000 (first 7-bit is I2C address), the 8th bit  is read/write bit which is low writing now  2. Second byte, 0b00000000 (points to Conversion register  0x00)  3. Third byte, 0b10010001 (first 7-bit is I2C address), the 8th  bit is read/write bit which is high reading now  4. Fourth byte, the SGM58031Q answers with the MSB of the  Conversion register  5.

Except for effects of INL, noise, offset, and gain errors.    Aliasing  For some applications, an RC external filtering is recommended.    Operating Modes  The SGM58031Q has two working modes, continuous mode  and single-shot mode.  In continuous mode, the ADC begins a new conversion  automatically after a previous conversion is completed. Every  conversion result is given out.  In single-shot mode, if OS bit is written to 1, a single-shot  conversion is started, during the conversion process, the OS  bit is kept 0, and the chip doesnt response to OS bit  operation. If conversion data is ready, the OS bit is set to 1  and the chip goes power-down automatically, and user can  write 1 to OS bit to call a single-shot conversion again.    Power-Up and Reset  When the SGM58031Q is powered up, all registers are reset  to default values.  The SGM58031Q supports I2C general call reset command.  Refer to I2C General Call section for more details.    Duty Cycling for Low Power  In some power sensitive application, the SGM58031Q can  work in sampling and power-down mode periodically. The  duty cycle of working time and power-down time can be  controlled by microcontroller flexibly.   For example, if the SGM58031Q is configured as sample data  rate at 960Hz, it can be operated with 125ms duty cycle. This  means that the chip needs to do single-shot conversion every  125ms, it will take the chip 3.2ms for sampling and then stay  in power-down mode for 121.8ms. Under this working mode,  it will reduce 39/40 power consumption compare with 960Hz  operation in continuous mode.       Ultra-Small, Low-Power, 16-Bit  SGM58031Q  Analog-to-Digital Converter with"}

A. 3  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  GENERAL DESCRIPTION  The SGM4917 is stereo headphone amplifier which is  designed for portable applications and can operate  from a 2.7V to 5.5V single supply. Capless design can  produce a ground-referenced output from a single  power supply, and can eliminate output DC-blocking  capacitors for less-component height and low-cost. For  SGM4917B, the internal gain setting (-2V/V) is to  further reduce component count. For SGM4917A, the  gain can be adjusted by external feedback resistors.  The SGM4917 has low quiescent current 2.7mA at 5V  supply, low 0.02% THD+N, 80mW per channel into  32\u2126 load from 5V power supply at THD+N = 0.1%. The  high supply rejection ratio (PSRR) of -78dB at 217Hz  allows the device to operate from noisy digital supplies  without an additional linear regulator. The device  provides short-circuit and thermal-overload protections.  Build-in shutdown control also helps for pop/click-free  on/off control.  The SGM4917 is available in a Green TQFN-3\u00d73-16L  package. It operates over an ambient temperature  range of -40\u2103 to +85\u2103.

A  23m\u03a9 low RDSON N-MOSFET is integrated. The two  clamping  output  threshold  voltages  can  be  programmed through VCP pin. The clamping voltage  protection function can ensure the safe operation of  surge events in any state.  The soft-start time can be adjusted by setting an  additional capacitor to the SST/nFAULT pin. Thermal  shutdown shuts off the output MOSFET if the die  temperature exceeds +150\u2103, and the output MOSFET  remains off until the die temperature drops to +130\u2103.  The SGM2526 is available in a Green TDFN-3\u00d73-10L  package and operates over a temperature range of -40\u2103  to +85\u2103.

Firstly, it uses an internal current limit amplifier for accurate current limit control. Secondly, in some abnormal conditions where the output may short to ground and increase device current rapidly, it uses a dedicated fast-trip comparator. This comparator shuts down the pass device very quickly when the output current is greater than the fast-trip current (IFAST-TRIP = 1.8 \u00d7 ILIM), thereby terminating the rapid short-circuit peak current. After the output short peak current has been terminated by the fast-trip comparator, the current limit amplifier smoothly regulates the output current to ILIM.", "content": "FUNCTIONAL BLOCK DIAGRAM  Soft-Start UVLO Charge Pump Current Limit VOUT Clamping Thermal Detection SST/nFAULT IN EN GND OUT ILIM VCP Fast-Trip Comp (1) or Logic Control SGM2526     NOTES:  1.

It also has a wide operating voltage range from 4.5V to 22V and a maximum load current of 5A. It can also provide protection and current limit for AC/DC power supplies. In the event of a sudden fluctuation of the AC input voltage, the SGM2526 can regulate the output voltage. It also requires accurate current sensing and overload protection for the secondary side output port. In addition, SGM2526 can provide precision current limits in intrinsic safety applications. Moreover, it can be used as a smart load switch, offering programmable current limits, programmable soft-start, over-temperature protection, fault flag and under-voltage lockout.", "content": "APPLICATION EXAMPLES  The SGM2526 provides a complete set of protection  functions for overload or inrush current. The wide  operating voltage range (4.5V to 22V) is specifically  designed for many popular DC buses, and the  maximum load current of 5A can meet the power  delivery requirements of many devices.    Protection and Current Limit for AC/DC  Power Supplies  In many small household appliances, portable devices,  consumer products and other application scenarios, the  primary-side power supplies and adapter are dominant.  \u2022 No secondary-side protection which can stop  short-circuit and other key faults immediately.   \u2022 Cannot provide precision current limit for overload  transients.   \u2022 Poor ability to regulate the output voltage during  sudden fluctuation of the AC input voltage, when the  output over-voltage condition is triggered.   Therefore, accurate current sensing and overload  protection are required for the secondary side output  port in the above applications. This requires the use of  precision operational amplifiers for additional circuit  implementation. It adds complexity to the solution and  leads to a loss of sensing. The SGM2526 adopting  N-MOSFET with low on-resistance is a simple and  efficient solution. The typical application circuit of  SGM2526 is shown in Figure 2.    Precision Current Limit in Intrinsic Safety  Applications  The safe operation of electrical and electronic  equipment in dangerous area environment has a more  and more urgent requirements for intensive safety (IS).  IS requires that the total energy available during  equipment operation is not enough to ignite the  surrounding explosive environment by means of  electric sparks or heat transfer. This requires precision  current limits to ensure that the set current limits are not  exceeded over a wide operating temperature range and  variable environmental conditions. Applications such as  gas analyzers, medical devices, portal industrial  equipment, etc., need to meet these importance safety  standards. As a simple over-voltage and over-load  protection solution, the SGM2526 is applicable to each  power rail inside the system application.

This feature is only available in SGM2596D. It includes an internal integrated quick output discharge to remove the remaining charge from the output when the switch is disabled.", "content": "DETAILED DESCRIPTION  Overview  The SGM2596 and SGM2596D are 5.7V, 16m\u03a9 (TYP)  on-resistance, integrated two N-MOSFETs, dual-channel  load switches. Each channel can support a 6A maximum  continuous load current and be enabled independently  by the ONx pin. The devices have independent control  pin to set the slew rate (or the soft-start time) of VOUTx  for each channel, which can control the inrush current  and reduce the voltage drop. The devices also have the  thermal shutdown function. Only SGM2596D includes  internal integrated quick output discharge (QOD) to  remove the remaining charge from the output when the  switch is disabled.  SGM2596 and SGM2596D are highly integrated. Using  SGM2596 or SGM2596D can reduce the PCB area and  the BOM count greatly, even the cost.    VBIAS Power Supply  VBIAS is the power supply to the inner circuit including  control logic, quick output discharge and charge pump.  The support voltage range is from 2.5V to 5.7V. For  most applications, a 0.1\u00b5F capacitor is sufficient. It is  recommended to use X5R or X7R dielectrics ceramic  capacitor.    Input Capacitor  Turning on the N-MOSFET to charge load capacitor will  generate inrush current, which may cause the VIN drop.  In order to prevent the drop, a capacitor must be placed  between the VINx and GND pins. Usually, a 1\u03bcF input  capacitor (CIN) placed close to the pins is sufficient.  However, higher capacitance values could further  reduce the voltage drop. So, larger CIN can be used to  reduce the voltage drop in high current applications.     Output Capacitor  A 0.1\u03bcF output capacitor (COUT) should be placed  between the VOUTx and GND pins. This capacitor can  prevent parasitic board inductance from forcing VOUTx  below GND when the switch is turned on. It is  recommended that CIN is greater than COUT.  Control Pin  There is an independent control pin ONx to turn on or  turn off the corresponding N-MOSFET for each channel.  When the ONx pin is driven high, the switch will be  turned on, and when the ONx pin is driven low, the  switch will be turned off. The ONx pin is compatible with  standard GPIO logic level threshold, such as 1.2V,  1.8V, 2.5V or 3.3V.  The recommended start-up sequence is: VBIAS power  on first, then VINx power on, and finally to enable the  ONx. Or VINx and VBIAS power on simultaneously, then  the ONx is enabled.   The ONx pin cannot be left floating and must be  connected to either high or low level as requirement.    Soft-Start Control  A capacitor between CTX and GND pins determines the  slew rate of VOUT for each channel. The slew rate can  be calculated using the below equation.  SR = 0.55 \u00d7 CT                 (1)  So, the soft-start time of VOUT is:   tSS = SR \u00d7 VOUT = 0.55 \u00d7 CT \u00d7 VOUT        (2)  where:  SR is the slew rate (in \u00b5s/V).  CT is the capacitance value on the CTx pin (in pF).  tSS is the soft-start time of VOUT.  For the desired rise time performance, the capacitor  voltage rating used on this pin must be 10V or above.  When CT < 100pF, the equation cannot be applied. The  recommended value of CT is bigger than 100pF. If CT =  0pF or left floating, use Table 4 to determine rise times.  The soft-start time is valid only when the ONx pin is  enabled after VINx and VBIAS are ready.

Each channel has a resistor which is not activated to  discharge by default. When the ONx pin is pulled low or  VBIAS is lower than 2.2V (TYP) or over-temperature  happens, the resistor will be connected between the  VOUTx and GND to discharge the output quickly. This  resistor pulls down the output and prevents it from  floating when the switch is turned off.    Thermal Shutdown  Thermal shutdown protects the device from excessive  temperature and can recovery automatically. When die  temperature exceeds +160\u2103 (TYP), both MOSFETs  will be shut down and remained off until die  temperature drops below +140\u2103 (TYP).

Typical Application Circuit    Design Requirements  Table 3 shows the SGM2596 design parameters of one  channel.  Table 3. Design Parameters  Design Parameter  Value  Input Voltage (VINx)  3.3V  Bias Voltage (VBIAS)  5V  Load Capacitance (CL)  22\u00b5F  Maximum Acceptable Inrush Current (IINRUSH)  500mA    Detailed Design Procedure  Inrush Current  When the switch is enabled, VOUTx begins to soft-start  from 0V linearly. Inrush current can be calculated by  the following formula.  IINRUSH = CL \u00d7 dVOUT/dt           (3)    Soft-Start Time  From the Equation 3, we can also calculate the  soft-start time.  tSS = CL \u00d7 VOUT/IINRUSH           (4)  In this example: CL = 22\u03bcF, VOUTx = VINx = 3.3V, IINRUSH =  500mA.  So,  tSS = 22\u03bcF \u00d7 3.3V/500mA \u2248 145.2\u03bcs     (5)  To ensure an inrush current is less than 500mA, the  soft-start time cannot be less than 145.2\u03bcs. The next,  we only need to choose a CT value to meet the desired  soft-start time.     CT Selection  From equation,  tSS = 0.55 \u00d7 CT \u00d7 VOUT           (6)  We can calculate the CT \u2248 80pF.  From the section of soft-start control, we know that  when CT < 100pF, the equation cannot be applied and  the calculated value is not accurate. So we need to  choose more than 100pF capacitor which value is close  and universal. Finally, CT = 220pF is chosen.  We can also refer the following Table 4 to choose CT.  The tR (the rise time from 10% to 90% of VOUTx) at  different CT have been measured under CL = 0.1\u00b5F, CIN  = 1\u00b5F and RL = 10\u03a9.  If tSS is known, we can also know tR = 0.8 \u00d7 tSS \u2248  116.2\u03bcs.  According to the tR, look up Table 4 to get the  recommended value CT which sets the rise time not be  less than the calculated.  When CT is left floating, the rise times can be obtained  from CT = 0pF listed in Table 4.

Layout Guidelines  For the best operation of device, the following  guidelines must be strictly followed:  \uf077  All high-current traces (VINx and VOUTx) could be  as short and wide as possible. It is recommended  to use ground copper pour. Special attention  should be paid to that size and number of via must  be enough for a given current.  \uf077  The input and output capacitors should be placed  as close as possible to the device.  \uf077  Decoupling capacitors of VBIAS should be placed  next to the VBIAS pin.  \uf077  Place the CT capacitor close to the CTx pin.  \uf077  Use sufficient thermal vias to directly connect the  exposed thermal pad to the ground plane on the  bottom layer under the body of IC, which can  relieve the thermal further and achieve better  thermal performance.    Layout Example  VIN1 Capacitor VIN2 Capacitor VOUT1 Capacitor VOUT2 Capacitor CT1 Capacitor CT2 Capacitor Thermal Relief Vias   Thermal Considerations  Assuming a given ambient temperature and package  thermal resistance, the maximum allowable power  dissipation is calculated by:  \u2212 = J(MAX) A D(MAX) JA T T P \u03b8   where:  \uf077  PD(MAX) is the maximum power dissipation.  \uf077  TJ(MAX) is the maximum operating junction temperature.  \uf077  TA is the operating ambient temperature.  \uf077  \u03b8JA is the package thermal resistance.   The maximum operating junction temperature must be  restricted to +125\u2103 under normal operating conditions.  Care should be taken that the thermal vias are placed  under the exposed pad of the device, thus allowing for  thermal dissipation away from the device.

{"product_name": "SGM3838", "question": "What function does the under-voltage lockout (UVLO) serve in the device described in the text?", "answer": "The under-voltage lockout (UVLO) function in the device described in the text serves to monitor the input voltage and disable the device when the input voltage is too low to operate.", "content": "DETAILED DESCRIPTION  Under-Voltage Lockout (UVLO)  The built-in under-voltage lockout function (UVLO)  monitors the input voltage and disables the device  when the input voltage is too low to operate.    Thermal Shutdown (TSD)  The device has a function of thermal shutdown, which  prevents the device from damage due to overheating  and excessive power dissipation. The device stops  switching and shuts down all the outputs when the  junction temperature exceeds +145 \u2103 (TYP), and  restarts with the same programmed voltages and  sequences when the temperature decreases to +135\u2103  (TYP).    Boost Converter VO1 (ELVDD)  The Boost converter VO1 operates with a valley-  current-mode topology and fixed 1.45MHz (TYP)  frequency.  The  VO1  output  voltage  can  be  programmed between 4.6V and 5.0V (default 4.6V)  with 100mV steps (see Table 2).  The output sense pin (FBS) is always connected to the  positive pin of output capacitor for the highest output  voltage accuracy. The wide hysteresis voltage makes  the device suitable for large path loss applications.  Additionally, the Boost converter can sense the output  voltage with the VO1 pin, when the FBS pin is floating  or connected to ground or connected as close to the  VO1 pin as possible.  The output of VO1 is fully isolated in shutdown mode.    Inverting Buck-Boost Converter VO2  (ELVSS)  The inverting Buck-Boost converter VO2 operates with a  peak-current-mode topology and dual-phase fixed  1.25MHz (TYP) frequency. The VO2 output voltage can  be programmed between -6.0V to -0.8V (default -3.0V)  with 100mV steps (see Table 2).  When the load current exceeds 260mA, phase A and  phase B of the inverting Buck-Boost converter both  work. And only phase A works when the load current  decreases to 150mA for reducing the switching loss.  The output of VO2 is fully isolated in shutdown mode.    Boost Converter VO3 (AVDD)  The Boost converter VO3 operates with a peak-current-  mode topology and fixed 1.45MHz (TYP) frequency.  The VO3 output voltage can be programmed between  5.5V and 7.9V (default 7.3V) with 100mV steps (see  Table 2).  The output of VO3 is fully isolated in shutdown mode.    Output Current Capacity  The device operates with an input voltage range of  2.5V to 4.8V. However, due to different input voltage  and different output voltage, the output current capacity  is quite different. A lower input voltage or a higher  output voltage leads to a lower output current capacity.    Input Power Supply  The input power supply voltage is recommended  between 2.5V and 4.8V. To achieve full performance, a  stable and noise-free input source is needed. Once the  distance between input source and SGM3838 is a bit  long, additional capacitors are suggested to place as  close to the device as possible. Please refer to the  typical application circuit for the suggested input  capacitance.  SGMICRO has patented circuits to solve the spike  problem of VELVDD due to mode switching when the  input voltage rises close to or higher than the  programmed VELVDD.    Fault Protection Status (SHT)  The SHT is an interface to indicate a fault protection  (SCP, UVLO) status. SHT is internally pulled up to AVIN  through a 600k\u03a9 resistor, and it will be pulled down to  AGND when fault protection (SCP or UVLO) occurs.

Figure 2 shows an example for SGM3838 programming  VELVSS to -2.4V. The SWIRE pin can be used as a  standard enable pin if programming is not required.  The device starts with its default values (green marked  values in Table 2) if enabled. The SWIRE interface  counts the rising edges to set the corresponding values  as shown in Table 2. The device utilizes a volatile  memory to store the settings.    Table 2.

The output discharge function can be controlled by both  nFD pin and SWIRE interface, where SWIRE interface  has the higher priority. The discharge function follows  the connection status of nFD pin until SWIRE pulse 79  or 80 is applied. In this case, if nFD = low or high  impedance, all outputs are discharged when the device  is shutdown. Once SWIRE counts 79 (discharge function  ON) or 80 (discharge function OFF) pulses, the function  follows the SWIRE.  Toggling SWIRE high or with relevant pulses enables  the VO1 Boost converter. VO1 starts with a 0.2A  soft-start current limit until it rises to the programmed  voltage. Then the full current limit is active (2.0A, TYP).  5ms after toggling SWIRE high, the VO2 converter  starts switching phase A (VO2A) with a 0.7A current  limit until the VO2 rises to the default voltage (-3V).  Then the full current limit is active (2.65A and 1.65A for  phase A and phase B respectively, TYP).  Toggling VO3_EN high starts the VO3 Boost converter.  Before VO3 rises to the default value (7.3V), it rises  linearly for 1.5ms with a 0.35A current limit. Then the  full current limit is active (1A, TYP).    Overload and Short Circuit Protection (SCP)  The built-in short circuit protection (SCP) prevents the  device from damage. If any of the three outputs (VO1,  VO2 and VO3) is shorted to the ground or VO1 and  VO2 are shorted together, the SGM3838 will trigger the  function.  When a short or an overload occurs, all the three  converters stop switching, the outputs are shut down  and latched.  Only resetting the power supply or pulling VO3_EN and  SWIRE low at the same time for more than tOFF can  restart the device.  A SCP or overload occurs if any of the following events  happens:  - VELVDD is not in regulation 2.12ms after VELVDD is  enabled (SWIRE = high for longer than 2.12ms) then all  converters shut down.  - VELVSS is not in regulation 5.6ms after VELVSS is  enabled (SWIRE = high for longer than 10ms) then all  converters shut down.  - VAVDD protection is enabled when the soft-start is  completed.  - VELVDD falls below 81% of the programmed output  voltage longer than 0.71ms "}

{"product_name": "SGM42610/SGM42611", "question": "What happens when the FAULT pin of the SGM42611B is driven low?", "answer": "When the FAULT pin of the SGM42611B is driven low, it indicates that a fault condition such as Over-Current Protection (OCP) or Thermal Shutdown (TSD) has occurred. If this happens during OCP, all MOSFETs in the H-bridge are disabled and normal operation will resume only after the fault condition is no longer present and after a set retry period has passed. In the case of TSD, all output drivers are disabled until the die temperature falls back to a safe level, at which point operation will automatically resume.", "content": "DETAILED DESCRIPTION  IN/FAULT Operation  For SGM42610/11A, IN4/FAULT is an enable input or  alert output pin. If this pin is pulled high more than tFAULT,  it can be used to alert output; in other cases, this pin is  just as logic input controls state of OUTx.  For SGM42611B, the FAULT is a separate fault flag pin.  When OCP or TSD occurs, the FAULT pin will be driven  low.    Under-Voltage Lockout (UVLO)   If at any time, the voltage on the VCC pin falls below  the under-voltage lockout threshold, all output drivers  are disabled, and all internal logic will be reset.  Operation will resume when VCC rises above the UVLO  threshold. The FAULT pin is not driven low in the event  of an under-voltage condition.    EN Operation  The EN pin of SGM42611B is an enable or sleep mode  input. When the EN pin is logic low for less than tSLEEP,  all output drivers are disabled, as shown in Table 3.  After the EN pin is pulled low more than tSLEEP, the  device will enter into a low power sleep mode. In this  state, the output drivers are disabled, all internal logic is  reset, and internal clocks are stopped. All inputs are  ignored until EN returns inactive high. The internal  pull-down resistor of EN pin is approximately 100k\u03a9.  The FAULT pin is not driven low in the event of a low  power sleep mode.    Over-Current Protection (OCP)   An analog current limit circuit on each MOSFET limits  the current through the MOSFET by limiting the gate  drive. If this analog current limit persists for longer than  the OCP deglitch time (tOCP), all MOSFETs in the  H-bridge will be disabled and the FAULT pin will be  driven low. The driver will be re-enabled after the OCP  retry period (tRETRY) has passed. If the fault condition is  still present, the cycle repeats. If the fault is no longer  present, normal operation resumes and the FAULT pin  becomes high again after 2ms. Please note that only  the H-bridge in which the OCP is detected will be  disabled while the other H-bridge will function normally  (OUT1 and OUT2 form an H-bridge, OUT3 and OUT4  form another H-bridge).  Over-current conditions are detected independently on  both high-side and low-side devices. For example, a  short across the motor winding will all result in an  over-current shutdown.    Thermal Shutdown (TSD)  If the die temperature exceeds safe limit, all output  drivers are disabled and the FAULT pin will be driven  low. Once the die temperature has fallen to a safe level  operation will automatically resume.                                    "}

Circuit to Drive Heavy Capacitive Load    Power Supply Decoupling and Layout  A clean and low noise power supply is very important in  amplifier circuit design, besides of input signal noise,  the power supply is one of important source of noise to  the amplifier through +VS and -VS pins. Power supply  bypassing is an effective method to clear up the noise  at power supply, and the low impedance path to ground  of decoupling capacitor will bypass the noise to GND.  In application, 10\u03bcF ceramic capacitor paralleled with  0.1\u03bcF or 0.01\u03bcF ceramic capacitor is used in Figure 2.  The ceramic capacitors should be placed as close as  possible to +VS and -VS power supply pins.         Figure 2. Amplifier Power Supply Bypassing    Grounding  In low speed application, one node grounding technique  is the simplest and most effective method to eliminate  the noise generated by grounding. In high speed  application, the general method to eliminate noise is to  use a complete ground plane technique, and the whole  ground plane will help distribute heat and reduce EMI  noise pickup.    Reduce Input-to-Output Coupling  To reduce the input-to-output coupling, the input traces  must be placed as far away from the power supply or  output traces as possible. The sensitive trace must not  be placed in parallel with the noisy trace in same layer.  They must be placed perpendicularly in different layers  to reduce the crosstalk. These PCB layout techniques  will help to reduce unwanted positive feedback and  noise.

The device supports rail-to-rail input and  output operation, and consumes low quiescent current.  It can also provide a high slew rate. The combination of  characteristics makes SGM8417A-1 suitable for LCD  applications.    Operating Voltage  The SGM8417A-1 is guaranteed to operate from 4.5V  to 24V, and the operation is extremely stable over the  whole specified range of the temperature. The output  voltage swing can be closer to the supply rail by  reducing the load current.    LCD Panel Application  The SGM8417A-1 can provide optimal performance in  LCD VCOM buffer.

Short-Circuit Protection  The output can be shorted to \u00b1VS for 60 seconds and  the supply-to-output differential voltage must be less  than |12V|, else the SGM8417A-1 may be damaged.    Thermal Consideration  When operating the device, the users need to make  sure that the junction temperature is below the absolute  maximum one. The junction temperature is increasing  because the power dissipation is higher than before. And  a lot of possibilities can cause the thermal considerations,  such as the width of trace in PCB, the package of the  device, the gap between ambient and junction temperature  and rate of environmental airflow.  When the die temperature exceeds the threshold value  of thermal shutdown, the output will be in high  impedance state and it will remain in this state until the  die temperature decreases to +120\u2103.  The following equation indicates the calculation of power  dissipation:  PD(MAX) = (TJ(MAX) - TA)/\u03b8JA         (1)  where:  TJ(MAX) = Maximum junction temperature.   TA = Ambient temperature.  \u03b8JA = Junction to ambient thermal resistance.  It is recommended that the junction temperature should  not exceed +125\u2103 for normal operation. The parameter  of ambient thermal resistance is determined by the  width of trace in PCB layout.  In addition, the ambient temperature and thermal  resistance  will affect the power dissipation  of  SGM8417A-1.    Layout  For the circuits with high power path, a good PCB  design is essential. It is recommended to use the  following layout method to improve the performance of  SGM8417A-1 at most.  \uf077 The power component should be close enough to  SGM8417A-1 for better performance. Also, if the high  current is necessary, the corresponding trace in PCB  should be short and wide.  \uf077 For some applications such as filtering, a series  resistor is necessary to be added at the output of the  device.  \uf077 Choosing a suitable bypass capacitor can enhance  the stability when driving the loads with high transient.  For single-supply operation, the bypass capacitor  should be placed as close to +VS pin as possible. For  dual-supply operation, both +VS and -VS supplies  should be bypassed to ground with separate 0.1\u03bcF  ceramic capacitors. Using a 10\u03bcF tantalum capacitor is  a good choice to improve the operating stability of the  device when driving high transient load.  \uf077 A 0.1\u03bcF capacitor should be connected with +IN pin  to GND for better operation of SGM8417A-1 and the  distance between this capacitor and +IN pin should be  minimized.  \uf077 It is recommended to connect exposed pad to -VS  directly in the PCB.             24V, 1.5A Peak Output Current  SGM8417A-1   Rail-to-Rail I/O Operational Amplifier      7  JUNE 2023  SG Micro Corp  www.sg-micro.com  "}

The device is typically  used to generate +5V and -5V from battery.  High switching frequency minimizes the sizes of  inductor and capacitor. The device requires only three  external capacitors for a complete DC/DC charge pump  inverter. Integrated power MOSFETs and internal  compensation of boost DC/DC make the SGM3803  simple to use and optimized for compact solutions.  The negative charge pump inverter of the SGM3803 is  capable of providing 200mA output current. The typical  conversion efficiency exceeds 80% over a wide output  current range.  The SGM3803 boost DC/DC enters the power-save  mode at light loads to maintain high efficiency.  Anti-ringing control circuitry reduces EMI concerns by  damping the inductor in discontinuous mode. The  SGM3803  boost  DC/DC  provides  true  output  disconnect, thus allowing VOUT1 to go to zero volt during  shutdown without drawing any current from the input  source. The SGM3803 supports 1.8V logic for control.  The output voltage of the boost DC/DC can be  programmed by an external resistor divider. Boost  DC/DC and negative charge pump inverter have  independent enable control.  The device is available in a TDFN-3\u00d73-12L package.

A  GENERAL DESCRIPTION  The SGM4822/SGM4825 (single-input) and SGM4823/  SGM4826 (dual-input) are low noise, low power,  rail-to-rail,  fixed-gain  microphone  amplifiers  with  integrated bias. The SGM4822/SGM4823 support  power supply voltage from 3.3V to 5.5V and the  SGM4825/SGM4826 support wide power supply  voltage from 2.7V to 5.5V. The devices are suitable for  portable audio applications. They feature low THD+N =  0.009% in active mode, 2.6MHz bandwidth and forced  shutdown mode.   The SGM4822/SGM4823 power-saving features include  automatic switching between low power monitor mode  and low noise active mode, and the devices also  provide latched push-pull output to wake up external  MCU  in  sleeping  mode.  Two  inputs  of  the  SGM4823/SGM4826 allow two microphones to be  multiplexed into one output.  The devices operate over an ambient temperature  range of -40\u2103 to +85\u2103.
